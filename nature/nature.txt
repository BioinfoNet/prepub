[u'Detecting differential usage of exons from RNA-Seq data', ['Simon Anders', 'Alejandro Reyes', 'Wolfgang Huber'], u'2012-04-04', u'RNA-Seq is a powerful tool for the study of alternative splicing and other forms of alternative isoform expression. Understanding the regulation of these processes requires sensitive and specific detection of differential isoform abundance in comparisons between conditions, cell types or tissues. We present DEXSeq, a statistical method to test for differential exon usage in RNA-Seq data. DEXSeq employs generalized linear models and offers reliable control of false discoveries by taking biological variation into account. DEXSeq detects genes, and in many cases specific exons, that are subject to differential exon usage with high sensitivity. We demonstrate the versatility of DEXSeq by applying it to several data sets. The method facilitates the study of regulation and function of alternative exon usage on a genome-wide scale. An implementation of DEXSeq is available as an R/Bioconductor package.This preprint has subsequently been published in Genome Research (doi:10.1101/gr.133744.111)', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/6837/version/2', [u'Genetics & Genomics', u'Bioinformatics'], [u'European Molecular Biology Laboratory']]

This prevents them from entering the body through the intestinal tract, where they have the ability to attach themselves to vital organs and grow. This study reports the effective use of lower dose saponins like immunotoxin so that they can inhibit the proliferation of cancerous pancreatic cells.

Although the disease-causing gene (huntingtin) has been known for some time, the exact cause of neuronal cell death is still unknown. One potential mechanism contributing to the massive loss of neurons in the brain of HD patients might be the unfolded protein response (UPR), which is activated by accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER). As an adaptive response to counter-balance accumulation of un- or misfolded proteins, the UPR upregulates transcription of chaperones, temporarily attenuates new translation, and activates protein degradation via the proteasome. However, it is known that persistent ER stress and activated UPR can cause cell death by triggering of apoptosis. Nevertheless, the evidence linking UPR with HD progression remains inconclusive. Here, we present first analyses of UPR activation during HD based on available expression data. To elucidate the potential role of UPR as a disease-relevant process, we examine its connection to cell death and inflammatory processes.

Counts of less than 4.0 were found in \u2018resting\u2019 virus states; Counts greater than 4.0, found to be associated with rapid replication, were found invariably to accompany or to predict virus outbreaks, by as much as two years, in viral hosts examined from salmon, to birds, to livestock, to humans. X-ray diffraction showed Replikins to be on the surface of the hemagglutinin gene of influenza and to spread as the Count increased from 3.2 to 10.1, prior to, then during, the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. The degree of lethality of these outbreaks was found to be a function of the statistically significant increase in Replikin Count, particularly in the influenza polymerase gene p B1 or its equivalent in other viruses. Prediction up to two years in advance of the outbreak, and the geographic location of the outbreak, now done in 7/7 trials (see Bogoch, Nature Precedings), has permitted the solid phase synthesis of Replikin vaccines in 7 days, with time to permit manufacture, adequate testing for safety and efficacy, and distribution freeze-dried to all populations.

[u'Quantum Genetics and Quantum Automata Models of Quantum-Molecular Evolution Involved in the Evolution of Organisms and Species', ['I. C.

The representation of genomes and Interactome networks in categories of many-valued logic LMn \u2013algebras that are naturally transformed during biological evolution, or evolve through interactions with the environment provide a new insight into the mechanisms of molecular evolution, as well as organismal evolution, in terms of sequences of quantum automata.  Phenotypic changes are expressed only when certain environmentally-induced quantum-molecular changes are coupled with an internal re-structuring of major submodules of the genome and Interactome networks related to cell cycling and cell growth. Contrary to the commonly held view of \u2018standard\u2019 Darwinist models of evolution, the evolution of organisms and species occurs through coupled multi-molecular transformations induced not only by the environment but actually realized through internal re-organizations of genome and interactome networks.  The biological, evolutionary processes involve certain epigenetic transformations that are responsible for phenotypic expression of the genome and Interactome transformations initiated at the quantum-molecular level. It can thus be said that only quantum genetics can provide correct explanations of evolutionary processes that are initiated at the quantum\u2014multi-molecular levels and propagate to the higher levels of organismal and species evolution.Biological evolution should be therefore regarded as a multi-scale process which is initiated by underlying quantum (coupled) multi-molecular transformations of the genomic and interactomic networks, followed by specific phenotypic transformations at the level of organism and the variable biogroupoids associated with the evolution of species which are essential to the survival of the species. The theoretical framework introduced in this article also paves the way to a Quantitative Biology approach to biological evolution at the quantum-molecular, as well as at the organismal and species levels.

Neural tissue arrested differentiation that induces cell proliferation during perturbed development and Carcinogenesis are complex processes that involve dynamically inter-connected biomolecules in the intercellular, membrane, cytosolic, nuclear and nucleolar compartments. Such \u2018dynamically inter-connected\u2019 biomolecules form numerous inter-related pathways referred to as \u2018molecular networks\u2019. One such family of signaling pathways contains the cell cyclins. Cyclins are proteins that link several critical pro-apoptotic and other cell cycling/division components, including the tumor suppressor gene TP53 and its product, the Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen (T antigen), Rb, mdm2, c-Myc, p21, p27, Bax, Bad and Bcl-2, which play major roles in various neoplastic transformations of many tissues.

[u'Mechanistic mechanisms of competition and biodiversity ', ['Lev V. Kalmykov', 'Vyacheslav L.

To investigate mechanisms of interspecific competition and their contribution in biodiversity as closely as possible we offer a white-box modelling method based on physically interpreted ecological axioms. These models are implemented as deterministic individual-based cellular automata and able to give a direct physico-mechanistic insight into studied phenomena. Competition of two trophically identical but fitness different species, competing for one limiting resource in one stable uniform habitat (which is closed for immigration, emigration, predation, herbivory and parasitism) has been investigated in conditions, which are the most unfavourable for their coexistence. The species are per capita identical in fecundity, ontogeny, regeneration features of microhabitats, and in habitat requirements. We have modelled following 8 mechanistic mechanisms of interspecific competition: 1. A case of the competitive exclusion when competing species differ only in fitness.  2. Coexistence based on periodic dominance changeovers as a consequence of environmental changes. Competing species differ only in fitness. 3. A strong violation of the competitive exclusion principle due to the lowered fecundity of both competitors. Competing species differ only in fitness.4. Coexistence based on the competition\u2013colonisation trade-off when greater fitness is compensated by r-strategy.5. A competition\u2013colonisation trade-off based on differences in ontogeny. 6. Competitive exclusion when recessive species drives out the dominant one having four times greater fecundity than the dominant one in stable environment (the greater fitness cannot compensate r-strategy). 7. An inverted competitive exclusion when recessive species drives out the dominant one by strategy of anticipatory deprivation of resources for competitor\u2019s offsprings propagation. Recessive species drives out the dominant one in stable environment and both competing species have identical fecundity (tripod neighbourhood). Paradoxically, but the greater fitness cannot save the dominant species when the all other parameters of the species are equal.8. Both competing species die because the regeneration of a limiting environmental resource takes too much time and they cannot propagate. The revealed mechanisms of competition can be useful not only in conservation biology, but also in economics and politics. Additionally, we speculate that the simplest way to maintain biodiversity is a controlled reduction of human fertility as the decrease in biodiversity occurs largely due to humankind overloading of biosphere resources.

Here we show such a two-species competition model that unifies (i) a mechanistic niche model, (ii) a mechanistic neutral (null) model and (iii) a mechanistic violation of the competitive exclusion principle. Our model is an individual-based cellular automaton. We demonstrate how two trophically identical and aggressively propagating species can stably coexist in one stable homogeneous habitat without any trade-offs in spite of their 10% difference in fitness. Competitive exclusion occurs if the fitness difference is significant (approximately more than 30%). If the species have one and the same fitness they stably coexist and have similar numbers.

Moreover, RNA-seq enables unbiased comparative analysis of expression levels across species.

[u'Structural Analysis of Outer Membrane Beta-stranded Porins using Temperature Factor', ['Abhishek Kumar'], u'2012-03-23', u'Computational and statistical analysis has formed a large component of the biophysical efforts put forth to understand protein structure and function, due to the diversity and complexity of their structure. Outer membrane proteins form a diverse and complex set of proteins. Of these, porins which allow passage of molecules across the membrane interface have been analyzed here from a biophysical and structural perspective. The objective of this study is to analyze the structural organization of porins using atomic temperature factor as a parameter. Generally atomic temperature factors of molecules from crystal structures indicate the degree of mobility or disorder seen in the crystal structure. As good crystal structures have fewer possibilities of errors so there is less chance that errors are playing roles in temperature factors. Structures of six porins (four 16 stranded beta barrel porins and two 8 stranded beta barrel porins) were taken from the PDB for the analysis based on resolution and R-factor. Programs and scripts were written for extracting the temperature factors for the beta strands, loops and turns so that the analysis could be done for different atom-types and residue-types. The residue distribution and mobility distribution was found to be characteristic of each of the porins. The mobility and residue distribution amongst the secondary structural elements were found to follow the level of homology at the sequence and structural level. The loops that had defined functional roles in structural terms were found to have lower temperature factors than the other loops. The turn regions that are thought to face the periplasmic region in the cell, showed higher temperature factors. For both the 16 stranded and the 8 stranded barrels it was found one part of the barrel (the lower wall or \u2018inner\u2019 wall comprising the trimer interface in the case of the 16 stranded barrels) was more rigid and the other half of the barrel (the higher or \u2018outer\u2019 wall) showed more mobility as seen from the temperature factors.

In the case of human TF-TG interactions, there is no database at present that explicitly provides such information even though many databases containing human TF-TG interaction data have been available. In an effort to provide researchers with a repository of TF-TG interactions from which such interactions can be directly extracted, we present here the Human Transcriptional Regulation Interactions database (HTRIdb).Description: The HTRIdb is an open-access database of experimentally validated interactions among human TFs and their TGs. HTRIdb can be searched via a user-friendly web interface and the retrieved TF-TG interactions data and the associated protein-protein interactions can be downloaded or interactively visualized as a network using the Cytoscape Web software. Moreover, users can improve the database quality by uploading their own interactions and indicating inconsistencies in the data. So far, HTRIdb has been populated with 283 TFs that regulate 11886 genes, totaling 18160 TF-TG interactions.

Recently, it is suggested that these diseases may be caused by epistatic interactions of multiple genetic variations. Although tens of software tools have been developed for epistasis detection, few are able to infer pathway importance from the identified epistatic interactions. AntEpiSeeker is originally an algorithm for detecting epistatic interactions in case-control studies, using a two-stage ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm. We have developed AntEpiSeeker2.0, which extends the AntEpiSeeker algorithm to inference of epistasis-associated pathways, based on a natural use of the ACO pheromones. By looking at pheromone distribution across pathways, epistasis-associated pathways can be easily identified. The effectiveness of AntEpiSeeker2.0 in inferring epistasis-associated pathways is demonstrated through a simulation study and a real data application.

[u'Schizophrenia is a TH2 dominant autoimmune disease possibly against acetylcholine receptors of CNS', ['Wanchung(Wan-Jiung) Hu'], u'2012-03-11', u'Schizophrenia is a very common psychiatric disorder. However, its etiology and pathogenesis is still unknown. Current theory saying that neurotransmitter imbalance such as serotonin or dopamine only provides limited effectiveness in schizophrenia treatment by drugs changing serotonin and dopamine concentration. Despite of such treatment, majority of schizophrenia patients still have very poor prognosis. Thus, the neurotransmitter imbalance theory is not correct. Here, I propose that schizophrenia is actually a TH2 dominant autoimmune disorder. The candidate of autoantigen could be acetylcholine receptors of CNS. My theory can explain the positive as well as negative symptoms of schizophrenia. By microarray analysis of PBMCS, one-tenth of the total 519 significantly expressed genes are immune-related genes. Among them, TH2 related genes are significantly up-regulated including IL-4, histidine decarboxylase, aldehyde dehydrogenase, CCR9, IgE Fc receptor, GATA2, serotonin receptor, phospholipase A2, and prostaglandin D2 synthase. Besides, TH1 and TH17 related genes are down-regulated including CXCL5, cathepsin C, and neutrophil related S100 binding proteins.

Based on divergence of evolutionary model, a sequence of human ORs database has been proposed by D. Lancet et al (2000, 2006).  It is quite impossible to infer whether a given sequence of nucleotides is a human OR or not, without any biological experimental validation. In our perspective, a proper quantitative understanding of these ORs is required to justify or nullify whether a given sequence is a human OR or not. In this paper, all human OR sequences have been quantified, and a set of clusters have been made using the quantitative results based on two different metrics. Using this proposed quantitative model, one can easily make probable justification or deterministic nullification whether a given sequence of nucleotides is a probable human OR homologue or not, without seeking any biological experiment. Of course a further biological experiment is essential to validate the probable human OR homologue.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/6967/version/2', [u'Genetics & Genomics', u'Bioinformatics'], [u'Applied Statistics Unit, Indian Statistical Instutute, Calcutta, India']]

[u'Inference of population splits and mixtures from genome-wide allele frequency data', ['Joseph K. Pickrell', 'Jonathan K.

Inferring these relationships from genetic data, however, remains a challenging task. In this paper, we present a statistical model for inferring the patterns of population splits and mixtures in multiple populations. In this model, the sampled populations in a species are related to their common ancestor through a graph of ancestral populations. Using genome-wide allele frequency data and a Gaussian approximation to genetic drift, we infer the structure of this graph. We applied this method to a set of 55 human populations and a set of 82 dog breeds and wild canids. In both species, we show that a simple bifurcating tree does not fully describe the data; in contrast, we infer many migration events. While some of the migration events that we find have been detected previously, many have not. For example, in the human data we infer that Cambodians trace approximately 16% of their ancestry to a population ancestral to other extant East Asian populations. In the dog data, we infer that both the boxer and basenji trace a considerable fraction of their ancestry (9% and 25%, respectively) to wolves subsequent to domestication, and that East Asian toy breeds (the Shih Tzu and the Pekingese) result from admixture between modern toy breeds and ``ancient\u201d Asian breeds.

Many of the current studies are focused over how mature miRNAs regulate mRNAs, even though there is very limited knowledge about their transcriptional loci. Primary miRNAs (pri-miRs) are first transcribed from the DNA, followed by the formation of precursor miRNA (pre-miR) by endonucleases activity, which finally produces mature miRNAs. Unfortunately, the identification of the loci of pri-miRs, and the associated information about transcription start sites (TSSs) and promoters is still in progress.

Some of the strongest available evidence for coevolution comes from phylogenetic codivergence, the parallel divergence of ecologically associated lineages. Early evolutionary reconstructions suggested codivergence between mimetic populations of H. erato and H. melpomene, and this was initially hailed as the most striking known case of coevolution. However, subsequent molecular phylogenetic analyses found discrepancies in phylogenetic branching patterns and timing (topological and temporal incongruence) that argued against codivergence. We present the first explicit cophylogenetic test of codivergence between mimetic populations of H. erato and H. melpomene, and re-examine the timing of these radiations. We find statistically significant topological congruence between multilocus coalescent population phylogenies of H. erato and H. melpomene, supporting repeated codivergence of mimetic populations. Divergence time estimates, based on a Bayesian coalescent model, suggest that the evolutionary radiations of H. erato and H. melpomene occurred over the same time period, and are compatible with a series of temporally congruent codivergence events.

These data were then used to create standard curves to allow quantification of COC/BE in biological samples. MIR quantification of COC and BE proved to be a sensitive, economical, and faster alternative to more costly methods, such as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, tandem mass spectrometry, or high pressure liquid chromatography.

One common feature is that the correlation values at distances that are multiples of three is higher than correlation values at other distances. Because of this such a correlation plot can be divided into two or three curves with different scalings. P. falciparum has a rare correlation property which is probably unique. I have analyzed genomes of many bacteria, fungi and protozoa and found that P. falciparum is the only organism whose DNA sequence correlation plot can be divided into four curves with different scalings.

In order to achieve this and to come to some law to which living systems obey, data obtained on cells, tissues and organs should be integrated. Because there are no such laws yet, there is usually a long path for physiological findings obtained by reductionist approaches to be translated into medical practice. The concept and accompanying equations of homeostasis presented here are aimed to develop biological laws and to bridge this gap between physiology and medicine. The concept of homeostasis takes into account energy input and output, enlisting all relevant contributors. In homeostasis, changes in the input should equal changes in the output within any specific period of time. What I suggest here is that if the system is out of homeostasis, the homeostasis may be regained by changing any of the input or output components in a proper manner, not only the one that has been changed first. It is important to note that the concept is primary addressing adult human physiology. Proposed equation should enable for the new lab findings regarding any pathophysiological conditions to find a more direct use in medicine.

For all human chromosomes, a significant correlation exists between binding of chromosomal loci to nuclear lamina and segregation into spatially-defined distinct compartments of genome-wide chromatin interactions identified by Hi-C method. We report identification of near-centromeric intergenic regions on human chromosomes (chr2; chr10; chr17; chr1), which are highly enriched for interphase chromatin homing sites and function as attractors of long-range physical interactions (Centromeric Regions of Interphase Chromatin Homing, CENTRICH). CENTRICH are engaged in 397-1526 pair-wise interactions per 1 Kb distance, which represents 199 \u2013 716-fold enrichment of interphase chromatin homing sites compared to genome-wide average (2-tail Fisher&apos;s exact test p values range 2.10E-101 \u2013 1.08E-292). CENTRICH represent unique for human highly homologous DNA sequences of 3.9 \u2013 22.4 Kb in size which are: 1) associated with nucleolus; 2) exhibit remarkably diverse regulatory protein contexts of chromatin state maps; 3) bind multiple intergenic disease-associated genomic loci (IDAGL) with documented long-range enhancer activities and established links to increased risk of developing epithelial malignancies and other common human disorders. For cancer, coronary artery disease, and type 2 diabetes, there is a statistically significant inverse correlation between the genome-wide association studies (GWAS)-defined odds ratios of increased risk of a disease and distances of SNP loci homing sites to the middle-point genomic coordinates of CENTRICH. We conclude that interactions with nucleolus and nuclear lamina may have a physiologically and pathologically significant global impact on 3D genome architecture by governing a dynamic transition of large segments of interphase human chromosomes from the open loop to folded fractal globule conformations.

Which factors contribute then to modulate this coupling? Transcription re-initiation is generally associated with coupling and this is commonly related to strong chromatin regulation. We alternatively show how strong regulation can however lead to plasticity uncorrelated to noise. The character of the regulation is also relevant, with plastic but noiseless genes usually subjected to broad expression activation whereas plastic and noisy genes experience targeted repression. This differential action is similarly noticed in how histones influence these genes. In contrast, we find that translational mechanisms are the ones separating noise from plasticity in low-plastic genes, a pattern associated with the simplicity of their expression regulation. Neighboring genome architecture as modifier appears then only effective in highly plastic genes. This poses ultimately an interesting paradox between intergenic distances and modulation, with short intergenic distances both associated and not associated with noise at different plasticity levels. Balancing the coupling among different types of expression variability appears thus as a potential shaping force of genome architecture and regulation.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/6729/version/1', [u'Genetics & Genomics', u'Molecular Cell Biology', u'Bioinformatics', u'Evolutionary Biology'], [u'Logic of Genomic Systems Laboratory, CNB-CSIC']]

World over, more than 270-300 million people are estimated to be infected with the virus. HCV is a positive sense single stranded RNA virus and replicates within the cytoplasm of the hepatocyte using its own RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). RdRp does not have proof reading capacity, and hence generates mutants of the virus, resulting in a chronic infection, which ultimately ends in hepatocellular carcinoma.  Such mutations have given rise to several genotypes, subtypes, strains and variants with significant difference in disease outcomes.  The mutation rate varies among genotypes, subtypes, strains or even in different sites of the genome. Yet, the extent of heterogeneity is usually moderate, so that estimates of the time of divergence can be computed.  The evolution of variants seems to be influenced by the genetic make-up and the immune response of the host and has geographical significance.  Here we used phylogenetic analysis and Computational molecular dating techniques to conclude that the ancestral genotype is 7a and that it originated in Canada 363 years ago.  Molecular dating was based on the fact that the rate of mutation across all evolutionary lineages is constant over time.  Surprisingly, our analyses show that genotype 1d isolated from Canada5 is the most recent with an evolutionary date of just 33 years.  It is evident that HCV is still an emerging virus and demographical parameters seem to have a very strong influence in its evolution.

[u'Amino acid features: a missing compartment of prediction of protein function', ['Esmaeil Ebrahimie', 'Mansour  Ebrahimi', 'Mahdi  Ebrahimi'], u'2011-12-13', u'Enormous computational efforts have been carried out to predict structure and function of protein. However, nearly all of these efforts have been focused on prediction of function based on primary nucleic acid sequence or modeling 3D structure of protein from its nucleic acid sequence. In fact, it seems that amino acid attributes, which is an intermediate phase between DNA/RNA and advanced protein structure, has been missed.From 2010, we examined the possibility of precise prediction of structural protein function based on amino acid features by improving the following three aspects of amino acid research: (1) Increasing the number of computationally calculated amino acid features, (2) Testing different feature selection (attribute weighting) algorithms and selection of the most important amino acid attributes based on the overall conclusion of algorithms, (3) Examining different supervised and unsupervised data mining (machine learning) algorithms, and (4) Joining attribute weighting with different data mining algorithms. We applied the discovered procedure in different biological examples including: protein thermostability, halostability, prediction of function of heavy metal transporters, cancer diagnosis and prediction, and pursuing the EST-SSRs in amino acid level.In thermostability study, we successfully established an accurate expert system to predict the thermostability of any input sequence trough mining of its calculated amino acid features. Interestingly, performance of a clustering algorithm such as EMC can vary from 0.0% to 100%, depending upon which attribute weighting algorithm had summarized the attributes of the dataset prior to running the clustering algorithm. In another recent study on halostability, the results showed that amino acid composition can be used to efficiently discriminate halostable protein groups with up to 98% accuracy implying the possibility of precise prediction of halostability when an appropriate machine learning algorithm mines a large number of structural amino acid attributes of primary protein structure.Using our approach, simple amino acid features, without the need of advanced features of protein structure, could explain the difference between P1B-ATPases in hyperaccumulator and nonhyperaccumulator plants. More importantly, a precise model was built to discriminate P1B-ATPases in different organisms based on their structural amino acid features. In addition, for the first time, reliable models for prediction of the hyperaccumulating activity of unknown P1B-ATPase pumps were developed.We employed our method in monitoring and prediction of breast cancer. The results confirmed that amino acid composition can be used to discriminate between protein groups expressed in two forms of breast cancer: malignant and benign. This study was strong evidence that malignancy can be predicted out from amino acid, and malignant proteins can be distinguished based on the amino acid composition of their proteomes without further need for protein separation. An important outcome was the discovery of the role of dipeptides, in particular Ile-Ile, in cancer progression. In addition, Generalized Rule Induction (GRI) found association rules in the data showing the 100 most important rules classifying benign, malignant, and commonly expressed proteins expressed in breast cancers.In another investigation, we found that EST-SSRs in normal lung tissues are different than in unhealthy tissues, and tagged ESTs with SSRs cause remarkable differences in amino acid and protein expression patterns in cancerous tissue. This can be supposed as a glimpse of invention of a new sort of biomarkers based on frequency of amino acids. Up to now, phylogenic trees, drawn by nucleic acid or amino acid sequence alignments, have been employed as the base of evolutionary studies. However, this method does not take into account the structural and functional features of sequences during evolution. On the contrary, the presented classification here, based on the decision tree, anomaly detection model and feature weighting, provides an evolutionary separation of organisms based on their structural reasons of this diversity.Our findings have the potential to be efficiently used in the following area:  filling the gap between laboratory engineering of proteins and computational biology, developing amino acid feature based-biomarkers, increasing the accuracy of prediction of 3D protein structure based on important amino acid features, and developing websites/software for prediction of the results of mutation.

The analysis of their texture provides so-called spot-clusters of co-expressed genes which require subsequent significance filtering and functional interpretation. We address feature selection in terms of the gene ranking problem and the interpretation of the obtained spot-related lists using concepts of molecular function.Results: Different expression scores based either on simple fold change-measures or on regularized Students t-statistics are applied to spot-related gene lists and compared with special emphasis on the error characteristics of microarray expression data. The spot-clusters are analyzed using different methods of gene set enrichment analysis with the focus on overexpression and/or overrepresentation of predefined sets of genes. Metagene-related overrepresentation of selected gene sets was mapped into the SOM images to assign gene function to different regions. Alternatively we estimated set-related overexpression profiles over all samples studied using a gene set enrichment score. It was also applied to the spot-clusters to generate lists of enriched gene sets. We used the tissue body index data set, a collection of expression data of human tissues, as an illustrative example. We found that tissue related spots typically contain enriched populations of gene sets well corresponding to molecular processes in the respective tissues. In addition, we display special sets of housekeeping and of consistently weak and highly expressed genes using SOM data filtering.

[u'Design of RNAi reagents for invertebrate model organisms and human disease vectors', ['Thomas Horn', 'Michael Boutros'], u'2011-12-04', u'RNAi has become an important tool to silence gene expression in a variety of organisms, in particular when classical genetic methods are missing. However, application of this method in functional studies has raised new challenges in the design of RNAi reagents in order to minimize false positive and false negative results. Since the performance of reagents can be rarely validated on a genome-wide scale, improved computational methods are required that consider experimentally derived design parameters. Here, we describe computational methods for the design of RNAi reagents for invertebrate model organisms and human disease vectors, such as Anopheles. We describe procedures on how to design short and long double-stranded RNAs for single genes, and evaluate their predicted specificity and efficiency. Using a bioinformatics pipeline we also describe how to design a genome-wide RNAi library for Anopheles gambiae.

The architecture of the proposed network is based on the organisation and functioning of the outer plexiform layer (OPL) in the vertebrate retina. We demonstrate that memristive devices are indeed a valuable building block for neuromorphic architectures, as their highly non-linear and adaptive response could be exploited for establishing ultra-dense networks with similar dynamics to their biological counterparts. We particularly show that hexagonal memristive grids can be employed for faithfully emulating the smoothing-effect occurring at the OPL for enhancing the dynamic range of the system. In addition, we employ a memristor-based thresholding scheme for detecting the edges of grayscale images, while the proposed system is also evaluated for its adaptation and fault tolerance capacity against different light or noise conditions as well as distinct device yields.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/6664/version/1', [u'Neuroscience', u'Bioinformatics'], [u'Interdisciplinary Technical Sciences Doctoral School, P\xe1zm\xe1ny P\xe9ter Catholic University', u'Centre for Bio-inspired Technology, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London']]

The resulting networks are far from being random and their topological properties are a consequence of the underlying mechanisms for genome evolution. Considering data on protein-protein association networks from STRING database, we present experimental evidence that degree distribution is not scale free, presenting an increased probability for high degree nodes. We also show that the degree distribution approaches a scale invariant state as the number of genes in the network increases, although real genomes still present finite size effects. Based on the experimental evidence unveiled by these data analyses, we propose a simulation model for genome evolution, where genes in a network are either acquired de novo using a preferential attachment rule, or duplicated, with a duplication probability that linearly grows with gene degree and decreases with its clustering coefficient. The results show that topological distributions are better described than in previous genome evolution models. This model correctly predicts that, in order to produce protein-protein association networks with number of links and number of nodes in the observed range, it is necessary 90% of gene duplication and 10% of de novo gene acquisition.

These MHC class\u2013II peptides are predominantly recognized by CD4+ T-helper cells, which when turned on, have profound immune regulatory effects. Thus, prediction of such MHC class-II binding peptides is very helpful towards epitope-based vaccine design. HLA-DR proteins were found to be associated with autoimmune diseases e.g. HLA-DRB1*0401 with rheumatoid arthritis. It is important for the treatment of autoimmune diseases to determine which peptides bind to MHC class II molecules. The experimental methods for identification of these peptides are both time consuming and cost intensive.

A detailed account is also presented of our high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (HR-NMR) and near infrared (NIR) calibration models, methodologies and validation procedures, together with a large number of composition analyses for soybean seeds. NIR calibrations were developed based on both HR-NMR and analytical chemistry reference data for oil and twelve amino acid residues in mature soybeans and soybean embryos. Moreover, this is our first detailed report of HR-NMR determinations of amino acid profiles of proteins from whole soybean seeds, without protein extraction from the seed.  It was found that the best results for both oil and protein calibrations were obtained with a Partial Least Squares Regression (PLS-1) analysis of our extensive NIR spectral data, acquired with either a DA7000 Dual Diode Array (Si and InGaAs detectors) instrument or with several Fourier Transform NIR (FT-NIR) spectrometers equipped with an integrating sphere/InGaAs detector accessory.  In order to extend the bulk soybean samples calibration models to the analysis of single soybean seeds, we have analized in detail the component NIR spectra of all major soybean constituents through spectral deconvolutions for bulk, single and powdered soybean seeds. Baseline variations and light scattering effects in the NIR spectra were corrected, respectively, by calculating the first-order derivatives of the spectra and the Multiplicative Scattering Correction (MSC). The single soybean seed NIR spectra are broadly similar to those of bulk whole soybeans, with the exception of minor peaks in single soybean NIR spectra in the region from 950 to 1,000 nm. Based on previous experience with bulk soybean NIR calibrations, the PLS-1 calibration model was selected for protein, oil and moisture calibrations that we developed for single soybean seed analysis. In order to improve the reliability and robustness of our calibrations with the PLS-1 model we employed standard samples with a wide range of soybean constituent compositions: from 34% to 55% for protein, from 11% to 22% for oil and from 2% to 16% for moisture. Such calibrations are characterized by low standard errors and high degrees of correlation for all major soybean constituents. Morever, we obtained highly resolved NIR chemical images for selected regions of mature soybean embryos that allow for the quantitation of oil and protein components. Recent developments in high-resolution FT-NIR microspectroscopy extend the NIR sensitivity range to the picogram level, with submicron spatial resolution in the component distribution throughout intact soybean seeds and embryos. Such developments are potentially important for biotechnology applications that require rapid and ultra- sensitive analyses, such as those concerned with high-content microarrays in Genomics and Proteomics research.

The complexity and inter-related nature of biological data poses a difficult challenge for data and tool integration.  There has been a proliferation of interoperability standards and projects over the past decade, none of which has been widely adopted by the bioinformatics  community.  Recent attempts have focused on the use of semantics to assist integration, and Semantic Web technologies are being welcomed by this community.Description. SADI \u2013 Semantic Automated Discovery and Integration \u2013 is a lightweight set of fully standards-compliant Semantic Web service design patterns that simplify the publication of services of the type commonly found in bioinformatics and other scientific domains.  Using Semantic Web technologies at every level of the Web services \u201cstack\u201d, SADI services consume and produce instances of OWL Classes following a small number of very straightforward best-practices.  In addition, we provide codebases that support these best-practices, and plug-in tools to popular developer and client software that dramatically simplify deployment of services by providers, and the discovery and utilization of those services by their consumers.Conclusions.SADI Services are fully compliant with, and utilize only foundational Web standards; are simple to create and maintain for service providers; and can be discovered and utilized in a very intuitive way by biologist end-users.  In addition, the SADI design patterns significantly improve the ability of software to automatically discover appropriate services based on user-needs, and automatically chain these into complex analytical workflows. We show that, when resources are exposed through SADI, data compliant with a given ontological model can be automatically gathered, or generated, from these distributed, non-coordinating resources \u2013 a behavior we have not observed in any other Semantic system.  Finally, we show that, using SADI, data dynamically generated from Web services can be explored in a manner very similar to data housed in static triple-stores, thus facilitating the intersection of Web services and Semantic Web technologies.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/6550/version/1', [u'Bioinformatics', u'Data Standards'], [u'Department of Medical Genetics, Heart + Lung Institute at St. Paul\u2019s Hospital, University of British Columbia']]

The expression levels of the co-expressed genes vary in a continuous and coordinate manner across the samples, ranging from absence of expression to strong co-expression of all genes. These data suggest that tumor cells may pass through an EMT like process of mesenchymal transition to varying degrees.  FindingsHere we show that this signature in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is associated with time to recurrence following initial treatment. By analyzing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we found that GBM patients who responded to therapy and had long time to recurrence had low levels of the signature in their tumor samples (P = 3\xd710-7). We also found that the signature is strongly correlated in gliomas with the putative stem cell marker CD44, and is highly enriched among the differentially expressed genes in glioblastomas vs. lower grade gliomas.

[u'Transcriptional memory emerges from cooperative histone modifications', ['Hans Binder', 'Lydia Steiner', 'Thimo Rohlf', 'Sonja Prohaska', 'Joerg Galle'], u'2011-10-07', u'BackgroundTranscriptional regulation in cells makes use of diverse mechanisms to ensure that functional states can be maintained and adapted to variable environments; among them are chromatin-related mechanisms. While mathematical models of transcription factor networks controlling development are well established, models of transcriptional regulation by chromatin states are rather rare despite they appear to be a powerful regulatory mechanism.ResultsWe here introduce a mathematical model of transcriptional regulation governed by histone modifications. This model describes binding of protein complexes to chromatin which are capable of reading and writing histone marks. Molecular interactions between these complexes and DNA or histones create a regulatory switch of transcriptional activity possessing a regulatory memory. The regulatory states of the switch depend on the activity of histone (de-) methylases, the structure of the DNA-binding regions of the complexes, and the number of histones contributing to binding. We apply our model to transcriptional regulation by trithorax- and polycomb- complex binding. By analyzing data on pluripotent and lineage-committed cells we verify basic model assumptions and provide evidence for a positive effect of the length of the modified regions on the stability of the induced regulatory states and thus on the transcriptional memory.ConclusionsOur results provide new insights into epigenetic modes of transcriptional regulation. Moreover, they implicate well-founded hypotheses on cooperative histone modifications, proliferation induced epigenetic changes and higher order folding of chromatin which await experimental validation.

Here, to understand the temporal activation profiles of the TNF-\u03b1 regulated signaling network, we developed a dynamic computational model based on the perturbation-response approach and the law of information (signaling flux) conservation. Our simulations show that the temporal average population response of the TNF-\u03b1 stimulated transcription factors NF-\u03baB and AP-1, and 3 groups of 180 downstream gene expressions follow first-order equations. Using the model, in contrast to a well-known previous study, our model suggests that the continuous activation of the third group of genes is not mainly due to the poor rate of mRNA decay process, rather, the law of signaling flux conservation stipulates the presence of secondary signaling, such as feedback mechanism or autocrine signaling, is crucial.

Carter', 'Matthew Meyerson', 'Gad Getz'], u'2011-10-05', u'Interpretation of allelic copy measurements at polymorphic markers in cancer samples presents distinctive challenges and opportunities. Due to frequent gross chromosomal alterations occurring in cancer (aneuploidy), many genomic regions are present at homologous-allele imbalance. Within such regions, the unequal contribution of alleles at heterozygous markers allows for direct phasing of the haplotype derived from each individual parent. In addition, genome-wide estimates of homologue specific copy- ratios (HSCRs) are important for interpretation of the cancer genome in terms of fixed integral copy-numbers. We describe HAPSEG, a probabilistic method to interpret bi- allelic marker data in cancer samples. HAPSEG operates by partitioning the genome into segments of distinct copy number and modeling the four distinct genotypes in each segment. We describe general methods for fitting these models to data which are suit- able for both SNP microarrays and massively parallel sequencing data. In addition, we demonstrate a specially tailored error-model for interpretation of systematic variations arising in microarray platforms. The ability to directly determine haplotypes from cancer samples represents an opportunity to expand reference panels of phased chromosomes, which may have general interest in various population genetic applications. In addition, this property may be exploited to interrogate the relationship between germline risk and cancer phenotype with greater sensitivity than is possible using unphased genotype. Finally, we exploit the statistical dependency of phased genotypes to enable the fitting of more elaborate sample-level error-model parameters, allowing more accurate estimation of HSCRs in cancer samples.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/6494/version/1', [u'Cancer', u'Genetics & Genomics', u'Bioinformatics'], [u'Broad Institute, MIT', u'Broad Institute, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', u'Broad Institute']]

Prions can propagate from cell to cell, and from organism to organism, through cooption of other protein copies.

The original prions were derived from a misfolded form of the mammalian Prion Protein PrP. Infection by these prions causes neurodegenerative diseases. Other prions cause non-Mendelian inheritance in budding yeast, and sometimes act as diseases of yeast. We have compiled a database of >2000 prion-related sequences, called the PrionOme. The database comprises seven PrionOme classification categories: prionogenic sequences (i.e., sequences that can make prions), \u2018prionoids\u2019 (i.e., phenomena that have some prion characteristics), orthologs, paralogs, pseudogenes, prion interactors, and prion-like molecules.

Also included are original references for the PrionOme classifications, transcripts and genomic coordinates, and structural data (including comparative models). We provide database usage examples for both vertebrate and fungal prion contexts. As development of this resource is on-going, we will be very happy to receive and act on any constructive comments from peer scientists in the areas of prion biology and protein misfolding, either by email or using the feedback form provided on the PrionOme website.

Ayala', 'Simon W. Hayward', 'Alexander R. A. Anderson'], u'2011-09-09', u'BACKGROUND: Tumours are made up of a mixed population of different types of cells that include normal structures as well as ones associated with the malignancy, and there are multiple interactions between the malignant cells and the local microenvironment. These intercellular interactions, modulated by the microenvironment, effect tumour progression and represent a largely under appreciated therapeutic target. We use observations of primary tumor biology from prostate cancer to extrapolate a mathematical model: specifically; it has been observed that in prostate cancer three disparate cellular outcomes predominate: (i) the tumour remains well differentiated and clinically indolent \u2013 in this case the local stromal cells may act to restrain the growth of the cancer; (ii) early in its genesis the tumour acquires a highly malignant phenotype, growing rapidly and displacing the original stromal population (often referred to as small cell prostate cancer) \u2013 these less common aggressive tumours are relatively independent  of the local microenvironment; and, (iii) the tumour co-opts the local stroma \u2013 taking on a classic stromagenic phenotype where interactions with the local microenvironment are critical to the cancer growth. METHODS: We present an evolutionary game theoretical construct that models the influence of tumour-stroma interactions in driving these outcomes. We consider three characteristic and distinct cellular populations: stromal cells, tumour cells that are self-reliant in terms of microenvironmental factors and tumour cells that depend on the environment for resources but can also co-opt stroma. RESULTS: Using evolutionary game theory we explore a number of different scenarios that elucidate the impact of tumour-stromal interactions on the dynamics of prostate cancer growth and progression and how different treatments in the metastatic setting can affect different types of tumors.CONCLUSIONS: The tumour microenvironment plays a crucial role selecting the traits of the tumour cells that will determine prostate cancer progression.

[u'The development of a simple basal area increment model', ['Georg Erich Kindermann'], u'2011-08-30', u'In most cases forest practice in Austria use yield tables to predict the growth of their forests. Common yield tables show the increment of pure even-aged stands which are treated in a way the table developer recommends. The usage of these tables in stands which are either uneven-aged, mixed or treated in another way, may lead to inaccurate predictions. To avoid these problems, forest growth models have been developed. Until now they are not widely used in Austria. One reason may be, that most of the models need some input parameters which are usually not gathered by companies. In this work a basal area increment per hectare model has been developed which is based on the input parameters: diameter at breast height, height to diameter ratio, top height at age 100 years and a selection out of several simple competition indices (growing space, basal area of larger trees, competing basal area, crown cross sectional area, crown competition factor, d/dg, d-dg, basal area and stand density index) which are distance independent.  The model parametrization was done with seven different statistical methods (linear regression, linear mixed effect model, resistant linear regression, local polynomial regression, lazy learning model, random forest model and neural network model). By using only few input-parameters it should be possible to parametrize this model for many local areas by using inventory data sets of the specific region. The model works in pure and mixed stands of spruce and beech at the Rosaliengebirge.  The observed average diameter increment per 5 years is 18.1 mm for spruce and 21.1 mm for beech.

Through this mechanism silk fibers exploit the full potential of the nanoscale building blocks, regardless of the details of microscopic loading conditions and despite the presence of large defects.

The signature is present in the expression of all solid tumor datasets that we analyzed and includes numerous EMT markers, among them the transcription factor Slug, fibronectin, and \u03b1 SMA. Using xenograft models of human cancer cells in immunocompromised mice and profiling the harvested tumors separately with species specific probes, we found that human, but not mouse, cells express most of the genes of the signature and Slug is the only upregulated EMT-inducing transcription factor. Taken together with the presence of the signature in many publicly available datasets, our results suggest that this Slug based EMT signature is produced by the cancer cells themselves in multiple cancer types, including even nonepithelial cancers such as neuroblastoma. Furthermore, we found that the presence of the signature in human xenografted cells was associated with a downregulation of adipocyte markers in the mouse tissue adjacent to the invasive tumor, suggesting contextual microenvironmental interactions when the cancer cells encounter adipocytes, as previously reported.

To investigate the binding of 11-deoxycortisol to the CR, we constructed 3D models of lamprey CR complexed with 11-deoxycortisol and deoxycorticosterone.  These 3D models reveal that Leu-220 and Met-299 in lamprey CR have contacts with the 17\u03b1-hydroxyl on 11-deoxycortisol.  Lamprey CR is the ancestor of the mineralocorticoid receptor [MR] and glucocorticoid receptor [GR].  Unlike human MR and human GR, the 3D model of lamprey CR finds a van der Waals contact between Cys-227 in helix 3 and Met-264 in helix 5.  Mutant human MR and GR containing a van der Waals contact between helix 3 and helix 5 display enhanced responses to progesterone and glucocorticoids, respectively.

Faced with this global threat it is crucial to better understand the physiology of the causative organism, Mycobacterium Tuberculosis, in order to develop efficient therapeutic strategies. PKnB from Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a crucial receptor-like protein kinase involved in signal transduction. M. tuberculosis PKnB is a trans-membrane Ser/Thr protein kinase (STPK) highly conserved in Gram-positive bacteria and apparently essential for Mycobacterial viability. We have attempted with the help of virtual screening and docking approaches to expound the extent of specificity of protein kinase B towards different classes of Thiadiazoles (an anti-tubercular agent).  The selected Thiadiazoles were selected on the basis of the structural specificity to the enzyme towards its substrate and inhibitors. Total number of Thiadiazoles were 5000 in number with the minimum binding energy of -10.46 kcal/mol with 10 molecules showing hydrogen bonds with the active site residue. The protein kinase B peptide contains two types of structural elements (Valine 95, Arginine 97) and the basic residue ring consisted of glycine rich residues. The structure of the protein-ligand complex reveals that Thiadiazoles partially occupies the adenine-binding pocket in PKnB, providing a framework for the design of compounds with potential therapeutic applications.

We \ufb01nd that the mapping performance is the same for CASAVA1.8 and the academic pipeline, resulting in a mean coverage of about 22.

Here we present the experimental and clinical evidence revealing important role of IDAGL in human diseases. Targeted RT-PCR screen coupled with sequencing of purified PCR products detects widespread transcription at multiple intergenic disease-associated genomic loci (IDAGL) and identifies 96 small non-coding trans-regulatory RNAs of ~ 100-300 nt in length containing SNPs associated with 21 common human disorders (snpRNAs). Functionality of snpRNAs is supported by multiple independent lines of experimental evidence demonstrating their cell-type-specific expression and evolutionary conservation of sequences, genomic coordinates, and biological effects. Analysis of chromatin state signatures, expression profiling experiments using microarray and Q-PCR technologies, and luciferase reporter assays indicate that many IDAGL are Polycomb-regulated long-range enhancers. Expression of snpRNAs in human and mouse cells markedly affects cellular behavior and induces allele-specific clinically-relevant phenotypic changes: NLRP1-locus snpRNAs exert regulatory effects on monocyte/macrophage trans-differentiation, induce prostate cancer (PC) susceptibility snpRNAs, and transform low-malignancy hormone-dependent human PC cells into highly malignant androgen-independent PC. Q-PCR analysis and luciferase reporter assays demonstrate that snpRNA sequences represent allele-specific \u201cdecoy\u201d targets of microRNAs which function as SNP-allele-specific modifiers of microRNA expression and activity. We demonstrate that trans-acting RNA molecules facilitating androgen depletion-independent growth (ADIG) in vitro and castration-resistant (CR) phenotype in vivo of PC contain intergenic 8q24-locus SNP variants which were recently linked with increased risk of developing PC. Expression level of 8q24-locus PC susceptibility snpRNAs is regulated by NLRP1-locus snpRNAs, which are transcribed from the intergenic long-range enhancer sequence located in 17p13 region at ~ 30 kb distance from the NLRP1 gene. Q-PCR analysis of clinical PC samples reveals markedly increased snpRNA expression levels in tumor tissues compared to the adjacent normal prostate [122-fold and 45-fold in Gleason 7 tumors (p = 0.03); 370-fold and 127-fold in Gleason 8 tumors (p = 0.0001); for NLRP1-locus and 8q24-locus SnpRNAs, respectively]. Highly concordant expression profiles of the NLRP1-locus snpRNAs and 8q24 CR-locus snpRNAs (r = 0.896; p < 0.0001) in clinical PC samples and experimental evidence of trans-regulatory effects of NLRP1-locus snpRNAs on expression of 8q24-locus SnpRNAs indicate that ADIG and CR phenotype of human PC cells can be triggered by RNA molecules transcribed from the NLRP1-locus intergenic enhancer and down-stream activation of the 8q24-locus snpRNAs. Our results define the intergenic NLRP1 and 8q24 regions as regulatory loci of ADIG and CR phenotype of human PC, reveal previously unknown molecular links between the innate immunity/inflammasome system and development of hormone-independent PC, and identify novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets exploration of which should be highly beneficial for clinical management of PC.

SOM mapping reduces the dimension of expression data from ten thousands of genes to a few thousands of metagenes where each metagene acts as representative of a minicluster of co-regulated single genes. Tissue-specific and common properties shared between groups of tissues emerge as a handful of localized spots in the tissue maps collecting groups of co-regulated and co-expressed metagenes. The functional context of the spots was discovered using overrepresentation analysis with respect to pre-defined gene sets of known functional impact. We found that tissue related spots typically contain enriched populations of gene sets well corresponding to molecular processes in the respective tissues. Analysis techniques normally used at the gene-level such as two-way hierarchical clustering provide a better signal-to-noise ratio and a better representativeness of the method if applied to the metagenes. Metagene-based clustering analyses aggregate the tissues into essentially three clusters containing nervous, immune system and the remaining tissues. Conclusions: The global view on the behavior of a few well-defined modules of correlated and differentially expressed genes is more intuitive and more informative than the separate discovery of the expression levels of hundreds or thousands of individual genes. The metagene approach is less sensitive to a priori selection of genes. It can detect a coordinated expression pattern whose components would not pass single-gene significance thresholds and it is able to extract context-dependent patterns of gene expression in complex data sets.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/5825/version/2', [u'Bioinformatics'], [u'IZBI, Uni Leipzig', u'Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research']]

The proposed approach innovates in using fuzzy logic and fuzzy set theory for evaluating the accuracy of the prognosis value in order to minimize or avoid iatrogenic injuries due to the blind needle puncture. In so doing, it demonstrates the feasibility of fuzzy analysis to contribute to medicine and health care. Fuzzy systems is employed here in synergy with artificial neural network based on backpropaga tion, multilayer perceptron architecture for building up numerical functions. Experimental data employed for analysis were collected in the accomplishment of the pneumoperitoneum in a random population of patients submitted to videolaparoscopic surgeries.

A major challenge in the analysis of such studies are hidden confounding factors, such as unobserved covariates or unknown environmental influences.  These factors can induce a pronounced artifactual correlation structure in the expression profiles, which may create spurious false associations or mask real genetic association signals.  Here, we report PANAMA (Probabilistic ANAlysis of genoMic dAta), a novel probabilistic model to account for confounding factors within aneQTL analysis. In contrast to previous methods, PANAMA learns hidden factors jointly with the effect of prominent genetic regulators.  As a result, PANAMA can more accurately distinguish between true genetic association signals and confounding variation.   We applied our model and compared it to existing methods on a variety of datasets and biological systems.  PANAMA consistently performs better than alternative methods, and finds in particular substantially more trans regulators.

Martin', 'Meromit Singer', 'Lior Pachter'], u'2011-06-01', u'A feature common to all DNA sequencing technologies is the presence of base-call errors in the sequenced reads. The implications of such errors are application specific, ranging from minor informatics nuisances to major problems affecting biological inferences. Recently developed \u201cnext-gen\u201d sequencing technologies have greatly reduced the cost of sequencing, but have been shown to be more error prone than previous technologies. Both position specific (depending on the location in the read) and sequence specific (depending on the sequence in the read) errors have been identified in Illumina and Life Technology sequencing platforms. We describe a new type of systematic error that manifests as statistically unlikely accumulations of errors at specific genome (or transcriptome) locations. We characterize and describe systematic errors using overlapping paired reads form high-coverage data. We show that such errors occur in approximately 1 in 1000 base pairs, and that quality scores at systematic error sites do not account for the extent of errors. We identify motifs that are frequent at systematic error sites, and describe a classifier that distinguishes heterozygous sites from systematic error. Our classifier is designed to accommodate data from experiments in which the allele frequencies at heterozygous sites are not necessarily 0.5 (such as in the case of RNA-Seq). Systematic errors can easily be mistaken for heterozygous sites in individuals, or for SNPs in population analyses. Systematic errors are particularly problematic in low coverage experiments, or in estimates of allele-specific expression from RNA-Seq data. Our characterization of systematic error has allowed us to develop a program, called SysCall, for identifying and correcting such errors.

Towards that goal consensus methods combining the results of several docking algorithms were developed and compared against the individual algorithms. Furthermore, a recently proposed rescoring method based on drug efficiency indices was evaluated. Among AutoDock Vina 1.0, AutoDock 4.2 and GemDock, AutoDock Vina was the best performing single method in predicting high affinity ligands from a database of known ligands and decoys. The rescoring of predicted binding energies with the water/butanol partition coeffcient did not lead to an improvement averaged over all receptor targets.

We report herein further studies based on time-course microarray analysis with a focus on malaria-induced host immunity.  Results show that in early malaria; selected immunity-related genes were up-regulated including alpha, beta, and gamma interferon related genes, as well as genes of IL-15, CD36, chemokines (CXCL10, CCL2, S100A8/9, CXCL9, and CXCL11), TRAIL and IgG Fc receptors.  During acute febrile malaria, up-regulated genes included alpha, beta, and gamma interferon related genes, IL-8, IL-1\u03b2, IL-10 downstream genes, TGFB1, oncostatin-M, chemokines, IgG Fc receptors, ADCC signaling, complement-related genes, granzymes, NK cell killer/inhibitory receptors and Fas antigen.  During remission, genes for NK receptors, immunoglobins, and granzymes/perforin were up-regulated. When viewed in terms of immunity type, malaria infection appeared to induce a mixed TH1 response, in which \u03b1 and \u03b2 interferon driven responses appear to predominate over the more classic IL-12 driven  pathway.  In addition, TH17 pathway also appears to be playing a  significant role in the immunity to Plasmodium falciparum. Gene markers of TH17 (neutrophil-related genes, TGFB1 and IL-6 family (oncostatin-M)) and TH\u03b1/\u03b2 (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and NK cytotoxicity and ADCC gene) immunity were up-regulated.

We performed further time-course microarray analysis focusing on malaria pathogenesis by using peripheral leukocytes as a cellular model. We found up-regulation of coagulation-related genes (SERPINB2, thrombomodulin, thrombospondin), heat shock proteins, glycolytic enzymes, glucose transporters, and vacuolar H+-ATPases in acute febrile malaria. In early malaria, prior to detectable parasitemia, CD36 and ICAM1 were up-regulated. During acute malaria, a correlation was observed between IL-1\xdf and  heat shock proteins, suggesting heat shock protein response may be in  the febrile response induced by IL-1\xdf. CD163, a hemoglobin scavenger receptor, was up-regulated in acute malaria to potentially facilitate free hemoglobin up-take by peripheral leukocytes. In acute malaria, high MafB gene expression was negatively correlated with down-regulation of hemoglobin and platelet counts. Consistent with a down-regulation of hemoglobin expression, peripheral RBC counts tended to increase during the acute malaria. In our model, up-regulations of RBC and/or leucocyte binding mediators like CD36, ICAM1, thrombospondin, and thrombomodulin may contribute to the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria.  Similarly, up-regulation of genes coding for glycolytic enzymes, glucose transporter and H+-ATPases may contribute to the hypoglycemia and metabolic acidosis frequently observed in seriously ill malaria patients.

We recently identified a precise gene expression signature of fibroblastic origin associated with cancer invasion, the first step of the metastatic cascade. The signature contains many coordinately overexpressed genes, prominent among which are COL11A1, THBS2 and INHBA. Here we show that there is a striking similarity between the set of expressed genes in this metastasis-associated fibroblastic (MAF) signature and the set of genes that are downregulated when fibroblasts are reprogrammed to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Because it is known that fibroblast reprogramming involves a mesenchymal epithelial transition (MET), the above facts suggest that, conversely, the metastasis-associated fibroblasts responsible for the signature may result from stem-like cells undergoing some type of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).  Therefore, we speculate that cancer stem cells (CSCs) undergoing some type of EMT become fibroblastic to obtain motility and invasiveness, reactivating early embryonic developmental pathways, and that these fibroblast-like cells are the main source of the MAF signature that we previously identified.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/5924/version/1', [u'Biotechnology', u'Cancer', u'Developmental Biology', u'Bioinformatics'], [u'Columbia University']]

[u'Scaffolder \u2013 Software for Reproducible Genome Scaffolding.', ['Michael D. Barton', 'Hazel A. Barton'], u'2011-03-14', u'Background: Assembly of short-read sequencing data can result in a fragmented non-contiguous series of genomic sequences. Therefore a common step in a genome project is to join neighboring sequence regions together and fill gaps in the assembly using additional sequences. This scaffolding step, however, is non-trivial and requires manually editing large blocks of nucleotide sequence. Joining these sequences together also hides the source of each region in the final genome sequence. Taken together, these considerations may make reproducing or editing an existing genome build difficult.Methods: The software outlined here, \u201cScaffolder,\u201d is implemented in the Ruby programming language and can be installed via the RubyGems software management system. Genome scaffolds are defined using YAML \u2013 a data format, which is both human and machine-readable. Command line binaries and extensive documentation are available.Results: This software allows a genome build to be defined in terms of the constituent sequences using a relatively simple syntax to define the scaffold. This syntax further allows unknown regions to be defined, and adds additional sequences to fill gaps in the scaffold. Defining the genome construction in a file makes the scaffolding process reproducible and easier to edit compared with FASTA nucleotide sequence.Conclusions: Scaffolder is easy-to-use genome scaffolding software. This tool promotes reproducibility and continuous development in a genome project.

Although the estrogen receptor [ER] appears to be the ancestral vertebrate steroid receptor and estradiol [E2] is the physiological ligand for vertebrate ERs, the identity of the ancestral ligand(s) for the ER remains unknown.  Here, using an analysis of crystal structures of human ER\u03b1 with E2 and other chemicals and 3D models of human ER\u03b1 with 27-hydroxycholesterol and 5-androsten-3\u03b2,17\u03b2-diol, we propose that one or more \u03945 steroids were the ancestral ligands for the ER, with E2 evolving later as the canonical estrogen.

The underrepresentation observed does not extend to the noncoding strand, suggesting that the cause of the asymmetry is related to mRNA rather than DNA. Our data do not suggest that the underrepresentation is due to gene transfer from eukaryotes. We speculate that one possible explanation for these observations is that the protein coding sequence of Thermotogae, Archaea and Bacteria was at some time in the past subjected to selection against certain motifs appearing in an order which might initiate splicing in environments harboring a functional spliceosome. This is consistent with, but certainly does not prove, a hypothetical scenario in which at least some prokaryote lineages once possessed a functional spliceosome.

[u'Word Activation Forces Map Word Networks', ['Jun Guo', 'Hanliang Guo', 'Zhanyi Wang'], u'2011-03-07', u'Words associate with each other in a manner of intricate clusters1-3. Yet the brain capably encodes the complex relations into workable networks4-7 such that the onset of a word in the brain automatically and selectively activates its associates, facilitating language understanding and generation8-10. One believes that the activation strength from one word to another forges and accounts for the latent structures of the word networks. This implies that mapping the word networks from brains to computers11,12, which is necessary for various purposes1,2,13-15, may be achieved through modeling the activation strengths. However, although a lot of investigations on word activation effects have been carried out8-10,16-20, modeling the activation strengths remains open. Consequently, huge labor is required to do the mappings11,12. Here we show that our found word activation forces, statistically defined by a formula in the same form of the universal gravitation, capture essential information on the word networks, leading to a superior approach to the mappings. The approach compatibly encodes syntactical and semantic information into sparse coding directed networks, comprehensively highlights the features of individual words. We find that based on the directed networks, sensible word clusters and hierarchies can be efficiently discovered. Our striking results strongly suggest that the word activation forces might reveal the encoding of word networks in the brain.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/5764/version/1', [u'Neuroscience', u'Bioinformatics'], [u'Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, School of Information and Communication Engineering', u'University of Southern California, Aerospace and Mechanical Department, Viterbi School of Engineering']]

Starting in June 2010, oil reached hundreds of miles of Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida shoreline disturbing the ecological balance and economic stability of the region. While visible damages are evident in the wildlife populations and marine estuaries, the most significant affect may be on the most basic level of the ecosystems: the bacterial and plankton populations.We present results from high throughput DNA sequencing of close-to-shore water and beach soil samples before and during the appearance of oil in Louisiana and Mississippi. Sixteen samples were taken over a two month period at approximately two week intervals from Grand Isle, LA and Gulfport, MS and were sequenced using the Illumina GAIIx platform.

Available bio-literature search engines vary in their ability to scan different sections of articles, for the user-provided search terms and/or phrases. Since a thorough scientific analysis of all major bibliographic tools has not been done, their selection has often remained subjective. We have considered most of the existing bio-literature search engines (http://www.shodhaka.com/startbioinfo/LitSearch.html) and performed an extensive analysis of 18 literature search engines, over a period of about 3 years. Eight different topics were taken and about 50 searches were performed using the selected search engines. The relevance of retrieved citations was carefully assessed after every search, to estimate the citation retrieval efficiency. Different other features of the search tools were also compared using a semi-quantitative method.ResultsThe study provides the first tangible comparative account of relative retrieval efficiency, input and output features, resource coverage and a few other utilities of the bio-literature search tools. The results show that using a single search tool can lead to loss of up to 75% relevant citations in some cases. Hence, use of multiple search tools is recommended. But, it would also not be practical to use all or too many search engines. The detailed observations made in the study can assist researchers and health professionals in making a more objective selection among the search engines. A corollary study revealed relative advantages and disadvantages of the full-text scanning tools.ConclusionWhile many studies have attempted to compare literature search engines, important questions remained unanswered till date.

Citation-Compiler (http://www.shodhaka.com/compiler) can help to compile the results from each of the recommended tool.b) What is the approximate percentage of relevant citations expected to be lost if only one search engine is used? ANSWER: About 39% of the total relevant citations were lost in searches across 4 topics; 49% hits were lost while using PubMed or HighWire Press, while 37% and 20% loss was noticed while using Google Scholar and Scopus, respectively. c) Which full text search engines can be recommended in general?

DNA can be thought of as a one-dimensional multi-state CA, more precisely four states of CA namely A, T, C, and G which can be taken as  numerals 0, 1, 2 and 3. Earlier, G.Ch. Sirakoulis et al reported the DNA structure, evolution and function through quaternary logic one dimensional CA and the authors have found the simulation results of DNA evolutions with the help of only four linear CA rules. The DNA sequences which are produced through the CA evolutions, however, are seen by our research team not to exist in the established databases of various genomes although the initial seed (initial global state of CA) was taken from the database. This problem motivated us to study the DNA evolutions from a more fundamental point of view.  Parallel to the CA paradigm we have devised an enriched set of discrete transformations which have been named as Integral Value Transformations (IVT). Interestingly, on applying the IVT systematically, we have been able to show that each of the DNA sequences at various discrete time instances in IVT evolutions can be directly mapped to a specific DNA sequence existing in the database. This has been possible through our efforts of getting quantitative mathematical parameters of the DNA sequences involving Fractals.

Without electrical symbolism, it is very likely that our industrial society would not have evolved at the same pace.

With the advent of Systems Biology, and more recently of Synthetic Biology, the need for precise and unambiguous descriptions of biochemical interactions has become more pressing. While some ideas have been advanced over the last decade, with a few detailed proposals, no actual community standard has emerged. The Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN) is a graphical representation crafted over several years by a community of biochemists, modellers and computer scientists. Three orthogonal and complementary languages have been created, the Process Diagrams, the Entity Relationship Diagrams and the Activity Flow Diagrams. Using these three idioms a scientist can represent any network of biochemical interactions, which can then be interpreted in an unambiguous way. The set of symbols used is limited, and the grammar quite simple, to allow its usage in textbooks and its teaching directly in high schools.

[u'Evidence of Massive Horizontal Gene Transfer Between Humans and Plasmodium vivax ', ['Daniel Z. Bar'], u'2011-02-16', u'The horizontal transfer of DNA between different organisms is a major force shaping the genomes of prokaryotes, but is considered to have a minor role in eukaryotes, with only a handful of known examples, mostly of limited size. The nucleotide databases of Plasmodium genomes were divided into small fragments and compared to human, as well as to other Plasmodium genomes.  This computational approach revealed that the Plasmodium vivax genome is interlaced with multiple DNA fragments that were likely acquired via horizontal transfer from humans. Contamination is a major concern in such studies; moreover, it must be determined if the identified homologies might be due to chance. These reservations are supported by the fact that the identified homologous sequences were found to be predominantly within short contigs. Re-sequencing of candidate sites using distinct isolations of P. vivax genomic DNA showed deletions not found in the human genome, and with much greater similarity to the P. vivax than human genome. Moreover, the identified fragments were enriched for mRNA coding sequences and genes that are known to be functionally important for P. vivax, including nitric oxide synthase 1 (neuronal) adaptor and Interleukin-1 family, suggesting a functional role. These results are important for two reasons. First, a directional massive horizontal transfer of genetic material from humans to another eukaryote is shown for the first time. This sheds light on parasite evolution, co-adaptation and immune evasion. Second, the DNA found is enriched for Interleukin-1 family, which is known to be essential for malaria protection.

[u'Large sets of edit-metric sequence identification tags to facilitate large-scale multiplexing of reads from massively parallel sequencing', ['Brant C. Faircloth', 'Travis C. Glenn'], u'2011-02-13', u'BackgroundMassively parallel DNA sequencing technologies provide exponential increases in the amount of data returned from the sequencing process, relative to traditional (Sanger-based) techniques.  Use of unique, synthetic oligonucleotides (identifying sequence tags) on each sample enables the deconvolution of samples pooled prior to massively parallel sequencing.  To counteract oligonucleotide synthesis and sequencing errors, sequence tags should be drawn from combinations with sufficient differences and with an appropriate error-correcting code over the alphabet [A,C,G,T].  This method ensures that errors within the tags do not cause sequences to be assigned to the wrong sample while also enabling correction and recovery of incorrectly-sequenced or incorrectly-synthesized tags.  The set of available tags should be large, allowing sample multiplexing to scale with rapid changes in sequencing platform output.  The set of tags should also account for errors possible during both the oligonucleotide synthesis and sequencing processes.  Most tags in current use have been designed to maintain a particular Hamming distance: a scheme that ensures the distance between tag sequences is maintained in the presence of substitutions.  However, sequence identification tags conforming to the edit-metric are more appropriate: edit-metric sequence tags are robust to insertions, deletions, and substitution errors.  ResultsWe present edittag, a python package containing several tools to facilitate the design of edit-metric-based sequence identification tags, check existing sets of sequence identification tags for conformance to the edit-metric, and apply sequence identification tags to primers and/or adapters.  We use edittag to design several large sets of edit-metric sequence tags ranging from four to 10 nucleotides in length and edit distance three to nine.  Finally, we test a set of fusion primers designed with the software developed here, demonstrating high levels of successful amplification. ConclusionsResearchers using sequence identification tags should consider using edit-metric-based sequence tags in place of the more common, Hamming-distance-based alternatives.

Little is known about the structure and function of hABH5, one of the members of this superfamily. Therefore, in the present study we intend to predict its structure and function using various bioinformatics tools. Modeling was done with modeler 9v7 to predict the 3D structure of the hABH5 protein. 3-D model of hABH5, ALKBH5.B99990005.pdb was predicted and evaluated. Validation results showed 96.8% residues in favor and an additional allowed region of the Ramachandran plot. Ligand binding residues prediction showed four ligand clusters, having 25 ligands in cluster 1. Importantly, conserved pattern of Pro158-X-Asp160-Xn-His266 in the functional domain was detected. DNA and RNA binding sites were also predicted in the model.

However, the association between the plasma amino acid profile and body fat accumulation has not been evaluated in humans.Objective: This study aimed to relate plasma amino acids to visceral fat accumulation in humans because excess visceral fat raises the odds ratio of developing metabolic syndrome.Design: A total of 1,449 subjects (985 males and 464 females) who had undergone a comprehensive health screening were enrolled in this study. The visceral fat area (VFA) was determined in each subject using CT imaging. Subjects were then divided into two groups according to VFA: high-VFA (\u2265100 cm2, n=867) and low-VFA (<100 cm2, n=582). The plasma amino acid profile was analyzed together with other metabolic valuables and then compared between the two groups using uni- and multivariate analyses. Results: As the degree of visceral fat accumulation increased, plasma concentrations of several amino acids changed significantly. Glu, Val, Leu, Ile, Tyr, Ala, Phe, Pro, Lys, Orn, Trp, Met, His and alpha-aminobutyric acid (ABA) levels were significantly higher in the high-VFA group compared to the low-VFA group, whereas the levels of Gly, Ser, Gln and Asn were significantly lower. To evaluate the potential of using amino acids as an indicator of VFA, a discriminant analysis was conducted with the multivariate logistic regression analysis "AminoIndex", and the ROC curve was calculated. The resulting "AminoIndex" exhibited an area under the ROC curve of 0.81 (95% confidence interval; 0.78 to 0.83), with higher sensitivity and specificity by 80% and 65%, respectively.Conclusions: The plasma amino acid profile changes depending on visceral fat content and can be used as a marker for diagnosing elevated visceral obesity in humans.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/5560/version/1', [u'Bioinformatics'], [u'Ajinomoto Co., Inc., Frontier Research Laboratories, Institute for Innovation', u'Center for Multiphasic Health Testing and Services, Mitsui Memorial Hospital', u'Kameda Medical Center Makuhari', u'Clinical Laboratory, Mitsui Memorial Hospital']]
[u'Targeted Assembly of Short Sequence Reads', ['Rene L. Warren', 'Robert A.

However, in situations where information is required only for specific sequence variants, it is not necessary to assemble or align whole genome data sets in their entirety.  Rather, NGS data sets can be mined for the presence of sequence variants of interest by localized assembly, which is a faster, easier, and more accurate approach. We present TASR, a streamlined assembler that interrogates very large NGS data sets for the presence of specific variants, by only considering reads within the sequence space of input target sequences provided by the user. The NGS data set is searched for reads with an exact match to all possible short words within the target sequence, and these reads are then assembled strin-gently to generate a consensus of the target and flanking sequence.  Typically, variants of a particular locus are provided as different target sequences, and the presence of the variant in the data set being interrogated is revealed by a successful assembly outcome. However, TASR can also be used to find unknown sequences that flank a given target. We demonstrate that TASR has utility in finding or confirming ge-nomic mutations, polymorphism, fusion and integration events. Targeted assembly is a powerful method for interrogating large data sets for the presence of sequence variants of interest.  TASR is a fast, flexible and easy to use tool for targeted assembly.

[u'Bioinformatics analysis of homologies between pathogen antigens, autoantigens and the CFTR cystic fibrosis protein: A role for immunoadsorption therapy?', ['Christopher Carter'], u'2010-12-02', u'The cystic fibrosis CFTR chloride channel is involved in pathogen entry into epithelial cells, and provides the glutathione and hypochlorous acid necessary for bactericidal and viricidal actions. CFTR mutations block these effects, diminishing pathogen defence and allowing pathogen accumulation in the extracellular space, where antibody encounter is likely. The pathogen antigens observed in cystic fibrosis (including P. Aeruginosa, S.Aureus and S.Maltophilia proteins) are homologous to the autoantigens reported in cystic fibrosis and all are homologous to the CFTR protein itself. Antibodies to pathogens and autoantigens may also target the CFTR protein, acting as antagonists, further compromising its function. The tripartite relationship between pathogen antigens, autoantigens and the CFTR protein creates a feed forward cycle, diminishing the function of the CFTR protein and increasing the probability of pathogen accumulation and further antibody encounters at every turn. Kegg pathway analysis of the CFTR/autoantigen interactome indicates that the CFTR protein is also involved in pathogen entry pathways, diabetes and pancreatic and gastric acid secretion pathways, in pathways related to cardiac myopathy, and in the gonadotrophin signalling network, all which are relevant to cystic fibrosis.  Interruption of this cycle by antigen and antibody adsorption, and possibly by immunosuppressant therapy may perhaps be of clinical benefit in cystic fibrosis.

Highly immunogenic B cell epitopes along its length are homologous to numerous proteins relevant to schizophrenia, including members of the DISC1 interactome, glutamate, dopamine and neuregulin signaling networks, and plasticity or myelination pathways. Antibodies to gliadin may cross react with these key proteins, as has already been observed with synapsin 1 and calreticulin. Gliadin may thus be a causative agent in schizophrenia, under certain genetic and immunological conditions, producing its effects via antibody mediated knockdown of multiple proteins relevant to the disease process. Because of such homology, an autoimmune response may be sustained by the human antigens that resemble gliadin itself, a scenario supported by many reports of immune activation both in the brain and in lymphocytes in schizophrenia.

[u'On the nucleotide distribution in bacterial DNA sequences', ['Marcelo Sobottka', 'Andrew Glenn Hart'], u'2010-11-12', u'It is probable that the distributional structure of DNA sequences arises from the accumulation of many successive stochastic events such as nucleotide deletions, insertions, substitutions and elongations [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Although the existence of long-range correlations in non-coding portions of DNA sequences is well established [8, 9, 10, 11], first order Markov chains might well capture aspects of their nucleotide distributions [12]. Here we propose a hidden Markov model based on a coupling of an urn process with a Markov chain to approximate the distributional structure of primitive DNA sequences. Then, by supposing that a bacterial DNA sequence can be derived from uniformly distributed mutations of some primitive DNA, we use the model to explain and predict some distributional properties of bacterial DNA sequences. The distributional properties intrinsic to the model were compared to statistical estimates from 1049 bacterial DNA sequences.

[u'Expanding the modern synthesis II: Formal perspectives on the inherent role of niche construction in fitness', ['Rodrick Wallace'], u'2010-11-04', u'Expanding the modern synthesis requires elevating the role of interaction within and across various biological scales to the status of an evolutionary principle. One way to do this is to characterize genes, gene expression, and embedding environment as information sources linked by crosstalk, constrained by the asymptotic limit theorems of information theory (Wallace, 2010a). This produces an inherently interactive structure that escapes the straightjacket of mathematical population genetics or other replicator dynamics. Here, we examine fitness from that larger perspective, finding it intimately intertwined with niche construction. Two complementary models are explored: niche construction as mediating the connection between environmental signals and gene expression, and as a means of tuning the channel for the transmission of genetic information in a noisy environment.

Collagen is also the dominating material in the extracellular matrix and its stiffness controls cell differentiation, growth and pathology. However, the origin of the unique mechanical properties of collagenous tissues, and in particular its stiffness, extensibility and nonlinear mechanical response remains unknown. By using x-ray diffraction data of a collagen fibril (Orgel et al., PNAS, 2006) here we present an experimentally validated model of the nanomechanics of a collagen microfibril that incorporates the full biochemical details of the amino acid sequence of constituting molecules. We demonstrate that mechanical testing of hydrated (wet) collagen microfibrils yields a Young\u2019s modulus of \u2248300 MPa at small and \u22481.2 GPa at larger deformation in excess of 10% strain, in excellent agreement with experimental data. Dehydrated (dry) collagen microfibrils show a significantly increased Young\u2019s modulus of \u22481.8-2.25 GPa owing to a much tighter molecular packing, in agreement with experimental measurements. Our results demonstrate that the unique mechanical properties of collagen microfibrils arise due to their hierarchical structure, where key deformation mechanisms are straightening of twisted molecules at small strains, followed by axial stretching and eventual molecular uncoiling. These mechanisms explain the striking difference of the modulus of collagen fibrils compared with single molecules, which is found in the range of 4.8\xb12 GPa or \u224810-20 times greater. The atomistic model of collagen microfibril mechanics enables the bottom-up elucidation of structure-property relationships in a broader class of collagen materials (e.g. tendon, bone, cornea), including studies of genetic disease where the incorporation of biochemical details is essential.

Due to their highly organized structures, amyloid proteins have also been used for the development of novel nanomaterials, for a variety of applications including biomaterials for tissue engineering, nanolectronics, or optical devices. Past research on amyloid fibrils resulted in advances in identifying their mechanical properties, revealing a remarkable stiffness. However, the failure mechanism under tensile loading has not been elucidated yet, despite its importance for the understanding of key mechanical properties of amyloid fibrils and plaques as well as the growth and aggregation of amyloids into long fibers and plaques. Here we report a molecular level analysis of failure of amyloids under uniaxial tensile loading. Our molecular modeling results demonstrate that amyloid fibrils are extremely stiff with a Young\u2019s modulus in the range of 18-30 GPa, in good agreement with previous experimental and computational findings. The most important contribution of our study is our finding that amyloid fibrils fail at relatively small strains of 2.5% to 4%, and at stress levels in the range of 1.02 to 0.64 GPa, in good agreement with experimental findings.  Notably, we find that the strength properties of amyloid fibrils are extremely length dependent, and that longer amyloid fibrils show drastically smaller failure strains and failure stresses. As a result, longer fibrils in excess of hundreds of nanometers to micrometers have a greatly enhanced propensity towards spontaneous fragmentation and failure.

Moreover, adding valuable information and functions that persuade the user to discover the interesting relations hidden within the data is, in itself, a great challenge. Also, the cumulative information can provide greater biological insight than is possible with individual information sources. Furthermore, the rapidly growing number of databases and data types poses the challenge of integrating the heterogeneous data types, especially in biology. This rapid increase in the volume and number of data resources drive for providing polymorphic views of the same data and often overlap in multiple resources.  In this thesis a multi-pronged approach is proposed that deals with various methods for the analysis and representation of the diverse biological data which are present in different data sources. This is an effort to explain and emphasize on different concepts which are developed for the analysis of molecular data and also to explain its biological significance. The hypotheses proposed are in context with various other results and findings published in the past.

This model has several attractive features: as protein chains emerge, SNTDs form spontaneously and serve as nucleation points, creating more compact shapes. This reduces the risk of protein degradation or aggregation.

Extracting meaningful information from those technologies requires careful analysis of the large volumes of data they produce. In this note, we present a set of distributions that commonly appear in the analysis of such data.

The first set of examples which we present here are drawn from a high-throughput sequencing experiment. Here, the self-similar distributions appear as part of the evaluation of the error rate of the sequencing technology and the identification of tumorogenic genomic alterations. The other examples are obtained from risk factor evaluation and analysis of relative disease prevalence and co-mordbidity  as these appear in electronic clinical data.

We applied KEREN to reconstruct gene regulatory interactions in the model bacteria E.coli on a genome-wide scale.

Whilst this may have been the best format for exchanging and sharing phylogenetic hypotheses during the 20th century, the worldwide web now provides faster and automated ways of transferring and sharing phylogenetic knowledge. However, novel software is needed to defrost these published phylogenies for the 21st century. TreeRipper is a command line c++ program for the fully-automated recognition of multifurcating phylogenetic trees. The program accepts a range of input image formats  (PNG, JPG/JPEG, GIF, TIFF or PDF ). Then follows a number of cleaning steps to detect lines, remove node labels, patch-up broken lines and corners and detect line edges. The edge contour is then determined to detect the branch length, tip label positions and the topology of the tree. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is used to convert the tip labels into text with the freely available tesseract-ocr software. 32% of images meeting the prerequisites for TreeRipper were successfully recognised, the largest tree had 115 leaves. Despite the diversity of ways phylogenies have been illustrated making the design of a fully automated tree recognition software difficult, TreeRipper is a step towards automating the digitization of past phylogenies.

Without electrical symbolism, it is very likely that our industrial society would not have evolved at the same pace. Similarly, specialised notations such as the Feynmann notation or the process flow diagrams did a lot for the adoption of concepts in their own fields. With the advent of Systems Biology, and more recently of Synthetic Biology, the need for precise and unambiguous descriptions of biochemical interactions has become more pressing. While some ideas have been advanced over the last decade, with a few detailed proposals, no actual community standard has emerged. The Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN) is a graphical representation crafted over several years by a community of biochemists, modellers and computer scientists. Three orthogonal and complementary languages have been created, the Process Descriptions, the Entity Relationships and the Activity Flows. Using these three idioms a scientist can represent any network of biochemical interactions, which can then be interpreted in an unambiguous way. The set of symbols used is limited, and the grammar quite simple, to allow its usage in textbooks and its teaching directly in high schools. The first level of the SBGN Entity Relationship language has been publicly released.

Furthermore, some experimental evidence points out that inhibition of CDK2 or Skp2 can be the critical trigger for cellular senescence. However, no mathematical model has been developed to highlight cellular senescence until now. In this study, we first implement a mathematical model of G1/S transition involving the DNA-damage pathway to highlight cellular senescence by lowering the critical trigger- CDK2. For this, we focus on the behaviour of two important proteins (E2F and CycE) for several reduced CDK2 levels under two DNA-damage conditions by calculating the probability (\u03b2) of DNA-damaged cells passing the G1/S. Our recently published results from the same model indicated that a large percentage of damaged cells pass G1/S under normal CDK2 levels, reaching \u03b2 values of up to 65% under high level of DNA damage. The current study reveals that reduced CDK2 levels can significantly lower the percentage of damaged cells passing the G1/S; in particular, 50% reduction in CDK2 achieves 65% reduction in the passage of damaged cells. Furthermore, the model analyses the relationship between CDK2 and its CKIs in search of other effective ways to bring forward cellular senescence. Results show that the degradation rate of p21 and initial concentration of p27 can be effectively used to lower the senescence threshold. Specifically, p27 is the most effective, followed by CDK2 and p21. However, the combined effect of CDK2 and CKIs is dramatic with CDK2/p27 combination almost totally arresting the passage of damaged cells.

Because most researchers in the biological sciences do not have a strong computer science background we have focused on improving the quality of existing, proven text mining systems by implementing a web-based GUI that greatly improves the workflow of these systems.

METHODS: We analyzed 2008 National Health Interview Survey for our cross-sectional analysis. All households with females aged 9 \u2013 17 years were eligible for inclusion in our analysis. Our outcomes of interest included HPV vaccine initiation (\u22651 dose) and series completion (full 3 doses). A dichotomous variable indicating a cancer-related limitation for a household member was created if at least one adult in the household responded to having a limitation caused by cancer. We used Firth\u2019s bias-reducing penalized likelihood for logistic regression11 to estimate prevalence odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% profile penalized likelihood confidence intervals (CIs) for HPV vaccine uptake among young females who had a household member with a cancer-related limitation compared to young females who did not have a household member with a cancer-related limitation after adjusting for child\u2019s age, race/ethnicity, and SES.RESULTS: HPV vaccine initiation and completion were higher among females aged 9-17 years who had a household member with a cancer-related limitation (Initiation: OR=1.42, 95%CI: 0.26, 5.18); Completion: OR=2.50, 95%CI: 0.26, 11.58).

Considerable discrepancies of transposable elements in eukaryotes have been reported; however, the studies focusing on the diversity of transposable systems in prokaryotes were scarce. Understanding the transposable element system in cyanobacteria by the genome-wide analysis will greatly improve the knowledge of cyanobacterial diversity.Results:In this study, the transposable elements of seventeen cyanobacterial genomes were analyzed. The abundance of insertion sequence (IS) elements differs significantly among the cyanobacterial genomes examined. In particular, water bloom forming Microcystis aeruginosa NIES843 was shown to have the highest abundance of IS elements reaching 10.95% of the genome. IS family is a widely acceptable IS classification unit, and IS subfamily, based on probe sequences, was firstly proposed as the basic classification unit for IS element system. Both of IS family and IS subfamily were set as the two hierarchical units for evaluating the IS element system diversity. Totally, 1982 predicted IS elements, within 21 IS families and 133 subfamilies were identified in the examined cyanobacterial genomes. Families IS4, IS5, IS630 and IS200-605 are widely distributed, and therefore supposed to be the ancestral IS families. Analysis on the intactness of IS elements showed that the percentage of the intact IS differs largely among these cyanobacterial strains. Higher percentage of the intact IS detected in the two hot spring cyanobacterial strains implied that the intactness of IS elements may be related to the genomic stabilization of cyanobacteria inhabiting in the extreme environments. The frequencies between IS elements and miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) were shown to have a linear positive correlation. Conclusions:The transposable element system in cyanobacterial genomes is of hypervariabilty. With characterization of easy definition and stability, IS subfamily is considered as a reliable classification unit in IS element system. The abundance of intact IS, the composition of IS families and subfamilies, the sequence diversity of IS element nucleotide and transposase amino acid are informative and suitable as the indicators for studies on cyanobacterial diversity.

Present sequence alignment methods are somewhat error-prone, often producing systematic bias. Errors in sequence alignments sometimes lead to subsequent misinterpretation of evolutionary, structural and functional information in genes, proteins and genomes. In traditional sequence alignment algorithms, alignments of DNA and protein sequences are conducted separately. It has been long believed that the phylogenetic signal disappears more rapidly from DNA sequences than from encoded proteins. It is therefore generally preferable to align sequences at the amino acid level. Here we present a new method\u2014DNA+Pro, which aggregates DNA and protein sequences into combined DNA-protein sequences and align them in a combined fashion. We demonstrate that combining sequences improve the quality of multiple sequence alignment and solve practical evolutionary problems in primate immunodeficiency virus proteins and bacterial restriction enzymes. In addition to increased theoretical information contents, the distance estimations are more biological significant in combined alignment than in protein only or DNA only alignments. By integrating information buried separately in DNA and protein sequences, DNA+Pro improves the accuracy of multiple sequence alignment of closely-related proteins and prevents certain errors that may occur in phylogeny analysis using protein only approaches.

Till date, correlation between X-ray crystallographic and NMR data are considered to be the best methods for determining structure of intra-cellular proteins. Generating crystals and finding correct experimental conditions for NMR are largly a gamble and resultant data processing highly time consuming. Even if, a large number of laboratories around the world and India make crystals of protein but majority of them fail to generate crystallographic data less than or equal to 10A resolution with currently available instruments. This means that X-ray crystallographic data have been generated from protein crystals with non-uniform lattices. We believe that a large portion of (chain of amino acids) all proteins, be it an intra-cellular, transmembrane or extra-cellular proteins form uniform lattices following precise deterministic mathematical rules in natural condition inside cells or membranes or in extra-cellular conditions. This hypothesis has several advantages. First, stacking of protein chains like lattices (lattices of helix or beta-sheet etc.) allows a particular protein to resist forces of compression and relaxation. Secondly, it will be easier to expose hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains following a mathematical rule described in this paper. Barstar, Barnase and olfactory receptors (ORs) have 90, 110 and ~312 amino acids respectively. Using Young-Fibonacci graph area model, here we show that all naturally available protein folding problems can be solved or a preliminary idea about their secondary and tertiary structures can be predicted. This is absolutely necessary considering the fact that there are zillions of proteins present in the animal and plant world.

Reshuffling of stretches of DNA like above within organisms has given rise to different chromosomes. Till date it is not known how this process is governed. In this paper we show that starting with a sixteen base-pair human olfactory DNA sequence one can form a highly conserved protein domain. Once this domain is formed repetitive DNA sequences of a particular kind starts generating which signifies that this particular conserved protein domain will be unique in nature.

For others noise is necessary for coping with stochasticity or for providing dice-like mechanisms to control cell fate.  But how is noise in gene expression modulated?  We hypothesise that gene orientation may be crucial, as for divergently organized gene pairs expression of one gene could affect chromatin of a neighbour thereby reducing noise. Transcription of antisense non-coding RNA from a shared promoter is similarly argued to be a noise-reduction mechanism.   Stochastic simulation models confirm the expectation.  The model correctly predicts: that protein coding genes with bi-promoter architecture, including those with a ncRNA partner, have lower noise than other genes; divergent gene pairs uniquely have correlated expression noise; distance between promoters predicts noise; ncRNA divergent transcripts are associated with genes that a priori would be under selection for low noise; essential genes reside in divergent orientation more than expected; bi-promoter pairs are rare subtelomerically, cluster together and are enriched in essential gene clusters.

[u"The human genome is composed of viral DNA: Viral homologues of the protein products cause Alzheimer's disease and others via autoimmune mechanisms.", ['Christopher J. Carter'], u'2010-08-12', u'The human genome is composed of millions of fragmented contiguous viral DNA sequences, dating from the dawn of evolution and reflecting retroviral insertions over millions of years of coexistence. Herpes and other viral insertion points correspond to the locations of over 120 Alzheimer&apos;s disease susceptibility genes and to linkage hotspots. The greater the number of pathogen matches, the more important the gene. These DNA sequences are translated into short contiguous 5-12 amino acid stretches (vatches), identical in viruses and man, and in other pathogens implicated in Alzheimer&apos;s disease (Borrelia, Chlamydia, Helicobacter, C. Neoformans , P. Gingivalis). C. Neoformans, which has been associated with a rare but curable form of dementia, expresses the most number of hits to Alzheimer&apos;s disease proteins. Vatches are often immunogenic and antibodies to viral proteins may knock down their human counterparts or activate immune responses killing the cells containing their human homologues. This is supported by the presence of the complement membrane attack complex in Alzheimer&apos;s disease neurones and by the ability of tau antigens (homologous to pathogen proteins) to promote the formation of neurofibrillary tangles and Alzheimer&apos;s disease pathology in mice. Vatches may act as dummy ligands or decoy receptors and interfere with the interactome of their human counterparts. Alzheimer&apos;s disease is thus a "pathogenetic" disorder caused by pathogens but dependent on the genes that create these matching sequences. This scenario is relevant to many other, and perhaps most human disorders, given the massive genomic extent of viral coverage. The vatches in the human proteome, dictated by polymorphisms and mutations, may predict, from birth, the spectrum of pathogens that match our proteins and which pathogenetic disease we are likely to develop. These may all be preventable by vaccination, pathogen detection and elimination and curable by immunosuppressant approaches, perhaps with a unique, safe, and effective immunosuppressant panacea.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/4765/version/1', [u'Genetics & Genomics', u'Microbiology', u'Molecular Cell Biology', u'Bioinformatics'], [u'Polygenic Pathways']]

Gupta Udatha', 'Irene  Kouskoumvekaki', 'Lisbeth Olsson', 'Gianni  Panagiotou'], u'2010-08-11', u'One of the most intriguing groups of enzymes, the feruloyl esterases (FAEs), is ubiquitous in both simple and complex organisms. FAEs have gained importance in biofuel, medicine and food industries due to their capability of acting on a large range of substrates for cleaving ester bonds and synthesizing high-added value molecules through esterification and transesterification reactions. During the past two decades extensive studies have been carried out on the production and partial characterization of FAEs from fungi, while much less is known about FAEs of bacterial or plant origin. Initial classification studies on FAEs were restricted on sequence similarity and substrate specificity on just four model substrates and considered only a handful of FAEs belonging to the fungal kingdom. This study centers on the descriptor-based classification and structural analysis of experimentally verified and putative FAEs; nevertheless, the framework presented here is applicable to every poorly characterized enzyme family. 365 FAE-related sequences of fungal, bacterial and plantae origin were collected and they were clustered using Self Organizing Maps followed by k-means clustering into distinct groups based on amino acid composition and physico-chemical composition descriptors derived from the respective amino acid sequence. A Support Vector Machine model was subsequently constructed for the classification of new FAEs into the pre-assigned clusters. The model successfully recognized 98.2% of the training sequences and all the sequences of the blind test. The underlying functionality of the 12 proposed FAE families was validated against a combination of prediction tools and published experimental data. Another important aspect of the present work involves the development of pharmacophore models for the new FAE families, for which sufficient information on known substrates existed.  Knowing the pharmacophoric features of a small molecule that are essential for binding to the members of a certain family opens a window of opportunities for tailored applications of FAEs.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/4762/version/1', [u'Biotechnology', u'Chemistry', u'Genetics & Genomics', u'Bioinformatics', u'Evolutionary Biology'], [u'Chalmers University of Technology', u'Technical University of Denmark']]

Here we show that a stochastic dynamical model of genetic networks can satisfactorily describe all these important features of differentiation, and others. The model is based on the emergent properties of generic genetic networks, it does not refer to specific control circuits and it can therefore hold for a wide class of lineages.

[u'Solving the protein folding problems', ['Robert P. Bywater'], u'2010-08-02', u'The protein folding problem persists in being the major unsolved problem in biophysics and molecular biology. The most immediate obstacle to its solution is said to be the immense combinatorial difficulty of finding the global minimum energy structure, due to the galactic number of possible rotamer states for the polypeptide backbone and its sidechains, the so-called Levinthal paradox1. Much attention has been paid to the topography of the free energy surface that the folding polypeptide has to negotiate in order to find this minimum and the notion of a funnel-shaped topography has been proposed2. While this has achieved wide acceptance, providing insight into the possible shape of the free energy surface, it still does not solve the problem. In this work it is suggested that, in order to proceed further with this line of enquiry, it would be useful to focus on not one but, rather, two of the free energy minima accessible to the folding polypeptide. These two minima are considered to represent the active and inactive, or resting, states of the protein.

Nevertheless, little is known regarding the association of WC with the risk of CVD in non-Caucasian populations.

During a mean follow-up of 8.6 years, 2,722 incident cases of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) including 1,383 cases of ischemic heart disease (IHD) and 1,012 cases of stroke were documented. Results: Average WC at baseline was 84.0\xb18.2 cm in men and 75.2\xb18.9 cm in women. After adjustment for age and BMI, WC was significantly associated with cardiovascular risk factors (P <.001). In men, a WC of \u226591 cm was associated with an ASCVD hazard ratio (HR) of 1.62 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.25, 2.10) and an IHD HR of 1.70 (95% CI: 1.19, 2.42) in comparison with a WC of <78 cm even after further adjustment for BMI and traditional risk factors (P for trend = 0.0118, 0.0139 respectively). In women, the progressive associations of WC with ASCVD, IHD and stroke were observed. These associations were however attenuated after further adjustment for BMI and traditional risk factors.

We present a new aptamer-based proteomic technology for biomarker discovery capable of simultaneously measuring thousands of proteins from small sample volumes (15 \u03bcL of serum or plasma).  Our current assay allows us to measure ~800 proteins with very low limits of detection (1 pM average), 7 logs of overall dynamic range, and 5% average coefficient of variation.  This technology is enabled by a new generation of aptamers that contain chemically modified nucleotides, which greatly expand the physicochemical diversity of the large randomized nucleic acid libraries from which the aptamers are selected.  Proteins in complex matrices such as plasma are measured with a process that transforms a signature of protein concentrations into a corresponding DNA aptamer concentration signature, which is then quantified with a DNA microarray.  In essence, our assay takes advantage of the dual nature of aptamers as both folded binding entities with defined shapes and unique sequences recognizable by specific hybridization probes.  To demonstrate the utility of our proteomics biomarker discovery technology, we applied it to a clinical study of chronic kidney disease (CKD).  We identified two well known CKD biomarkers as well as an additional 58 potential CKD biomarkers.  These results demonstrate the potential utility of our technology to discover unique protein signatures characteristic of various disease states.

Methods: Analyses of nationally representative cross-sectional population surveys, the Health Survey for England (HSE), including non-institutionalised men and women aged \u226565years.Results: Generalised obesity and abdominal obesity increased among men and women from 1993 to 2008. In 2005, the HSE 2005 focussed on older people. 72% of men and 68% of women aged over 65 were either overweight or obese. Prevalence of raised WC was higher in women (58%) than in men (46%). Multivariate analysis confirmed that generalised and abdominal obesity were independently associated with risk of hypertension, diabetes and arthritis in both men and women. In women only, there was an association between generalised obesity and having a fall in the last year (OR: 1.5), and between abdominal obesity and having a joint replacement (OR: 1.9, p=0.01) Conclusion: Complications of obesity such as diabetes, hypertension and arthritis, are more common in men and women aged over 65 who are overweight or obese, as well as in those with a raised waist circumference. These conditions impact on morbidity, mortality and have cost implications for the health service and are known to improve with weight loss even in old age.

Analogous to sequence alignment, efficient and reliable network alignment methods will improve our understanding of biological systems. Network alignment is computationally hard. Hence, devising efficient network alignment heuristics is currently one of the foremost challenges in computational biology. Results: We present a superior heuristic network alignment algorithm, called Matching-based GRAph ALigner (M-GRAAL), which can process and integrate any number and type of similarity measures between network nodes (e.g., proteins), including, but not limited to, any topological network similarity measure, sequence similarity, functional similarity, and structural similarity. This is efficient in resolving ties in similarity measures and in finding a combination of similarity measures yielding the largest biologically sound alignments. When used to align protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks of various species, M-GRAAL exposes the largest known functional and contiguous regions of network similarity. Hence, we use M-GRAAL\u2019s alignments to predict functions of un-annotated proteins in yeast, human, and bacteria C. jejuni and E. coli. Furthermore, using M-GRAAL to compare PPI networks of different herpes viruses, we reconstruct their phylogenetic relationship and our phylogenetic tree is the same as sequenced-based one.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/4505/version/1', [u'Molecular Cell Biology', u'Bioinformatics'], [u'University of California, Irvine', u'Imperial College London']]

Here, we analyze data from multiple cancers using a novel computational method identifying sets of genes whose coordinated overexpression indicates the presence of a particular phenotype. We conclude that there is one shared \u201ccore\u201d metastasis-associated gene expression signature corresponding to a specific variant of desmoplastic reaction, present in a large subset of samples that have exceeded a threshold of invasive transition specific to each cancer, indicating that the biological mechanism is triggered at that point. For example this threshold is reached at stage IIIc in ovarian cancer and at stage II in colorectal cancer. It has several features, such as coordinated expression of particular collagens, mainly COL11A1 and other genes, mainly THBS2 and INHBA. The universally prominent presence of INHBA in all cancers strongly suggests a biological mechanism centered on activin A induced TGF-\u03b2 signaling, because activin A is a member of the TGF-\u03b2 superfamily consisting of an INHBA homodimer. It is accompanied by the expression of several transcription factors related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition, but not of SNAI1, and expression of E-cadherin is not downregulated. It is reversible, as evidenced by its absence in many matched metastasized samples, but its presence indicates that metastasis has occurred. Therefore, these results can be used for developing high-specificity biomarkers, as well as potential multi-cancer metastasis-inhibiting therapeutics targeting the corresponding biological mechanism.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/4503/version/1', [u'Biotechnology', u'Cancer', u'Bioinformatics'], [u'Columbia University', u'Philips Research North America']]

Instead, most of such information is in the form of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). ncRNAs correspond to genes that are transcribed, but do not get translated into proteins. This part of the genome was, till recently, considered as \u2018junk\u2019. The term \u2018junk\u2019 implied lack of any discernible function of these RNA. More than 98% of the human genomic size encompasses these non-coding RNAs. But, recent research has evidently brought out the indispensible contribution of non-coding RNA in controlling and regulating gene expression. ncRNA such as siRNAs and microRNAs have been reported to greatly help in causing post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) in cells through RNA interference (RNAi) pathway. In this work, we have investigated the possibility of using siRNAs and microRNAs to aid in gene silencing of early onset Alzheimer\u2019s disease genes. Alzheimer\u2019s disease specific mutations and their corresponding positions in mRNA have been identified for six genes; Presenilin-1, Presenilin-2, APP (amyloid beta precursor protein), APBB3, BACE-1 and PSENEN. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that can cause PTGS through RNA interference pathway have been designed. RNA analysis has been done to verify complementarity of antisense siRNA sequence with target mRNA sequence. Interaction studies have been done computationally between these antisense siRNA strands and seven Argonaute proteins. From the interaction studies, only one of the seven Argonaute proteins; 1Q8K, was found to have interaction with the siRNAs indicating the importance and uniqueness of this particular protein in RISC (RNA induced silencing complex).  The interaction studies have been carried out for the microRNAs also. Out of the 700 mature human microRNAs collected, 394 microRNAs have been identified to show partial complementarity with their target sequence on PSEN-1 mRNA.  Of these 394, five microRNAs have shown partial complementarity to early onset Alzheimer\u2019s disease specific mutations in PSEN-1 mRNA.

These advances have been exploited for detecting differential expressed genes across biological samples and for quantifying the abundances of various RNA transcripts within one gene. However, explicit strategies for detecting the hidden differential abundances of RNA transcripts in biological samples have not been defined. In this work, we present two novel statistical tests to address this issue: a \u2018gene structure sensitive\u2019 Poisson test for detecting differential expression when the transcript structure of the gene is known, and a kernel-based test called Maximum Mean Discrepancy when it is unknown. We analyzed the proposed approaches on simulated read data for two artificial samples as well as on factual reads generated by the Illumina Genome Analyzer for two C. elegans samples. Our analysis shows that the Poisson test identifies genes with differential transcript expression considerably better that previously proposed RNA transcript quantification approaches for this task. The MMD test is able to detect a large fraction (75%) of such differential cases without the knowledge of the annotated transcripts.

[u'Improved prediction of protein interaction from microarray data using asymmetric correlation', ['Kojiro Yano'], u'2010-05-09', u'Background:Detection of correlated gene expression is a fundamental process in the characterization of gene functions using microarray data. Commonly used methods such as the Pearson correlation can detect only a fraction of interactions between genes or their products. However, the performance of correlation analysis can be significantly improved either by providing additional biological information or by combining correlation with other techniques that can extract various mathematical or statistical properties of gene expression from microarray data. In this article, I will test the performance of three correlation methods-the Pearson correlation, the rank (Spearman) correlation, and the Mutual Information approach-in detection of protein-protein interactions, and I will further examine the properties of these techniques when they are used together. I will also develop a new correlation measure which can be used with other measures to improve predictive power.Results:Using data from 5,896 microarray hybridizations, the three measures were obtained for 30,499 known protein-interacting pairs in the Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD). Pearson correlation showed the best sensitivity (0.305) but the three measures showed similar specificity (0.240 \u2013 0.257). When the three measures were compared, it was found that better specificity could be obtained at a high Pearson coefficient combined with a low Spearman coefficient or Mutual Information. Using a toy model of two gene interactions, I found that such measure combinations were most likely to exist at stronger curvature. I therefore introduced a new measure, termed asymmetric correlation (AC), which directly quantifies the degree of curvature in the expression levels of two genes as a degree of asymmetry. I found that AC performed better than the other measures, particularly when high specificity was required. Moreover, a combination of AC with other measures significantly improved specificity and sensitivity, by up to 50%.  Conclusions: A combination of correlation measures, particularly AC and Pearson correlation, can improve prediction of protein-protein interactions. Further studies are required to assess the biological significance of asymmetry in expression patterns of gene pairs.

[u'Tumor suppressors p53, p63, and p73 inhibit migrating cancer stem cells by increasing the expression of stem cell suppressing miRNAs', ['Lakshmanane Boominathan'], u'2010-04-26', u'ZEB1/2 has been shown to suppress the expression of the tumor suppressors E-cadherin, TA-p73, INK4b, CDKN1a, and thereby promotes epithelial to mesenchymal transition, invasion, and metastasis.  I have recently shown that p53-dependent miRs, such as miR-192, 215, 145, 203, 200b/c, 183, suppress the expression of ZEB1/2.  Another recent study showed that ZEB1/2 suppresses the expression of miR-200b/c, miR-203, & miR-183, which in turn, inhibit the expression of stem cell factors, such as Sox-2, Klf-4, and BMI.  ZEB1/2, by inhibiting the expression of stem cell factors suppressing miRs, it up regulates the expression of stem cell factors.  By up regulating the stem cell factors and down regulating metastasis suppressors, ZEB1/2 promotes both metastasis and migration of cancer stem cells.  p53/p63/p73, by down regulating the expression of ZEB1/2 through its target miRNAs, it could activate the expression of stem cell suppressing miRNAs, such as miR-200b/c, miR-203 & miR-183.  Thereby, it could inhibit the expression of stem cell factors, such as Sox-2, Klf-4 and BMI-1(an inhibitor of INK4a/ARF).  In addition, p53/p63/p73 appears to inhibit the expression of other EMT inducers, such as Snail1/2 and Twist, expression through its target miRs.  Remarkably, bioinformatics analysis of stem cell factors suppressing miRNAs, miR-200, miR-183, miR-141, and miR-203, promoters revealed a number of p53/p63/p73 responsive elements, indicating that they could be direct transcriptional targets of p53/TA-p63/p73.  Together, these data suggest that p53/TA-p63/p73, by suppressing the expression of ZEB1/2, Snail1/2, and Twist through its target miRs, it could inhibit migration, metastasis, and proliferation of cancer stem cells.  In conclusion, the data presented here provide mechanistic insights into how TA-p63/p73 and p53 function as metastasis suppressors.

[u'Molecular and nanostructural mechanisms of deformation, strength and toughness of spider silk fibrils', ['Andrea Nova', 'Sinan Keten', 'Nicola Pugno', 'Alberto Redaelli', 'Markus  J. Buehler'], u'2010-04-07', u'Spider silk is one of the strongest, most extensible and toughest biological materials known, exceeding the properties of many engineered materials including steel.  Silks feature a hierarchical architecture where highly organized, densely H-bonded beta-sheet nanocrystals are arranged within a semi-amorphous protein matrix consisting of 31-helices and beta-turn protein structures. By using a bottom-up molecular-based mesoscale model that bridges the scales from Angstroms to hundreds of nanometers, here we show that the specific combination of a crystalline phase and a semi-amorphous matrix is crucial for the unique properties of silks. Specifically, our results reveal that the superior mechanical properties of spider silk can be explained solely by structural effects, where the geometric confinement of beta-sheet nanocrystals combined with highly extensible semi-amorphous domains with a large hidden length is the key to reach great strength and great toughness, despite the dominance of mechanically inferior chemical interactions such as H-bonding. Our model directly shows that semi-amorphous regions unravel first when silk is being stretched, leading to the large extensibility of silk. Conversely, the large-deformation mechanical properties and ultimate tensile strength of silk is controlled by the strength of beta-sheet nanocrystals, which is directly related to their size, where small beta-sheet nanocrystals are crucial to reach outstanding levels of strength and toughness. Our model agrees well with observations in recent experiments, where it was shown that a significant change in the strength and toughness can be achieved solely by tuning the size of beta-sheet nanocrystals. Our findings unveil the material design strategy that enables silks to achieve superior material performance despite simple and inferior constituents, resulting in a new paradigm in materials design where enhanced functionality is not achieved using complex building blocks, but rather through the utilization of simple repetitive constitutive elements arranged in hierarchical structures.

These time series are corrupted by molecular and experimental noise that requires removal, but classical signal processing is of limited use for recovering such step-like dynamics. This paper reports simple, novel Bayesian filters that are robust to step-like dynamics in noise, and introduce an L1-regularized, global filter whose sparse solution can be rapidly obtained by standard convex optimization methods.

[u'A Rate Distortion approach to protein symmetry', ['Rodrick Wallace'], u'2010-03-29', u'A spontaneous symmetry breaking argument is applied to the problem of protein folding, via a Rate Distortion analysis of the relation between genome coding and the final condensation of the protein molten globule. In the \u2018energy\u2019 picture, the average distortion between codon message and protein structure, under constraints driven by evolutionary selection, serves as a temperature analog, so that low values limit the possible distribution of protein forms, producing the canonical folding funnel. A dual \u2018developmental\u2019 perspective sees the rate distortion function itself as the temperature analog, and permits incorporation of chaperons or toxic exposures as catalysts, driving the system to different possible outcomes or affecting the rate of convergence. The rate distortion function appears constrained by the availability of metabolic free energy, with implications for prebiotic evolution, and a nonequilibrium empirical Onsager treatment provides an adaptable statistical model that can be fitted to data, in the same manner as a regression equation.     Mechanistic models of protein folding fail to account for the observed spectrum of folding and aggregation disorders, suggesting that a biologically based cognitive paradigm describing the folding process will be needed for understanding the etiology, prevention, and treatment of these diseases.

Development of OSCC is a multi-step process involving genes related to cell cycle, growth control, apoptosis, DNA damage response and other cellular regulators. The pathogenic pathways involved in this tumor are mostly unknown and therefore a better characterization of OSCC gene expression profile would represent a considerable advance. The availability of publicly available gene expression datasets has opened up new challenges especially for the integration of data generated by different research groups and different array platforms with the purpose of obtaining new insights on the biological process investigated.Results: In this work we performed a meta-analysis on four microarray and four datasets of gene expression data on OSCC in order to evaluate the degree of agreement of the biological results obtained by these different studies and to identify common regulatory pathways that could be responsible of tumor growth. Sixteen dys-regulated pathways implicated in OSCC were mined out from the four published datasets, and most importantly three pathways were first reported. Those regulatory pathways and biological processes which are significantly enriched have been investigated by means of literatures and meanwhile, four genes of the maximally altered pathways, ECM-receptor interaction, were validated and identified by qRT-PCR as a possible candidate of aggressiveness of OSCC.Conclusion: we have developed a robust method for analyzing pathways altered in OSCC using three expression array data sets.

[u'Using open access literature to guide full-text query formulation', ['Heather A. Piwowar', 'Wendy W. Chapman'], u'2010-03-09', u'Background Much scientific knowledge is contained in the details of the full-text biomedical literature.  Most research in automated retrieval presupposes that the target literature can be downloaded and preprocessed prior to query. Unfortunately, this is not a practical or maintainable option for most users due to licensing restrictions, website terms of use, and sheer volume.  Scientific article full-text is increasingly queriable through portals such as PubMed Central, Highwire Press, Scirus, and Google Scholar.  However, because these portals only support very basic Boolean queries and full text is so expressive, formulating an effective query is a difficult task for users.  We propose improving the formulation of full-text queries by using the open access literature as a proxy for the literature to be searched.  We evaluated the feasibility of this approach by building a high-precision query for identifying studies that perform gene expression microarray experiments.Methodology and Results We built decision rules from unigram and bigram features of the open access literature.   Minor syntax modifications were needed to translate the decision rules into the query languages of PubMed Central, Highwire Press, and Google Scholar.  We mapped all retrieval results to PubMed identifiers and considered our query results as the union of retrieved articles across all portals.  Compared to our reference standard, the derived full-text query found 56% (95% confidence interval, 52% to 61%) of intended studies, and 90% (86% to 93%) of studies identified by the full-text search met the reference standard criteria.  Due to this relatively high precision, the derived query was better suited to the intended application than alternative baseline MeSH queries.Significance Using open access literature to develop queries for full-text portals is an open, flexible, and effective method for retrieval of biomedical literature articles based on article full-text.  We hope our approach will raise awareness of the constraints and opportunities in mainstream full-text information retrieval and provide a useful tool for today\u2019s researchers.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/4267/version/2', [u'Bioinformatics'], [u'University of Pittsburgh']]

[u'Apparent non-canonical trans-splicing is generated by reverse transcriptase in vitro', ['David Tollervey', 'Jonathan Houseley'], u'2010-02-05', u'Trans-splicing, the in vivo joining of two RNA molecules, is well characterized in several groups of simple organisms but was long thought absent from fungi, plants and mammals. However, recent bioinformatic analyses of expressed sequence tag (EST) databases suggested widespread trans-splicing in mammals1-2. Splicing, including the characterised trans-splicing systems, involves conserved sequences at the splice junctions. Our analysis of a yeast non-coding RNA revealed that around 30% of the products of reverse transcription lacked an internal region of 117 nt, suggesting that the RNA was spliced. The junction sequences lacked canonical splice-sites but were flanked by direct repeats, and further analyses indicated that the apparent splicing actually arose because reverse transcriptase can switch templates during transcription3. Many newly identified, apparently trans-spliced, RNAs lacked canonical splice sites but were flanked by short regions of homology, leading us to question their authenticity. Here we report that all reported categories of non-canonical splicing could be replicated using an in vitro reverse transcription system with highly purified RNA substrates. We observed the reproducible occurrence of ostensible trans-splicing, exon shuffling and sense-antisense fusions. The latter generate apparent antisense non-coding RNAs, which are also reported to be abundant in humans4. Different reverse transcriptases can generate different products of template switching, providing a simple diagnostic.

[u'Modeling Three-Dimensional Spatial Regulation of Bacterial Cell Division (Dissertation)', ['Satya N. V. Arjunan'], u'2010-02-05', u'Many important cellular processes are regulated by reaction-diffusion (RD) of molecules that takes place both in the cytoplasm and on the membrane. To model and analyze such multicompartmental processes, we developed a lattice-based Monte Carlo method, Spatiocyte that supports RD in volume and surface compartments at single molecule resolution. Stochasticity in RD and the excluded volume effect brought by intracellular molecular crowding, both of which can significantly affect RD and thus, cellular processes, are also supported. We verified the method by comparing simulation results of diffusion, irreversible and reversible reactions with the predicted analytical and best available numerical solutions. Moreover, to directly compare the localization patterns of molecules in fluorescence microscopy images with simulation, we devised a visualization method that mimics the microphotography process by showing the trajectory of simulated molecules averaged according to the camera exposure time. In the rod-shaped bacterium Escherichia coli, the division site is suppressed at the cell poles by periodic pole-to-pole oscillations of the Min proteins (MinC, MinD and MinE) arising from carefully orchestrated RD in both cytoplasm and membrane compartments. Using Spatiocyte we could model and reproduce the in vivo MinDE localization dynamics by accounting for the previously reported properties of MinE. Our results suggest that the MinE ring, which is essential in preventing polar septation, is largely composed of MinE that is transiently attached to the membrane independently after recruited by MinD. Overall, Spatiocyte allows simulation and visualization of complex spatial and reaction-diffusion mediated cellular processes in volumes and surfaces.

Chang', 'Tuan Pham', 'Sharon Young', 'Amit Kaushal', 'James J. Lee', 'Pasquale Patrizio', 'Eric A. Evans'], u'2010-02-01', u'Background: Mendelian disorders are individually rare but collectively common, forming a \u201clong tail\u201d of genetic disease. More than 20 million people worldwide suffer from a disease in this long tail before the age of 25, with minorities and developing countries at highest risk and with the number of carriers far in excess of this figure. Importantly, the Jewish community\u2019s campaign for universal Tay-Sachs screening shows that these incurable diseases can nevertheless be prevented if carrier status is known before conception. A single highly-accurate assay for the long tail of Mendelian disease would allow us to scale this successful campaign up to the general population, thereby improving millions of lives, greatly benefiting minority health, and saving billions of dollars. Methods and Findings: We have addressed the need for such an assay by designing the Universal Genetic Test (UNIT), a non-invasive, saliva-based carrier test for more than 100 Mendelian diseases across all major population groups. We exhaustively validated the test with a median of 147 positive and 525 negative samples per variant. By combining probes for risk alleles with family history information, we show that we can achieve extremely high levels of accuracy (median 95% CI [0.99988, 0.999999]), precision (median 95% CI [0.99993, 0.99999]), sensitivity (median 95% CI [0.99988, 0.999999]), and specificity (median 95% CI [0.99643, 1]) at the level of individual mutations. In particular, through a combination of replicated probes and confirmatory testing, we are able to reliably detect rare alleles at q \u2248 1/1000 with positive predictive values above 0.995. To put this in context, this performance for a multiplex assay compares favorably with FDA-approved single-gene carrier tests. Conclusions: The UNIT represents a dramatic reduction in the cost and complexity of large scale population screening. With a single inexpensive assay for a substantial fraction of the global Mendelian disease burden, an end to many preventable genetic diseases is now in sight. Moreover, given that the assay requires only a saliva sample, it is for the first time feasible to contemplate an \u201cat-home carrier test\u201d as a successor to the at-home pregnancy test.Authors\u2019 note:Nature Precedings is a preprint server used by scientists to communicate results in advance of the often lengthy publication process.

In this paper we report findings on the interaction between the TATA box binding protein (TBP) and DNA, using a novel optical technology, that point to a potential plausible physical mechanism, and at the same time tie together a number of otherwise disparate observations. TBP plays a central and ubiquitous role in initiating eukaryotic transcription, binding to promoters with and without the canonical 5\u2019 TATA(A/T)A(A/T)(G/A) 3\u2019 motif1. It also tends to bind to double-stranded DNA promiscuously, and though affinity is lower, the number of binding opportunities is greater. TBP-DNA complexes have been characterized structurally2,3 and thermodynamically4,5, the standard model representing the TBP double-helix complex as the biologically significant entity. Here we show, using a label-free detection method termed Spectral Reflectance Imaging Biosensor6 (SRIB) that TBP binds to single stranded (ss), as well as double stranded (ds), oligonucleotides with the TATA motif, and binds the single-stranded form preferentially. Moreover, TBP binds preferentially to single stranded pyrimidine-rich sequences over purine-rich sequences, which is similar to the Single-Stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) binding pattern. These observations suggest a new model for eukaryotic transcription in which TBP destabilizes the double helix, thereby initiating the open complex bubble necessary for transcription. Furthermore, the role of TBP as a multifunctional protein is discussed.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/4139/version/1', [u'Biotechnology', u'Genetics & Genomics', u'Microbiology', u'Molecular Cell Biology', u'Bioinformatics'], [u'Boston University']]

For each rat from the real acupuncture group (n = 40), sham acupoint treatment group (n = 54), and blank control group (n = 16), we acquired 3-D FDG-microPET images at baseline, after MCAO, and after treatment (i.e., real acupuncture, sham acupoint treatment, or resting according to the group assignment), respectively. After verifying that the injured area is in the right hemisphere of the cerebral cortex in the brain by using magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) and triphenyl tetrazolium cchloride (TTC)-staining, we directly compared the glucose metabolism in the right hemisphere of each rat. We carried out t-test and permutation test on the image data. Both tests demonstrated that acupuncture had a more positive effect than non-acupoint stimulus and blank control (P < 0.025) in increasing the glucose metabolic level in the stroke-injured area in the brain, while there was no statistically significant difference between non-acupoint stimulus and blank control (P>0.15). The immediate positive effect of acupuncture over sham acupoint treatment and blank control is verified using our experiments. The long-term benefit of acupuncture needs to be further studied.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/4128/version/1', [u'Neuroscience', u'Bioinformatics'], [u'State Key Laboratory of Modern Optical Instrumentation,  Department of Optical Engineering, Zhejiang University', u'Department of Acupuncture and Moxibustion,  Hubei College of Traditional Chinese Medicine', u'Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology']]

By combining the genome-wide gene expression data with the genomic sequence data, we proposed multiple-instance scoring (MIS) method to predict the tissue-specific motifs and the corresponding CRRs.

This paper describes the Ontology Pre-Processor Language (OPPL), a domain-specific macro language, based in the Manchester OWL Syntax, for manipulating ontologies written in OWL. OPPL instructions can add/remove entities, and add/remove axioms (semantics or annotations) to/from entities in an OWL ontology. OPPL is suitable for applying the same change to different ontologies or at different development stages, and for keeping track of the changes made (e.g. in pipelines). It is also suitable for defining independent modelling macros (e.g. Ontology Design Patterns) that can be applied at will and systematically across an ontology. The presented OPPL Instruction Manager is a Java library that processes OPPL instructions making the changes to an OWL ontology. A reference implementation that uses the OPPL Instruction Manager is also presented.

[u'Evaluation of the Cell Ontology (CL)', ['Lindsay G. Cowell'], u'2009-11-12', u'An ontological representation of the entities relevant to biological research is urgently needed.  The cell ontology developed by Bard and colleagues (CL) (Bard et al. 2005) makes a significant contribution towards fulfilling this need by providing an ontology of cell types.  The CL has already proven useful for data annotation (e.g. Grumbling et al. 2006), although the ontology\u2019s potential utility goes well beyond that specific application.  For example, using the number of distinct cell types in an organism as a measure of biological complexity, Vogel and Chothia (2006) compared the proteomes of 38 organisms of varying complexity and identified patterns in the evolution and expansion of protein domain superfamilies.  This work has implications for some of the fundamental questions in biology, such as understanding the processes by which physiology becomes more intricate, new cell types arise, and biological complexity increases.  While Vogel and Chothia did not yet utilize the CL for this work, they cite Bard et al. (2005) and describe the ontology\u2019s value for improving and extending their analysis.  Thus, in addition to its great utility for database annotation, the CL has the potential to play a significant role in basic scientific inquiry.The prospect of using the CL (and other ontologies) for this type of scientific research is extremely exciting but also imposes requirements on the level of formal rigor applied in ontology development, on the adequacy of the ontology as a representation of reality, and on its adherence to community standards of best practice.  It is with these things in mind that I examined the CL to determine whether any revision would be required before my research group could use it for scientific research.After carefully evaluating the CL, my overall impression is that it does not possess the rigor and exactness required of a reference ontology.  Furthermore, the problems I see are significant enough that it would be difficult for my research group to use the CL as our application ontology.  While some of the problems could be resolved by changing a relation or rewriting a definition, others would require careful rethinking of the ontology\u2019s foundation, because they involve the scope and organizing principle of the ontology as a whole.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/3971/version/1', [u'Bioinformatics'], [u'Duke University Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics']]

In this work, we investigate the role of fluxes of matter cycling in metabolic networks. First, we introduce a methodology for the computation of cyclic and acyclic fluxes in metabolic networks, adapted from an algorithm initially developed to study cyclic fluxes in trophic networks. Subsequently, we apply this methodology to the analysis of three metabolic systems, including the central metabolism of wild type and a deletion mutant of Escherichia coli, erythrocyte metabolism and the central metabolism of the bacterium Methylobacterium extorquens. The role of cycles in driving and maintaining the performance of metabolic functions upon perturbations is unveiled through these examples.

We characterize speech with signal processing algorithms, extracting clinically useful features of average PD progression. Subsequently, we select the most parsimonious model with a robust feature selection algorithm, and statistically map the selected subset of features to UPDRS using linear and nonlinear regression techniques, which include classical least squares and non-parametric classification and regression trees (CART). We verify our findings on the largest database of PD speech in existence (~6,000 recordings from 42 PD patients, recruited to a six-month, multi-centre trial).

[u'Voluntary universal testing and treatment is unlikely to lead to HIV elimination: a modeling analysis', ['Bradley  G.

They assumed all individuals would be tested annually and every infected individual (regardless of stage of infection) would be put on treatment. Based on this modeling study the WHO is considering using universal testing and treatment as an HIV elimination strategy. Here we examine the study by Granich et al. and assess its validity. We present new analyses of their model by varying assumptions and parameter values. We find that under certain very optimistic assumptions HIV elimination would be (theoretically) possible, but it would take at least 70 years. To obtain this result we assumed ~65% of symptomatic and ~20% of asymptomatic individuals would be treated per year; ARVs would reduce infectivity of treated individuals a hundred fold, and only 5% of symptomatic individuals would give up treatment per year. Even under optimistic assumptions we find elimination to be unlikely. For example, we show if ~65% of symptomatic individuals are treated per year and treated individuals are completely noninfectious, HIV will remain endemic with a prevalence of 34% and an incidence of 2% per year. We conclude that the model developed by Granich et al., when used with realistic parameter values, does not show HIV elimination is possible. However our modeling results show treatment could act as an effective prevention tool and significantly reduce transmission, even if only symptomatic individuals receive ARVs. Treatment should first, and foremost, be used for therapeutic purposes. Hence, we recommend \u2013 when resources are limited \u2013 targeting those in need of treatment. Such a strategy would be ethical, feasible and epidemiologically sound. We advise that models used as health policy tools should be carefully evaluated and their results interpreted with caution.

On the other hand, identical twins reveal a high concordance for schizophrenia. From that standpoint, the perspective that structurally-related proteins may play an important and yet non-deterministic role seems attractive. Among these proteins, it is suggestive that Neuregulin 1 exerts a pivotal role. Objective: This paper aims to uncover the most prominent relations that Neuregulin 1 establishes with schizophrenia. Method: Several bioinformatical methods are used in order to present: 1. A visual representation of Neuregulin 1\u2019s main molecular pathways, associated with a discussion about their importance to schizophrenia research; 2.

To model and analyze such multicompartmental processes, we developed a lattice-based Monte Carlo method, Spatiocyte that supports RD in volume and surface compartments at single molecule resolution. Stochasticity in RD and the excluded volume effect brought by intracellular molecular crowding, both of which can significantly affect RD and thus, cellular processes, are also supported. We verified the method by comparing simulation results of diffusion, irreversible and reversible reactions with the predicted analytical and best available numerical solutions. Moreover, to directly compare the localization patterns of molecules in fluorescence microscopy images with simulation, we devised a visualization method that mimics the microphotography process by showing the trajectory of simulated molecules averaged according to the camera exposure time. In the rod-shaped bacterium Escherichia coli, the division site is suppressed at the cell poles by periodic pole-to-pole oscillations of the Min proteins (MinC, MinD and MinE) arising from carefully orchestrated RD in both cytoplasm and membrane compartments. Using Spatiocyte we could model and reproduce the in vivo MinDE localization dynamics by accounting for the established properties of MinE. Our results suggest that the MinE ring, which is essential in preventing polar septation, is largely composed of MinE that is transiently attached to the membrane independently after recruited by MinD.

[u'Primate phylogeny: molecular evidence for a pongid clade excluding humans and a prosimian clade containing tarsiers ', ['Shi Huang'], u'2009-09-21', u'Interpretations of molecular data by the modern evolution theory are often sharply inconsistent with paleontological results.  This is to be expected since the theory is only true for microevolution and yet fossil records are mostly about macroevolution.  The maximum genetic diversity (MGD) hypothesis is a more coherent and complete account of evolution that has yet to meet a single contradiction.  Here, molecular data were analyzed based on the MGD to resolve key questions of primate phylogeny.  A new method was developed from a novel result predicted by the MGD: genetic non-equidistance to a simpler taxon only in slow but not in fast evolving sequences given non-equidistance in time.  This \u2018slow clock\u2019 method showed that humans are genetically more distant to orangutans than African apes are and separated from the pongid clade (containing orangutan and African apes) 17.3 million years ago.  Also, tarsiers are genetically closer to lorises than simian primates are, suggesting a tarsier-loris clade to the exclusion of simian primates.  The validity and internal coherence of the primate phylogeny here were independently verified.  The molecular split time of human and pongid calibrated from the fossil record of gorilla, or the fossil times for the radiation of anthropoids/mammals at the K/T boundary and for the Eutheria-Metatheria split in the Early Cretaceous, were independently confirmed from molecular dating calibrated using the fossil split times of tarsier-loris and two other pairs of mammals (mouse-rat and opossum-kangaroo).  This remarkable and unprecedented concordance between molecules and fossils provides the latest confirmation of the inseparable unity of genotype and phenotype and the unmatched value of MGD in a coherent interpretation of life history.

[u'Novel determinants describe chaperonin substrate proteins', ['Emanuele Raineri', 'Paolo Ribeca', 'Luis Serrano', 'Tobias Maier'], u'2009-09-15', u'Molecular chaperones ensure that their substrate proteins reach the functional native state and prevent their aggregation. The bacterial GroEL/ES chaperonin system is understood in great detail on a structural, mechanistic and functional level. Its substrate proteins in E. coli have been identified and characterized. However, a long standing and yet unresolved question in the field is: what makes a protein a chaperone substrate?Here we demonstrate with a bioinformatics-based approach that a simple set of criteria is sufficient to describe the GroEL substrate proteome to unprecedented accuracy. We define two novel parameters differentiating GroEL substrates from other cellular proteins: evolutionary rate and hydrophobicity. We demonstrate their conjunct applicability and explain why they are suitable descriptors. Combining them with other specific features of proteins, such as structure and size, we manage to identify the subset of GroEL substrate proteins with high confidence. We verify the applicability of our findings by correctly predicting a number of known heterologous GroEL substrate proteins.Furthermore, our results show that in vivo, the proposed buffering capacity of chaperones does not appear to be a dominant effect. Instead, the observed lower evolutionary rates among substrate proteins could be explained by their energetically unfavorable folding pathways not allowing for additional destabilizing mutations to occur.We show that a combination of simple parameters is sufficient to accurately describe the GroEL substrate proteome and to successfully predict known heterologous substrates. Our approach can potentially be used to predict chaperonin usage for any given polypeptide chain.

[u'Frequency-dependent selection predicts patterns of radiations and biodiversity', ['Carlos Melian', 'David Alonso', 'Diego Vazquez', 'James Regetz', 'Stefano Allesina'], u'2009-09-12', u'Most empirical studies support a decline in speciation rates through time, although evidence for constant speciation rates also exists. Declining rates have been explained by invoking niche-filling processes, whereas constant rates have been attributed to non-adaptive processes such as sexual selection, mutation, and dispersal. Trends in speciation rate and the processes underlying it remain unclear, representing a critical information gap in understanding patterns of global diversity. Here we show that the speciation rate is driven by frequency dependent selection. We used a frequency-dependent and DNA sequence-based model of populations and genetic-distance-based speciation, in the absence of adaptation to ecological niches. We tested the frequency-dependent selection mechanism using cichlid fish and Darwin&apos;s finches, two classic model systems for which speciation rates and richness data exist. Using negative frequency dependent selection, our model both predicts the declining speciation rate found in cichlid fish and explains their species richness. For groups like the Darwin&apos;s finches, in which speciation rates are constant and diversity is lower, the speciation rate is better explained by a model without frequency-dependent selection. Our analysis shows that differences in diversity are driven by larger incipient species abundance (and consequent lower extinction rates) with frequency-dependent selection. These results demonstrate that mutations, genetic-distance-based speciation, sexual and frequency-dependent selection are sufficient not only for promoting rapid proliferation of new species, but also for maintaining the high diversity observed in natural systems.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/3752/version/1', [u'Ecology', u'Genetics & Genomics', u'Bioinformatics', u'Earth & Environment', u'Evolutionary Biology'], [u'National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis, University of California, Santa Barbara', u'University of Groningen, Community and Conservation Ecology Group, Center for Ecological and Evolutionary Studies', u'Inst.

In the present paper, we model and simulate a transduction operator, exploring a possible role and usefulness of transduction in a genetic algorithm.

In this context, TB is in the top three, with malaria and HIV being the leading causes of death from a single infectious agent, and about two million deaths are attributable to TB annually. The bacterial enzyme MurA catalyzes the transfer of enolpyruvate from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to uridine diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine (UNAG), which is the first committed step of bacterial cell wall biosynthesis.  In this work, 3D structural model of Mtb-MurA enzyme has been developed, for the first time, by homology modeling and molecular dynamics simulation techniques. The model provided clear insight in its structure features, i.e. substrate binding pocket, and common docking site. Multiple sequence alignment and 3D structure model provided the putative substrate binding pocket of Mtb-MurA with respect to E.coli MurA. This analysis was helpful in identifying the binding sites and molecular function of the MurA homologue.

Similarly, specialized notations such as the Feynmann notation or the process flow diagrams did a lot for the adoption of concepts in their own fields. With the advent of Systems Biology, and more recently of Synthetic Biology, the need for precise and unambiguous descriptions of biochemical interactions has become more pressing. While some ideas have been advanced over the last decade, with a few detailed proposals, no actual community standard has emerged. The Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN) is a graphical representation crafted over several years by a community of biochemists, modellers and computer scientists. Three orthogonal and complementary languages have been created, the Process Descriptions, the Entity Relationships and the Activity Flows. Using these three idioms a scientist can represent any network of biochemical interactions, which can then be interpreted in an unambiguous way. The set of symbols used is limited, and the grammar quite simple, to allow its usage ranging from textbooks and teaching in high schools to peer reviewed articles in scientific journals.

This arises because all assembling programs must look at all the overlaps between reads at the same time, using RAM in order to construct contigs, and the memory of the computer can be filled up during this step, causing the abortion of the assembling process.Here we propose an algorithm that is capable of overcoming any memory limitation by using redundancy of processing and thus producing an increase in computing time but overcoming the memory limitation.The proposed algorithm consists in dividing the reads in a set of groups which size is half the maximum capability in memory of the computer used and performing assembling for all the possible combination pairs of such groups. After eliminating the redundancy of the set of contigs obtained in the previous step, the process is iterated until a set of contigs of manageable size is obtained such that the set can be handled by the assembler in a final step.Each step of the procedure increases the time of computing from k to approximately k + k(k-1)/2, but in many practical cases only one step is needed to finish the assembling process.

Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) ameliorate development of this behavioral abnormality. Time-series of microarray profiling of heads of male flies treated with PTZ has shown epileptogenesis-like transcriptomic perturbation in the fly model. Gender differences are known to exist in neurological and psychiatric conditions including epileptogenesis. We describe here the effects of chronic PTZ in Drosophila females, and compare the results with the male model. As in males, chronic PTZ was found found to cause a decreased climbing speed in females. In males, overrepresentation of Wnt, MAPK, TGF-beta, JAK-STAT, Cell communication, and Dorso-Ventral axis formation pathways in downregulated genes was previously described. Of these, female genes showed enrichment only for Dorso-Ventral axis formation. Most significant, ribosomal pathway was uniquely overrepresented in genes downregulated in females. Gender differences thus exist in the Drosophila model. Gender neutral, Dorso-Ventral axis formation may be considered as the candidate causal pathway in chronic pentylenetetrazole induced behavioral deficit.

[u'A Drosophila systems model of withdrawal from chronic pentylenetetrazole relevant in post-epileptogenesis  ', ['Priyanka Singh', 'Farhan Mohammad', 'Abhay Sharma'], u'2009-07-21', u'Rodent kindling induced by pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) is an established model of epileptogenesis and antiepileptic drug (AED) testing. Recently, a Drosophila systems model has been described in which chronic PTZ causes a decreased climbing speed in adult males on 7th day. Some AEDs ameliorate development of this locomotor deficit. Time-series of microarray expression profiles of heads of flies treated with PTZ has been found to resemble transcriptomic alterations associated with epileptogenesis. In the fly model, withdrawal from seven day long PTZ treatment causes an increased climbing speed on 7th consequent day. Here, we present a systems model of the post-PTZ withdrawal regime. Unlike AED-untreated individuals, flies treated with any of the five AEDs after PTZ discontinuation exhibited normal climbing speed on 7th day, i.e., 14th day from the beginning of PTZ treatment. Time-series of microarray expression profiles of fly heads comparing control PTZ- and AED-untreated, and AED-untreated post PTZ withdrawal groups showed differentially expressed genes throughout. These genes enriched gene ontology (GO) molecular functions including transcription regulator and GTPase regulator activities. Interestingly, expression profiles of fly heads comparing control PTZ- and AED-untreated, and AED-treated post PTZ withdrawal groups showed neutralization of transcription regulator and GTPase regulator activities by the AEDs. Further transcriptomic analysis based on overinteraction in protein interactome and enrichment of miRNA targets implicated axon guidance and neuronal remodeling related perturbations in the fly model. Differential expression of genes belonging to transcription regulator and GTPase regulator activities have previously been reported in post-epileptogenesis in established rodent models. Also, axon guidance and neuronal remodeling related alterations have been implicated in epilepsy. The Drosophila model thus provides a unique opportunity to dissect long-term plasticity relevant in epileptogenesis at cellular and molecular levels.

However, the analysis of gene expression in seals is hampered by the lack of specific microarrays and the very limited annotation of known Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddellii) genes.Results: Muscle samples from newborn, juvenile, and adult Weddell seals were collected during an Antarctic expedition. Extracted RNA was hybridized on Affymetrix Human Expression chips. Preliminary studies showed a detectable signal from at least 7000 probe sets present in all samples and replicates. Relative expression levels for these genes was used for further analysis of the biological pathways implicated in the metabolism transformation which occurs in the transition from newborn, to juvenile, to adult seals. Cytoskeletal remodeling, WNT signaling, FAK signaling, hypoxia-induced HIF1 activation, and insulin regulation were identified as being among the most important biological pathways involved in transformation. Conclusion: In spite of certain losses in specificity and sensitivity, the cross-species application of gene expression microarrays is capable of solving challenging puzzles in biology.

Alicea'], u'2009-06-16', u'In this paper, a method for decoupling the neuromuscular function of a set of limbs from the role morphology plays in regulating the performance of an activity is introduced. This method is based on two previous methods: the rescaled range analysis specific to time series data, and the use of scaling laws. A review of the literature suggests that limb geometry can either facilitate or constrain performance as measured experimentally. Whether limb geometry is facilitatory or acts as a constraint depends on the size differential between arm morphology and the underlying muscle. \u201cChanges in size and shape\u201d are theoretically extrapolations of morphological geometry to other members of a population or species, to other species, or to technological manipulations of an individual via prosthetic devices. Three datasets are analyzed using the range-based method and a Monte-Carlo simulation, and are used to test the various ways of executing this analysis. It was found that when performance is kept stable but limb size and shape is scaled by a factor of .25, the greatest gain in performance results. It was also found that introducing force-based perturbations results in \u2018shifts\u2019 in the body geometry/performance relationship. While results such as this could be interpreted as a statistical artifact, the non-linear rise within a measurement class and linear decrease between measurement classes suggests an effect of scale in the optimality of this relationship.

To investigate the evolution of estrogen binding to steroid receptors, we constructed a 3D model of amphioxus SR complexed with estradiol.  This 3D model indicates that although the SR is activated by estradiol, some interactions between estradiol and human ER\u03b1 are not conserved in the SR, which can explain the low affinity of estradiol for the SR.  These differences between the SR and ER\u03b1 in the steroid-binding domain are sufficient to suggest that another steroid is the physiological regulator of the SR.

However the reconstruction of such models remains an arduous process requiring a high level of human intervention. Their utilization is further hampered by the absence of standardized data and annotation formats and the lack of recognized quality and validation standards.Plants provide a particularly rich range of perspectives for applications of metabolic modeling. We here report the first effort to the reconstruction of a genome-scale model of the metabolic network of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, including over 2300 reactions and compounds. Our reconstruction was performed using a semi-automatic methodology based on the integration of two public genome-wide databases, significantly accelerating the process. Database entries were compared and integrated with each other, allowing us to resolve discrepancies and enhance the quality of the reconstruction. This process lead to the construction of three models based on different quality and validation standards, providing users with the possibility to choose the standard that is most appropriate for a given application. First, a core metabolic model containing only consistent data provides a high quality model that was shown to be stoichiometrically consistent. Second, an intermediate metabolic model attempts to fill gaps and provides better continuity. Third, a complete metabolic model contains the full set of known metabolic reactions and compounds in Arabidopsis thaliana.We provide an annotated SBML file of our core model to enable the maximum level of compatibility with existing tools and databases.

Ideally, the retrieval and integration of biological knowledge for model annotation should be performed quickly, precisely, and with a minimum of manual effort. Here, we present a method using off-the-shelf semantic web technology which enables this process: the heterogeneous data sources are first syntactically converted into ontologies; these are then aligned to a small domain ontology by applying a rule base. Integrating resources in this way can accommodate multiple formats with different semantics; it provides richly modelled biological knowledge suitable for annotation of SBML models.Results: We demonstrate proof-of-principle for this rule-based mediation with two use cases for SBML model annotation.

This is because we possess the so-called associative memory \u2013 the ability to correlate different memories to the same fact or event. Associative memory is such a fundamental and encompassing human ability (and not just human) that the network of neurons in our brain must perform it quite easily. The question is then whether electronic neural networks \u2013 electronic schemes that act somewhat similarly to human brains \u2013 can be built to perform this type of function. Although the field of neural networks has developed for many years, a key element, namely the synapses between adjacent neurons, has been lacking a satisfactory electronic representation. The reason for this is that a passive circuit element able to reproduce the synapse behaviour needs to remember its past dynamical history, store a continuous set of states, and be "plastic" according to the pre-synaptic and post-synaptic neuronal activity. Here we show that all this can be accomplished by a memory-resistor (memristor for short). In particular, by using simple and inexpensive off-the-shelf components we have built a memristor emulator which realizes all required synaptic properties. Most importantly, we have demonstrated experimentally the formation of associative memory in a simple neural network consisting of three electronic neurons connected by two memristor-emulator synapses.

[u'Human ovarian reserve from conception to the menopause', ['William H. B. Wallace', 'Thomas W. Kelsey'], u'2009-04-27', u'Current understanding is that the human ovary contains a fixed number of several million non-growing follicles (NGF), established by five months of gestational age, that declines with increasing age to the menopause when approximately 1,000 NGF remain at an average age of 50-51 years. With approximately 450 ovulatory monthly cycles in the normal human reproductive lifespan, this progressive decline in NGF numbers is attributed to follicle death by apoptosis. Individual histological studies have quantified NGF numbers over limited age ranges. However, no model describing the rate of establishment and decline of the NGF population from conception to menopause has been previously reported. Here we describe the best fitting model of the age-related NGF population in the human ovary from conception to menopause. Our model matches the log-adjusted NGF population to a five-parameter asymmetric double Gaussian cumulative (ADC) curve (r2 = 0.81). Furthermore we found that the rate of NGF recruitment into growing follicles for all women increases from birth until approximately age 14 years (coinciding with puberty) then decreases towards the menopause. The explanation for this new finding remains unclear but is likely to involve both paracrine and endocrine factors. We describe and analyse the best fitting model for the establishment and decline of human NGF; our model extends our current understanding of human ovarian reserve.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/3179/version/1', [u'Bioinformatics'], [u'Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Paediatric Oncology', u'University of St Andrews, School of Computer Science']]

Here, we analyze a single vocal pathology cohort, testing the performance of these alternative measures alongside classical measures.We present voice analysis pre- and post-operatively in unilateral vocal fold paralysis (UVFP) patients and healthy controls, patients undergoing standard medialisation thyroplasty surgery, using jitter, shimmer and noise-to-harmonic ratio (NHR), and nonlinear recurrence period density entropy (RPDE), detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) and correlation dimension. Systematizing the preparative editing of the recordings, we found that the novel measures were more stable and hence reliable, than the classical measures, on healthy controls.RPDE and jitter are sensitive to improvements pre- to post-operation. Shimmer, NHR and DFA showed no significant change (p > 0.05).

Recent advances in the field of network theory have facilitated ground-breaking analyses demonstrating that brain connectivity exhibits small-world properties similar to other self-organized networks such as the internet, the genome, or even social organizations. Brain connectivity supports local and global processing through high clustering and short connectivity paths, respectively. While these comprehensive network indices highlight the global organization of the network, the regional specificity is related to the interconnectivity of local neighborhoods within the global system. The work presented here evaluated the community structure of resting human brain networks to identify the local neighborhoods and map those interconnected areas back to the brain. The study identified predictable clustering in unisensory cortices. However, the unexpected community structure in the default-mode network (DMN) revealed three separate modules and included the lateral frontal cortices in addition to traditional DMN regions.

This is the case of neuromorphic engineering where technology and neuroscience cross-fertilize each other. For example, consider on one side the recently discovered memristor, postulated in 1974, thanks to research in nanotechnology electronics. On the other side, consider the mechanism known as Spike-Time-Dependent-Plasticity (STDP) which describes a neuronal synaptic learning mechanism that outperforms the traditional Hebbian synaptic plasticity proposed in 1949. STDP was originally postulated as a computer learning algorithm, and is being used by the machine intelligence and computational neuroscience community. At the same time its biological and physiological foundations have been reasonably well established during the past decade. If memristance and STDP can be related, then (a) recent discoveries in nanophysics and nanoelectronic principles may shed new lights into understanding the intricate molecular and physiological mechanisms behind STDP in neuroscience, and (b) new neuromorphic-like computers built out of nanotechnology memristive devices could incorporate the biological STDP mechanisms yielding a new generation of self-adaptive ultra-high-dense intelligent machines. Here we show that by combining memristance models with the electrical wave signals of neural impulses (spikes) converging from pre- and post-synaptic neurons into a synaptic junction, STDP behavior emerges naturally. This result serves to understand how neural and memristance parameters modulate STDP, which might bring new insights to neurophysiologists in searching for the ultimate physiological mechanisms responsible for STDP in biological synapses.

The classical model of cooperativity requires direct interactions between TFs, thus constraining the arrangement of TFs sites in a CRR. On the contrary, genomic and functional studies demonstrate a great deal of flexibility in such arrangements with variable distances, numbers of sites, and identities of the involved TFs. Such flexibility is inconsistent with the cooperativity by direct interactions between TFs. Here we demonstrate that strong cooperativity among non-interacting TFs can be achieved by their competition with nucleosomes. We find that the mechanism of nucleosome-mediated cooperativity is mathematically identical to the Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) model of cooperativity in hemoglobin. This surprising parallel provides deep insights, with parallels between heterotropic regulation of hemoglobin (e.g. Bohr effect) and roles of nucleosome-positioning sequences and chromatin modifications in gene regulation. Characterized mechanism is consistent with numerous experimental results, allows substantial flexibility in and modularity of CRRs, and provides a rationale for a broad range of genomic and evolutionary observations.

[u'A Reaction Route Approach to Flux Balance Analysis', ['Ilie  Fishtik'], u'2009-01-14', u'Background: Flux balance and network-based pathway analyses are theoretical tools aimed to find optimal steady state flux distributions in a metabolic network subject to additional constraints on the rates of the reaction steps. Although these methods are mathematically accurate, there are several physicochemical and computational aspects that are questionable and misleading. In particular, it is well known that the flux balance analysis may result in multiple flux distributions for the same objective function.  Results: The flux balance and network-based pathway analyses are reformulated in terms of reaction routes (RRs), a theoretical framework that has been developed by Horiuti over 50 years ago. Not only does the theory of RRs provide the most general and rigorous definition of a pathway, but it also relates the steady state rates of the reaction steps with the rates along RRs or pathways. In this work, we employ the simple relation between the steady state rates of the reaction steps and the rates along RRs (fluxes) established by Horiuti to eliminate the steady state constraints.  Conclusion: The newly proposed RR approach represents a powerful tool for a deeper understanding of optimal flux distributions in metabolic reaction systems. Application of the RR approach to several typical systems from the literature surprisingly reveals that an infinite number of flux distributions for the same optimal objective function may be a rule rather than the exception', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/2788/version/1', [u'Biotechnology', u'Chemistry', u'Bioinformatics'], [u'Worcester Polytechnic Institute']]
[u'Inverse relationship between genetic diversity and epigenetic complexity', ['Shi Huang'], u'2009-01-13', u'Early studies of molecular evolution revealed a correlation between genetic distance and time of species divergence.  This observation provoked the molecular clock hypothesis and in turn the \u2018Neutral Theory\u2019, which however remains an incomplete explanation since it predicts a constant mutation rate per generation whereas empirical evidence suggests a constant rate per year.  Data inconsistent with the molecular clock hypothesis have steadily accumulated in recent years that show no correlation between genetic distance and time of divergence.  It has therefore become a challenge to find a testable idea that can reconcile the seemingly conflicting data sets.  Here, an inverse relationship between genetic diversity and epigenetic complexity was deduced from a simple intuition in building complex systems.  Genetic diversity, i.e., genetic distance or dissimilarity in DNA or protein sequences between individuals or species, is restricted by the complexity of epigenetic programs.  This inverse relationship logically deduces the maximum genetic diversity (MGD) hypothesis, which suggests that macroevolution from simple to complex organisms involves a punctuational increase in epigenetic complexity that in turn causes a punctuational loss in genetic diversity.

Students were asked if they had received serious \u201ctoo fat\u201d or \u201ctoo thin\u201d comments over the past 30 days from family members, peers and professionals, and the accuracy of the comments was assessed against the actual weight status. Weight misperception was defined as discordance between the actual and perceived weight status. Logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odd ratios (ORs) for weight misperception by weight comments received.Results: One in three students received weight comments, most commonly from mother for both \u201ctoo fat\u201d and \u201ctoo thin\u201d comments. Health professional was the most accurate source of weight comments, yet less than half the comments were correct. Receiving incorrect weight comments was significantly associated with weight misperception in all sex-weight status sub-groups, particularly among obese girls. In contrast, student who received correct weight comments were less likely to have weight misperception.Conclusions: Weight comments were commonly received by Chinese adolescents in Hong Kong, yet most of the comments were inaccurate, and such incorrect comments were associated with weight misperception. Family members, peers and professionals should realize the potential adverse effects of their weight comments and adolescents should be taught how to correctly assess their weight status to reduce misperceptions.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/2742/version/1', [u'Bioinformatics'], [u'Department of Community Medicine and School of Public Health, University of Hong Kong', u'Department of Community Medicine, University of Hong Kong']]

Used were near isogeneic lines (NILs) that contrasted at their rhg1 alleles. Features of the rhg1 locus, the candidate genes and their nascent transcripts and proteins in roots were elucidated. First, evidence for a syntenic gene cluster was found and the effectiveness of SNP probes for distinguishing the homeolog sequence variant on linkage group (Lg) B1 from alleles at the rhg1 locus on Lg G was shown. Analysis of plant s heterozygous at rhg1 showed that the allele for resistance was dominant. The absence of recombination events among the NILs between the RLK and other 2 genes eliminated the possibility of a monogeneic rhg1 locus. Finally, an effect on root development was discovered.

[u'The Entropic Landscape of proteins revealing protein folding mechanism', ['Kentaro Onizuka'], u'2008-12-25', u'It has long since been a mystery why most proteins fold within a flash of time into particular structures out of astronomically large numbers of possible conformations. Even more confusing is that protein folding in vivo is played out in rich solution containing various organic and non-organic, big and small molecules and ions which would potentially bind the protein molecules and prevent them folding. A possible answer to these mysteries might be, \u201cNature have favoured such proteins that quickly fold in rich solution through natural selection\u201d. Then what mechanism of folding has been favoured? Here I show how to decipher protein sequences to reveal the folding mechanism. The entropic landscape of a protein sequence tells which region of the sequence sets out to fold first which next and last. Each step of the folding procedure is programmed in the sequence. This make it clear why proteins fold quickly and escape from surrounding molecules and ions. The folding pathways represented by the entropic landscape agree with the pathways experimentally proposed. Besides, the simulation of protein folding scheduled by the entropic landscape generates native-like conformations, where the lower the entropy of a sequential region is the earlier its conformation is optimized in terms of energy minimization. The attempt to simulate protein folding gives further insights into the folding mechanism.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/2719/version/1', [u'Biotechnology', u'Molecular Cell Biology', u'Bioinformatics'], [u'PsiPhiFoldings Co.

[u'The genetic equidistance result of molecular evolution is independent of mutation rates', ['Shi Huang'], u'2008-11-24', u'The well-established genetic equidistance result shows that sister species are approximately equidistant to a simpler outgroup as measured by DNA or protein dissimilarity.  The equidistance result is the most direct evidence, and remains the only evidence, for the constant mutation rate interpretation of this result, known as the molecular clock.  However, data independent of the equidistance result have steadily accumulated in recent years that often violate a constant mutation rate.  Many have automatically inferred non-equidistance whenever a non-constant mutation rate was observed, based on the unproven assumption that the equidistance result is an outcome of constant mutation rate.  Here it is shown that the equidistance result remains valid even when different species can be independently shown to have different mutation rates.  A random sampling of 50 proteins shows that nearly all proteins display the equidistance result despite the fact that many proteins have non-constant mutation rates.  Therefore, the genetic equidistance result does not necessarily mean a constant mutation rate.  Observations of different mutation rates do not invalidate the genetic equidistance result.  New ideas are needed to explain the genetic equidistance result that must grant different mutation rates to different species and must be independently testable.

[u'PocketMatch: A new algorithm to compare binding sites in protein structures', ['Yeturu Kalidas', 'Nagasuma Chandra'], u'2008-11-21', u'Background: Recognizing similarities and deriving relationships among protein molecules is a fundamentalrequirement in present-day biology. Similarities can be present at various levels which can be detected through comparison of protein sequences or their structural folds. In some cases similarities obscure at these levels could be present merely in the substructures at their binding sites. Inferring  functional similarities between protein molecules by comparing their binding sites is still largely exploratory and not as yet a routine protocol. One ofthe main reasons for this is the limitation in the choice of appropriate analytical tools that can compare binding sites with high sensitivity. To benefit from the enormous amount of structural data that is being rapidly accumulated, it is essential to have high throughput tools that enable large scale binding site comparison.Results: Here we present a new algorithm PocketMatch for comparison of binding sites in a frame invariantmanner. Each binding site is represented by 90 lists of sorted distances capturing shape and chemical nature of the site. The sorted arrays are then aligned using an incremental alignment method and scored to obtain PMScores for pairs of sites. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis and an extensive validation of the algorithm have been carried out. Perturbation studies where the geometry of a given site was retained but the residue types were changed randomly, indicated that chance similarities were virtually non-existent. Our analysis also demonstrates that shape information alone is insufficient to discriminate between diverse binding sites, unlesscombined with chemical nature of amino acids.Conclusions: A new algorithm has been developed to compare binding sites in accurate, efficient andhigh-throughput manner. Though the representation used is conceptually simplistic, we demonstrate that alongwith the new alignment strategy used, it is sufficient to enable binding comparison with high sensitivity. Novel methodology has also been presented for validating the algorithm for accuracy and sensitivity with respect to geometry and chemical nature of the site. The method is also fast and takes about 1/250th second for one comparison on a single processor.

Without electrical symbolism, it is very likely that our industrial society would not have evolved at the same pace. Similarly, specialised notations such as the Feynmann notation or the process flow diagrams did a lot for the adoption of concepts in their own fields. With the advent of Systems Biology, and more recently of Synthetic Biology, the need for precise and unambiguous descriptions of biochemical interactions has become more pressing. While some ideas have been advanced over the last decade, with a few detailed proposals, no actual community standard has emerged. The Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN) is a graphical representation crafted over several years by a community of biochemists, modellers and computer scientists. Three orthogonal and complementary languages have been created, the Process Diagrams, the Entity Relationship Diagrams and the Activity Flow Diagrams. Using these three idioms a scientist can represent any network of biochemical interactions, which can then be interpreted in an unambiguous way.

Goldsmith', 'Saurabh Mendiratta', 'Radha Akella', 'Kathleen Dahlgren'], u'2008-09-19', u'Motivation: With the tremendous growth in scientific literature, it is necessary to improve upon the standard pattern matching style of the available search engines. Semantic NLP may be the solution to this problem. Cognition Search (CSIR) is a natural language technology. It is best used by asking a simple question that might be answered in textual data being queried, such as MEDLINE. CSIR has a large English dictionary and semantic database. Cognition\u2019s semantic map enables the search process to be based on meaning rather than statistical word pattern matching and, therefore, returns more complete and relevant results. The Cognition Search engine uses downward reasoning and synonymy which also improves recall. It improves precision through phrase parsing and word sense disambiguation.Result: Here we have carried out several projects to \u201cteach\u201d the CSIR lexicon medical, biochemical and molecular biological language and acronyms from curated web-based free sources. Vocabulary from the Alliance for Cell Signaling (AfCS), the Human Genome Nomenclature Consortium (HGNC), the United Medical Language System (UMLS) Meta-thesaurus, and The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) was introduced into the CSIR dictionary and curated. The resulting system was used to interpret MEDLINE abstracts.  Meaning-based search of MEDLINE abstracts yields high precision (estimated at >90%), and high recall (estimated at >90%), where synonym information has been encoded.

Dibutyltin (DBT) is used as stabilizer in the production of polyvinyl chloride plastics, and it is also the major metabolite formed from tributyltin (TBT) in vivo. DBT is immunotoxic, however, the responsible targets remain to be defined. Due to the importance of glucocorticoids in immune-modulation, we investigated whether DBT could interfere with glucocorticoid receptor (GR) function.Methodology. We used HEK-293 cells transiently transfected with human GR as well as rat H4IIE hepatoma cells and native human macrophages and human THP-1 macrophages expressing endogenous receptor to study organotin effects on GR function. Docking of organotins was used to investigate the binding mechanism.  Principal findings. We found that nanomolar concentrations of DBT, but not other organotins tested, inhibit ligand binding to GR and its transcriptional activity. Docking analysis indicated that DBT inhibits GR activation allosterically by inserting into a site close to the steroid-binding pocket, which disrupts a key interaction between the A-ring of the glucocorticoid and the GR. DBT inhibited glucocorticoid-induced expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and tyrosine-aminotransferase (TAT) and abolished the glucocorticoid-mediated transrepression of TNF-\u03b1-induced NF-\u03baB activity. Moreover, DBT abrogated the glucocorticoid-mediated suppression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and TNF-\u03b1 production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated native human macrophages and human THP-1 macrophages.Conclusions. DBT inhibits ligand binding to GR and subsequent activation of the receptor. By blocking GR activation, DBT may disturb metabolic functions and modulation of the immune system, providing an explanation for some of the toxic effects of this organotin.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/2312/version/1', [u'Immunology', u'Pharmacology', u'Bioinformatics'], [u'Division of Molecular and Systems Toxicology, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Basel, Klingelbergstrasse 50, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland', u'Department of Bioengineering, University of California, San Diego, 9500 Gilman Drive, La Jolla, CA 92093-0693, U.S.A.', u'Department of Medicine, 0693 University of California, San Diego, 9500 Gilman Drive, La Jolla, CA 92093-0693, U.S.A.']]

Smith', 'Nadereh  Mir-Rashed', 'Md  Alamgir', 'Veronika  Eroukova', 'Frank Dehne', 'James  J. Cheetham'], u'2008-09-18', u'BackgroundHigh throughput yeast functional genomics experiments are revealing associations among tens to hundreds of genes using numerous experimental conditions. To fully understand how the identified genes might be involved in the observed system, it is essential to consider the widest range of biological annotation possible. Biologists often start their search by collating the annotation provided for each protein within databases such as the Saccharomyces Genome Database, manually comparing them for similar features, and empirically assessing their significance. Such tasks can be automated, and more precise calculations of the significance can be determined using established probability measures. ResultsWe developed Yeast Features, an intuitive online tool to help establish the significance of finding a diverse set of shared features among a collection of yeast proteins. A total of 18,786 features from the Saccharomyces Genome Database are considered, including annotation based on the Gene Ontology\u2019s molecular function, biological process and cellular compartment, as well as conserved domains, protein-protein and genetic interactions, complexes, metabolic pathways, phenotypes and publications. The significance of shared features is estimated using a hypergeometric probability, but novel options exist to improve the significance by adding background knowledge of the experimental system. For instance, increased statistical significance is achieved in gene deletion experiments because interactions with essential genes will never be observed. We further demonstrate the utility by suggesting the functional roles of the indirect targets of an aminoglycoside with a known mechanism of action, and also the targets of an herbal extract with a previously unknown mode of action. The identification of shared functional features may also be used to propose novel roles for proteins of unknown function, including a role in protein synthesis for YKL075C.ConclusionsYeast Features (YF) is an easy to use web-based application (http://software.dumontierlab.com/yeastfeatures/) which can identify and prioritize features that are shared among a set of yeast proteins.

However, this peptide-centric method has its own disadvantages such as the immense volume of tandem Mass Spectrometry (MS) data for sequencing peptides. With the fast development of technology, it is possible to investigate other alternative techniques.  Peptide Mass Fingerprinting (PMF) has been widely used to identify single purified proteins for more than 15 years. Unfortunately, this technique is less accurate than peptide sequencing method and cannot handle protein mixtures, which hampers the widespread use of PMF technique. If we can remove these limitations, PMF will become a useful tool in protein mixture identification. Results: We first formulate the problem of PMF protein mixture identification as an optimization problem. Then, we show that the use of some simple heuristics enables us to find good solutions. As a result, we obtain much better identification results than previous methods. Moreover, the result on real MS data can be comparable with that of the peptide sequencing method. Through a comprehensive simulation study, we identify a set of limiting factors that hinder the performance of PMF method in protein mixtures. We argue that it is feasible to remove these limitations and PMF can be a powerful tool in the analysis of protein mixtures.

Both tests are exact, and do not use any asymptotic considerations, thus producing more correct results for low frequency tags than the chi-square test. The frequentist test uses a tag-customized critical level which minimizes a linear combination of type I and type II errors.

This question continues to elude the neuroimaging field due to at least two kinds of problems: first, the relatively low spatial resolution of fMRI and second, the bias inherent in prevailing statistical methods for analyzing the actual diagnosticity of cortical tissue. We collected high-resolution (1mm x 1mm) imaging data of the fusiform face area (FFA) from 4 subjects while they categorized images as &apos;animal&apos;, &apos;car&apos;, &apos;face&apos;, or &apos;sculpture.&apos; We performed exploratory analysis to determine the nature of the distributions over classes and the similarity structure between classes. The FFA was visualized using nonmetric multidimensional scaling revealing "string-like" sequences of voxels, which appeared in small non-contiguous clusters of categories, intertwined with other categories. Since the feature space appeared highly nonlinear, we trained various statistical classifiers on the class conditional distributions (labelled) and separated the four categories with 100% reliability (over replications) and generalized to out of sample cases with high significance (45% to 51%; p<. 000001, chance=25%). The increased noise inherent in high-resolution neuroimaging data relative to standard resolution resisted any further gains in category performance above 60% (with "FACE" category often having the highest bias per category) even coupled with various feature extraction/selection methods. A sensitivity/diagnosticity analysis for each classifier per voxel showed: (1) reliable (with S.E.<3%) sensitivity present throughout the FFA for all 4 categories, and (2) showed multi-selectivity, that is, many voxels were selective for one category but responded to all 4 categories with some high diagnosticity but at lower intensity. This work further verifies the hypothesis that the FFA is a distributed, object-heterogeneous similarity structure and bolsters the view that the FFA response to "FACE" stimuli in standard resolution may be primarily due to a linear bias, which has resulted from an averaging artifact.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/2235/version/1', [u'Neuroscience', u'Bioinformatics'], [u'Rutgers University, Department of Psychology, Newark, USA', u'Rutgers University, Neuroscience Department, Newark, USA']]

As the shorter a sequence is, the less probable it would be modified during genome evolution. For that reason, some characteristics of very short nucleotide sequences would have considerable chances to persist during billions of years of evolution. Consequently, conservation of certain genomic features of mononucleotides, dinucleotides, and higher-order oligonucleotides across various genomes may exist; some, if not all, of these features would be relics of the primary genetic information. Based on this assumption, we analyzed the pattern of frequencies of mononucleotides, dinucleotides, and higher-order oligonucleotides of the whole-genome sequences from 458 species (including archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes). Also, we studied the phenomenon of strand symmetry in these genomes. The results show that the conservation of frequencies of some dinucleotides and higher-order oligonucleotides across genomes does exist, and that strand symmetry is a ubiquitous and explicit phenomenon that may contribute to frequency conservation.

Oliver', 'Magnus Rattray', 'Casey M. Bergman'], u'2008-07-21', u'Background: Every protein has a variable atomic and energetic cost to the cell based on the synthesis of its constituent amino acids. Quantifying the cost of amino acid synthesis is challenging, however natural selection is expected to favour the use of proteins whose constituents are cheaper to produce in terms of energetic and atomic cost.Results: We develop a systems biology approach to estimate the cost of amino acid synthesis based on genome-scale metabolic models, and directly investigate the effects of the cost of amino acid synthesis on transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic data in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We used our two new and six previously reported measures of amino acid cost in conjunction with codon usage bias, tRNA gene number and atomic composition to identify the factors that predict transcript, protein and free amino acid levels in the yeast cell. While most previously reported cost measures are highly correlated, we find that our systems approach to formulating the cost of amino acid synthesis produces a novel measure of cost, which explains similar levels of variation in gene expression. Regardless of the measure used, the cost of amino acid synthesis is weakly associated with transcript and protein levels, independent of codon usage bias. In contrast, energetic costs explain a large proportion of variation in levels of free amino acids.Conclusions:  In the economy of the yeast cell, the cost of amino acid synthesis correlates with transcript and protein levels to a lesser degree than translational optimisation, whereas atomic and energetic cost plays a much larger role in explaining levels in free amino acids. However, as there appears to be no single currency to compute the cost of amino acid synthesis, a systems approach is necessary to uncover the full effects of amino acid biosynthetic cost in complex biological systems that vary with cellular and environmental conditions.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/1841/version/2', [u'Genetics & Genomics', u'Molecular Cell Biology', u'Bioinformatics'], [u'Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester', u'Biological Research Centre of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences', u'Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge', u'School of Computer Sciences, University of Manchester']]

Aitchison\u2019s compositional distance was used to calculate vectors for each possibility of allocation in a covariate adaptive method. Two different procedures were designed to allocate patients in small blocks or sequentially one-by-one. Partial results of this allocation procedure as well as simulated ones are shown. In the clinical trial for which this procedure was developed, the balancing between treatment arms was achieved successfully. Simulations of results considering different arrival order of patients showed that most of the patients are allocated in a different treatment arm if arrival order is modified.

Previous work has shown how these distributions can be accounted for by simple models, where the main ingredients are probabilities of duplication, innovation, and loss of domains. However, no one so far has addressed the issue that these distributions follow definite trends depending on protein-coding genome size only.  We present a stochastic duplication/innovation model, falling in the class of so-called Chinese Restaurant Processes, able to explain this feature of the data.  Using only two universal parameters, related to a minimal number of domains and to the relative weight of innovation to duplication, the model reproduces two important aspects: (a) the populations of domain classes (the sets, related to homology classes, containing realizations of the same domain in different proteins) follow common power-laws whose cutoff is dictated by genome size, and (b) the number of domain families is universal and markedly sublinear in genome size. An important ingredient of the model is that the innovation probability decreases with genome size. We propose the possibility to interpret this as a global constraint given by the cost of expanding an increasingly complex interactome.  Finally, we introduce a variant of the model where the choice of a new domain relates to its occurrence in genomic data, and thus accounts for fold specificity.  Both models have general quantitative agreement with data from hundreds of genomes, which indicates the coexistence of the well-known specificity of proteomes with robust self-organizing phenomena related to the basic evolutionary ``moves\u2019\u2019 of duplication and innovation.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/1376/version/2', [u'Genetics & Genomics', u'Bioinformatics', u'Evolutionary Biology'], [u"Universita' di Milano, Dip.

These assemblies of proteins putatively serve as an infection gateway, allowing the virus to take control of the human host by reaching protein pathways and diversified cellular functions in a pronounced and focused way. In particular, HIV-1 utilizes its small number of proteins in a combinatorial manner, exerting a significant influence on pathways that deal with transcriptional, translational and degradation processes. Surprisingly, the small repertoire of HIV proteins also interferes loosely with many signaling and regulation pathways, suggesting that a widespread involvement in such pathways secures the control of the host cell.

To-date, the relative proportions of different metal complexes in aqueous media have only been modelled at chemical equilibrium and there are no quantitative analyses of the approach to equilibrium1. While these models have improved our understanding of how metals are used in biological systems they cannot account for the influence of kinetic factors in metal binding, transport and fate2. Here we have modelled the binding of aluminium in blood serum by the iron transport protein transferrin (Tf) as it is widely accepted that the biological fate of this non-essential metal is not adequately described by experiments, in vitro and in silico, which have consistently demonstrated that at equilibrium 90% of serum Al(III) is bound by Tf3-5. We have coined this paradox &apos;the blood-aluminium problem&apos;6 and herein applied a systems biology approach which utilised well-found assumptions to pare away the complexities of the problem such that it was defined by a comparatively simple set of computational rules and, importantly, its solution assumed significant predictive capabilities. Here we show that our novel computational model successfully described the binding of Al(III) by Tf both at equilibrium and as equilibrium for AlTf was approached. The model provided an explanation of why the distribution of Al(III) in the body cannot be adequately described by its binding and transport by Tf and it highlighted the significance of kinetic in addition to thermodynamic constraints in defining the fate of metal ions in biological systems. This is the first model of non-equilibrium metal binding in a biological system and it should prove to be a valuable predictive tool in furthering our understanding of the bioinorganic chemistry of metals.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/2025/version/1', [u'Chemistry', u'Bioinformatics', u'Earth & Environment'], [u'Keele University, Lennard-Jones Laboratories, UK']]

Traditional definitions, based on atomic contacts or changes in solvent accessibility, tend to over- or underpredict the interface itself and cannot discriminate active from less relevant parts.We here extend a fast, parameter-free and purely geometric definition of protein interfaces and introduce the shelling order of Voronoi facets as a novel measure for an atom\u2019s depth inside the nterface. Our analysis of 54 protein-protein complexes reveals a strong correlation between Voronoi Shelling Order (VSO) and water dynamics. High Voronoi Shelling Order coincides with residues that were found shielded from bulk water fluctuations in a recent molecular dynamics study. Yet, VSO predicts such \u201cdry\u201d residues at dramatically reduced cost and without consideration of forcefields or dynamics. More central interface positions are often also increasingly enriched for hydrophobic residues. Yet, this hydrophobic centering is not universal and does not mirror the far stronger geometric bias of water fluxes. The seemingly complex water dynamics at protein interfaces appears thus largely controlled by geometry. Sequence analysis supports the functional relevance of both dry residues and residues with high VSO, both of which tend to be more conserved. However, upon closer inspection, the spatial distribution of conservation argues against the arbitrary dissection into core or rim  and thus refines previous results.

Mutations at exposed sites would cause micro-adaptations, niche-specialization, and therefore, can be thought to promote K-strategists. Exposing, rather than protecting, conserved sites, is also potentially adaptive because they probably promote macro-adaptive changes. This presumably fits r-strategists: their population dynamics tolerate decreased survival. We found that helix-forming tendencies are greater at evolutionary conserved sites of plant mitochondrial mRNAs than at evolutionary variable sites in a majority (73%) of species\u2013gene combinations. K-strategists preferentially protect conserved sites in short genes, r-strategists protect them most in larger genes. This adaptive scenario resembles our earlier findings in chloroplast genes. Protection levels at various codon positions also display disparity with respect to life history strategies of the plants. Conserved site protection increases overall mRNA folding stabilities for some genes, while decreases it for some others. This contrast exists between homologous genes of r- and K- strategists. Such compensating interactions between variability, mRNA size, codon position, and secondary structure factors within r- and K-strategists are most likely, molecular adaptations of plants belonging to the two extreme life history strategies.

The energy model is general enough that it can be applied to other members of the SH2 family or to new peptides, and the cross-validation results suggest that these energy calculations will be useful for predicting binding interactions.

This review explores the use of other identifiers, such as specimen codes and GenBank accession numbers, to link otherwise disconnected facts in different databases.

Recognizing that a data sharing culture is unlikely to be achieved without policy guidance, some funders and journals have begun to request and require that investigators share their primary datasets with other researchers.  The purpose of this study is to understand the current state of data sharing policies within journals, the features of journals which are associated with the strength of their data sharing policies, and whether the strength of data sharing policies impact the observed prevalence of data sharing. Methods:  We investigated these relationships with respect to gene expression microarray data in the journals that most often publish studies about this type of data.  We measured data sharing prevalence as the proportion of papers with submission links from NCBI\u2019s Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database.  We conducted univariate and linear multivariate regressions to understand the relationship between the strength of data sharing policy and journal impact factor, journal subdiscipline, journal publisher (academic societies vs. commercial), and publishing model (open vs. closed access).Results:  Of the 70 journal policies, 18 (26%) made no mention of sharing publication-related data within their Instruction to Author statements.  Of the 42 (60%) policies with a data sharing policy applicable to microarrays, we classified 18 (26% of 70) as moderately strong and 24 (34% of 70) as strong.Existence of a data sharing policy was associated with the type of journal publisher:  half of all commercial publishers had a policy compared to 82% of journals published by academic society.  All four of the open-access journals had a data sharing policy. Policy strength was associated with impact factor:  the journals with no data sharing policy, a weak policy, and a strong policy had respective median impact factors of 3.6, 4.5, and 6.0.  Policy strength was positively associated with measured data sharing submission into the GEO database:  the journals with no data sharing policy, a weak policy, and a strong policy had median data sharing prevalence of 11%, 19%, and 29% respectively.Conclusion:  This review and analysis begins to quantify the relationship between journal policies and data sharing outcomes and thereby contributes to assessing the incentives and initiatives designed to facilitate widespread, responsible, effective data sharing.

(ii) Intra-residual cross-peak intensities for the H(8/6)n- H(1\u2019/2\u2019/2\u2019\u2019/H3\u2019)n contacts in ssDNAs and ssRNAs are stronger at the 3\u2019-ends in comparison with those at the 5\u2019-ends, suggesting that the dynamics of the nucleobases at the 3\u2019-end are more restricted, whereas those at the 5\u2019-end are more flexible. (iii) This relative NMR found mobility is consistent with the final RMSd calculations of the final NMR-MD structures of ssDNAs and ssRNAs.

Epigenetic silencing is one that has a critical role in stress response. Here we show that in yeast, incomplete silencing increases stochastic noise in gene expression, probably owing to unstable chromatin structure. Telomere position effect is suggested as one mechanism. Expression diversity in a population achieved in this way may render a subset of cells to readily respond to various acute stresses. By contrast, strong silencing tends to suppress noisy expression of genes, in particular those involved in life cycle control. In this regime, chromatin may act as a noise filter for precisely regulated responses to environmental signals that induce huge phenotypic changes such as a cell fate transition.

The model predicts robustly that in low transmission settings drug resistance spreads faster than in high transmission settings, and that in low transmission areas ACTs slows the spread of drug resistance to a partner drug, especially at high coverage rates. This effect decreases exponentially with increasing delay in deploying the ACT and decreasing rates of coverage.

Previously considered examples, such as trophic networks, are just representations of experimentally observed direct interactions. However, species interactions are so rich and complex it is not feasible to directly observe more than a small fraction. In this paper, using data mining techniques, we show how potential interactions can be inferred from geographic data, rather than by direct observation. An important application area for such a methodology is that of emerging diseases, where, often, little is known about inter-species interactions, such as between vectors and reservoirs. Here, we show how using geographic data, biotic interaction networks that model statistical dependencies between species distributions can be used to infer and understand inter-species interactions. Furthermore, we show how such networks can be used to build prediction models. For example, for predicting the most important reservoirs of a disease, or the degree of disease risk associated with a geographical area. We illustrate the general methodology by considering an important emerging disease \u2013 Leishmaniasis. This data mining approach allows for the use of geographic data to construct inferential biotic interaction networks which can then be used to build prediction models with a wide range of applications in ecology, biodiversity and emerging diseases.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/1495/version/1', [u'Ecology', u'Bioinformatics'], [u'Instituto de Ciencias Nucleares, Gravitacion, y Teoria de Campos, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de M\xe9xico', u'Instituto de Biolog\xeda, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de M\xe9xico']]

Searching for recurring patterns in protein contact maps, we found several network motifs, patterns that occur more frequently in experimentally determined protein contact maps than in randomized contact maps with the same properties. Some of these network motifs correspond to sub-structures of alpha helices, including topologies not previously recognized in this context. Other motifs characterize beta-sheets, again some of which appear to be novel. This topological characterization of patterns serves as a tool to characterize proteins, and to reveal a high detailed differences map for comparing protein structures solved by X-ray crystallography, NMR and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Both NMR and MD show small but consistent differences from the crystal structures of the same proteins, possibly due to the pair-wise energy functions used.

Mathematical models, usingthe biochemical reactions and focused on different types of spreading behavior have beenconstructed and analyzed. In this study, we build on these previous models to develop athree-dimensional stochastic model of isotropic spreading of mammalian fibroblasts. The model is composed of three actin remodeling reactions that occur stochastically in space and time and are regulated by membrane resistance forces. Numerical simulations indicate that the model qualitatively captures the experimentally observed isotropic cell spreading behavior. We analyzed the effects of varying branching reaction rates, membrane resistance forces and capping protein concentrations on the dynamics of isotropic spreading. The simulations allowed us to identify the range within which branching reaction rates and membrane force values cooperate to yield isotropic spreading behavior. The model predicts increasing capping protein concentration would lead to a linear decrease in average peripheral velocity. We tested this prediction experimentally using varying concentrations of a pharmacologic agent (Cytochalasin D) that caps growing actin filaments. We find that the experimental results agree with the numerical simulations. Thus, a spatio-temporally complex model made up of a simple set of stochastic reactions near the cell surface, when constrained by membrane forces, can yield deterministic behavior as characterized by isotropic cell spreading.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/62/version/2', [u'Biotechnology', u'Molecular Cell Biology', u'Bioinformatics'], [u'Mount Sinai School of Medicine', u'Columbia University']]

[u'Creatine kinase in energy metabolic signaling in muscle', ['Olav Kongas', 'Johannes H. G. M. van Beek'], u'2007-11-14', u'There has been much debate on the mechanism of regulation of mitochondrial ATP synthesis to balance ATP consumption during changing cardiac workloads. A key role of creatine kinase (CK) isoenzymes in this regulation of oxidative phosphorylation and in intracellular energy transport had been proposed, but has in the mean time been disputed for many years. It was hypothesized that high-energy phosphoryl groups are obligatorily transferred via CK; this is termed the phosphocreatine shuttle. The other important role ascribed to the CK system is its ability to buffer ADP concentration in cytosol near sites of ATP hydrolysis. Almost all of the experiments to determine the role of CK had been done in the steady state, but recently the dynamic response of oxidative phosphorylation to quick changes incytosolic ATP hydrolysis has been assessed at various levels of inhibition of CK. Steady state models of CK function in energy transfer existed but were unable to explain the dynamic response with CK inhibited.The aim of this study was to explain the mode of functioning of the CK system in heart, and in particular the role of different CK isoenzymes in the dynamic response to workload steps. For this purpose we used a mathematical model of cardiac muscle cell energy metabolism containing the kinetics of the key processes of energy production, consumption and transfer pathways. The model underscores that CK plays indeed a dual role in the cardiac cells. The buffering role of CK system is due to the activity of myofibrillar CK (MMCK) while the energy transfer role depends on the activity of mitochondrial CK (MiCK). We propose that this may lead to the differences in regulation mechanisms and energy transfer modes in species with relatively low MiCK activity such as rabbit in comparison with species with high MiCK activity such as rat.The model needed modification to explain the new type of experimental data on the dynamic response of the mitochondria. We submit that building a Virtual Muscle Cell is not possible without continuous experimental tests to improve the model.

[u'Internal ribosomal entry site lacks secondary structure', ['Xuhua Xia'], u'2007-10-23', u'The search for mechanisms of translational regulation has yielded many experimentally identified internal ribosome entry sites (IRES). Because of the lack of sequence similarity among the experimentally IRESs, it is widely assumed that IRESs posses stable secondary structure allowing them to interact with the components of the translation machinery. Contrary to this view, here we show that IRES activity in nine yeast IRESs, mapped to 60 nt immediately upstream of the initiation AUG, is strongly associated with the lack of secondary structure of IRESs. Furthermore, the reverse complements of these IRESs, with their secondary structure more stable than those of the IRESs, exhibit little IRES activity. The generality of this association is exemplified by the observation that, in the natural vpu-env bicistronic mRNA in HIV-1, the mRNA segment (60 nt) immediately upstream of the initiation AUG of env has the weakest secondary structure among all dominant HIV-1 mRNA species.

Consequently, the phase and amplitude of each component of a signal transduction cascade has downstream consequences. ResultsWe report our analysis of alternative transcripts in the leptin signaling pathway which is responsible for the systemic regulation of macronutrient storage and energy balance. We focused on the circadian expression pattern of a critical component of the leptin signaling system, suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3). On an Affymetrix GeneChip 430A2 microarray, this gene is represented by three probe sets targeting different regions within the 3\u2019 end of the last exon. We demonstrate that in murine brown adipose tissue two downstream 3\u2019 probe sets experience circadian baseline oscillation in counter-phase to the upstream probe set. Such differences in expression patterns are a telltale sign of alternative splicing within the last exon of SOCS3. In contrast, all three probe sets oscillated in a common phase in murine liver and white adipose tissue.  This suggests that the regulation of SOCS3 expression in brown fat is tissue specific. Another component of the signaling pathway, Janus kinase (JAK), is directly regulated by SOCS and has alternative transcript probe sets oscillating in counter-phase in a white adipose tissue specific manner.ConclusionWe hypothesize that differential oscillation of alternative transcripts may provide a mechanism to maintain steady levels of expression in spite of circadian baseline variation.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/858/version/1', [u'Molecular Cell Biology', u'Pharmacology', u'Bioinformatics'], [u'Colorado State University', u'Pennington Biomedical Research Center']]

Imperfect vaccines in particular, can play the role and recent work [7] sets to test these ideas experimentally, using the mouse malaria model, Plasmodium chabaudi. To this end the authors evolve parasite lines in immunized and nonimmunized (\u201cna\xefve\u201d) mice using serial passage of infected blood samples. They find parasite lines evolved in immunized mice become more virulent than those evolved in naive mice. Furthermore, this feature persisted even when the evolved strains were transmitted through mosquitoes. Here we develop a mathematical model of parasite dynamics that qualitatively reproduces the experimental results of [7]. Our model accounts for the basic in-host processes: (i) production and depletion of red blood cells (RBC); (ii) immune-modulated parasite growth/ replication, (iii) immune stimulation and clearing of parasite. Besides we introduce multiple parasite strains with variable levels of virulence, and allow random mutations during replication process. The virulence is represented by a single parameter \u2013 immune stimulation threshold. So more virulent strains have higher \u201ctolerance levels\u201d, hence increased RBC depletion (anemia).

Directed networks where links are characterized as positive or negative can be converted to systems of differential equations and analyzed as dynamical systems. Such analyses have shown that networks containing only sign-consistent loops, such as positive feed-forward and feedback loops function as monotone systems that display well-ordered behavior. Perturbations to monotone systems have unambiguous global effects and a predictability characteristic that confers advantages for robustness and adaptability. We find that three intracellular regulatory networks: bacterial and yeast transcriptional networks and a mammalian signaling network contain far more sign-consistent feedback and feed-forward loops than expected for shuffled networks. Inconsistent loops with negative links can be more easily removed from real regulatory networks as compared to shuffled networks. This topological feature in real networks emerges from the presence of hubs that are enriched for either negative or positive links, and is not due to a preference for double negative links in paths.

Enzymes are also compared by enzymatic reaction constants, namely Km and kcat values. Proteins are also studied by binding to different oligonucleotides. Here we suggest a simple experimental method for such a comparison of DNA binding proteins, which we call "nucleic acid-protein fingerprints". The experimental design of the method is based on an use of short oligonucleotides immobilized inside microarray of hydrogel cells \u2013 biochip. As a first stage, we solved a simple experimental task: what is the shortest single strand oligonucleotide to be recognized by protein? We tested binding of oligonucleotides from 2 to 12 bases, and we have obtained unexpected result that tetranucleotide one is long enough for specific protein binding. This 4-mer can contain two universal bases \u2013 5-nitroindole nucleoside analogue (Ni) and only two meaningful bases, like A, G, T and C. The result obtained opens a way for constructing the simplest protein binding microarray. This microarray consists of 16 meaningful dinucleotides, like AA, AG, CT, GG etc. Physical sequences of all the nucleotides were NiNiAA, etc, where Ni is bound to gel through the amino linker. We prepared such an array and tested it for specific binding of several DNA/RNA binding proteins, labeled with fluorescent dyes like Texas Red of Bodipy. We tested RNase A and Binase for binding on the simplest microarray. It contains only 16 units, and there is a significant difference in the binding patterns. The microarray based on 3-mers must contains 64 units and must have much more specificity.

Firstly, site-directed mutagenesis (SDM) was performed to create BamH I site for the inserts; secondly, pWPI LV was dephosphorylated after BamH I digestion; finally, the amounts and ratios of the insert and vector DNA were optimized to increase monomeric ligation.

Here we use a genome-scale model of human cell metabolism to investigate the potential metabolic alterations in cells using net zero ATP glycolysis. We uncover a novel pathway for ATP generation that involves reactions from the serine biosynthesis and one-carbon metabolism pathways. This pathway has a predicted two-fold higher flux rate in cells using net zero ATP glycolysis than those using standard glycolysis and generates twice as much ATP with significantly lower rate of lactate- but higher rate of alanine secretion. Thus, in cells using the standard- or the net zero ATP glycolysis pathways a significant portion of the glycolysis flux is always associated with ATP generation, and the ratio between the flux rates of the two pathways determines the rate of ATP generation and lactate and alanine secretion during glycolysis.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/6123/version/2', [u'Biotechnology', u'Cancer', u'Molecular Cell Biology'], [u'The Cancer Institute of New Jersey', u'Institute for Advanced Study', u'University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine']]

For convenience, this phenomenon is named as "density alteration in non-physiological cells" ( DANCE). DANCE was determined by discontinuous sucrose gradient centrifugation (DSGC), in which cells were separated into several bands. The number and position of the bands in DSGC varied with the change of cell culture conditions, drugs, and physical process, indicating that cell&apos;s response to these factors was associated with alteration of intracellular density. Our results showed that the bands of cells were molecularly different from each other, such as the expression of some mRNAs. For most cells tested, intracellular density usually decreased when the cells were in bad conditions, in presence of drugs, or undergoing pathological changes. However, unlike other tissue cells, brain cells showed increased intracellular density in 24 hrs after the animal death. In addition, DANCE was found to be related to drug resistance, with higher drug-resistance in cells of lower intracellular density. Further study found that DANCE also occurred in microorganisms including bacteria and fungus, suggesting that DANCE might be a sensitive and general response of cells to drugs and environmental change. The mechanisms for DANCE are not clear. Based on our study the following causes were hypothesized: change of metabolism mode, change of cell membrane function, and pathological change. DANCE could be important in medical and biological sciences.

Wood char generally has a limit on material usage because of its non-graphitic structure1, so we developed a new functional wood char by iron-, or nickel-catalyzed carbonization, which has a graphite-like structure with mesopores good for electroconductivity and liquid phase adsorption capacity for macro molecules2-5. However the fine structure of the wood char is still not clear. Here we report more than 70 wt % of iron-catalyzed wood char is filled with chained carbon shells formed by 3~20 defective stacking layers of carbon hexagonal planes, which look like nanometer-sized worms swarm. We name them "carbon shell chains". The discussion of the formation mechanism reveals that the wood cell wall plays an important role for their efficient production. They are stable at 1800 \xbaC under vacuum, but in air, burn under 600 \xbaC, and are perfectly conversed into hydrogen and carbon monoxide in a short time by steam at 900 \xbaC. The control of their decomposition will bring out a new talent in the wood char as a big source of supply for nano-graphite or nano-graphene, for which nanometer size and edge effects have recently attracted considerable attention6.

Using preexisting transgenes and recessive mutations of Drosophila melanogaster, a transgenic population arises with small eyes and a different venation pattern that fulfills the criteria of a new species according to Mayr&apos;s "Biological Species Concept"7,10. The genetic circuit entails the loss of a non-essential transcription factor and the introduction of cryptic enhancers. Subsequent activation of those enhancers causes hybrid lethality. The transition from "transgenic organisms" towards "synthetic species", such as Drosophila synthetica, constitutes a safety mechanism to avoid hybridization with wild type populations and preserve natural biodiversity16-18.

HSR patients developed fever and cutaneous eruptions in the presence or absence of organ involvement within 8 weeks of exposure to carbamazepine (CBZ), phenytoin (PHY) or lamotrigine (LTG). Control patients received AEDs without presenting HSR. We investigated 10 CBZ-HSR (4 presented with Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)), 24 CBZ-controls, 10 PHY-HSR (4 presented with drug-induced liver injury (DILI)), 24 PHY-controls, 6 LTG-HSR (1 SJS and 1 DILI) and 24 LTG-controls. There were 30 Han Chinese individuals (14 HSR patients and 16 controls) in our cohort. LTA toxicity greater than 12.5%\xb12.5% was considered positive. Differences among groups were determined by analysis of variance. In addition, we measured cytokine secretion in the patient sera between 1 month and 3 years after the event. All Han Chinese individuals and 30% of Caucasians were genotyped for HLA-B*1502.A perfect correlation (r=0.92) was observed between positive LTA and clinical diagnosis of DILI and SJS/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). HLA-B*1502 positivity in Han Chinese is a predictor of CBZ-HSR and PHY-HSR. HLA-B*1502-negative Han Chinese receiving only CBZ or a combination of CBZ-PHY tolerated the drug(s) clinically, presenting negative CBZ-LTA and PHY-LTA. However, 3 patients presenting negative CBZ-LTA and PHY-LTA, as well as negative HLA-B*1502, showed positive LTG-LTA (38%, 28% and 25%, respectively), implying that they should not be prescribed LTG. Three patients had LTA positive to both PHY and CBZ, and 3 others had LTA positive to both PHY and LTG. Clinically, all six patients presented HSR to both drugs that they tested positive to (cross-reactivity). Patients were grouped based on the clinical presentation of their symptoms as only rash and fever or a triad that characterizes "true" HSR (rash, fever and DILI or SJS/TEN). Levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were significantly higher in patient sera compared to control sera. More specifically, the highest levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 was measured in patients presenting "true" HSR, as were the apoptotic markers Fas, caspase 8 activity and M30. We concluded that LTA is sensitive for DILI and SJS/TEN regardless of drug or ethnicity. HSR prediction will prevent AED-induced morbidity. In Han Chinese, HLA-B*1502 positivity is a predictor for CBZ-HSR and PHY-HSR. Its negativity does not predict a negative LTG-HSR. There is cross-reactivity between AEDs.

Induced pluripotent stem cells are difficult to maintain in vitro and carry a greater risk of tumor formation. Furthermore, the complexity of maintenance and propagation is especially difficult in the clinic. Adult stem cells can be isolated from several adult tissues and present the possibility of self-transplantation for the clinical treatment of a variety of human diseases. Recently, several ASCs have been successfully isolated and cultured in vitro, including hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) , mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), epidermis stem cells, neural stem cells (NSCs), adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs), islet stem cells, and germ line stem cells. Human mesenchymal stem cells originate mainly from bone marrow, cord blood, and placenta, but epidermis-derived MSCs have not yet been isolated. We isolated small spindle-shaped cells with strong proliferative potential during the culture of human epidermis cells and designed a medium to isolate and propagate these cells. They resembled MSCs morphologically and demonstrated pluripotency in vivo; thus, we defined these cells as human epidermis-derived mesenchymal stem cell-like pluripotent cells (hEMSCPCs).

[u'Some Secrets of Fluorescent Proteins: Distinct Bleaching in Various Mounting Fluids and Photoactivation of cyan fluorescent proteins at YFP-Excitation', ['Johannes Schmid', 'Naila Malkani'], u'2011-04-14', u'BackgroundThe use of spectrally distinct variants of green fluorescent protein (GFP) such as cyan or yellow mutants (CFP and YFP, respectively) is very common in all different fields of life sciences, e.g. for marking specific proteins or cells or to determine protein interactions. In the latter case, the quantum physical phenomenon of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) is exploited by specific microscopy techniques to visualize proximity of proteins.Methodology/Principal FindingsWhen we applied a commonly used FRET microscopy technique \u2013 the increase in donor (CFP)-fluorescence after bleaching of acceptor fluorophores (YFP), we obtained good signals in live cells, but very weak signals for the same samples after fixation and mounting in commercial microscopy mounting fluids. This observation could be traced back to much faster bleaching of CFP in these mounting media. Strikingly, the opposite effect of the mounting fluid was observed for YFP and also for other proteins such as Cerulean, TFP or Venus. The changes in photostability of CFP and YFP were not caused by the fixation but directly dependent on the mounting fluid. Furthermore we made the interesting observation that the CFP-fluorescence intensity increases by about 10 \u2013 15% after illumination at the YFP-excitation wavelength \u2013 a phenomenon, which was also observed for Cerulean. This photoactivation of cyan fluorescent proteins at the YFP-excitation can cause false-positive signals in the FRET-microscopy technique that is based on bleaching of a yellow FRET acceptor.Conclusions/SignificanceOur results show that photostability of fluorescent proteins differs significantly for various media and that  CFP bleaches significantly faster in commercial mounting fluids, while the opposite is observed for YFP and some other proteins. Moreover, we show that the FRET microscopy technique that is based on bleaching of the YFP is prone to artifacts due to photoactivation of cyan fluorescent proteins under these conditions.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/4517/version/2', [u'Biotechnology', u'Molecular Cell Biology'], [u'Medical Univ.

[u'Molecular crowding defines a common origin for the Warburg effect in proliferating cells and the lactate threshold in muscle physiology', ['Alexei Vazquez'], u'2011-03-15', u'Aerobic glycolysis is a seemingly wasteful mode of ATP production that is seen both in rapidly proliferating mammalian cells and highly active contracting muscles, but whether there is a common origin for its presence in these widely different systems is unknown. To study this issue, here we develop a model of human central metabolism that incorporates a solvent capacity constraint of metabolic enzymes and mitochondria, accounting for their occupied volume densities, while assuming glucose and/or fatty acid utilization. The model demonstrates that activation of aerobic glycolysis is favored above a threshold metabolic rate in both rapidly proliferating cells and heavily contracting muscles, because it provides higher ATP yield per volume density than mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. In the case of muscle physiology, the model also predicts that before the lactate switch, fatty acid oxidation increases, reaches a maximum, and then decreases to zero with concomitant increase in glucose utilization, in agreement with the empirical evidence. These results are further corroborated by a larger scale model, including biosynthesis of major cell biomass components. The larger scale model also predicts that in proliferating cells the lactate switch is accompanied by activation of glutaminolysis, another distinctive feature of the Warburg effect. In conclusion, intracellular molecular crowding is a fundamental constraint for cell metabolism in both rapidly proliferating- and non-proliferating cells with high metabolic demand. Addition of this constraint to metabolic flux balance models can explain several observations of mammalian cell metabolism under steady state conditions.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/5784/version/1', [u'Biotechnology', u'Cancer', u'Molecular Cell Biology'], [u'The Cancer Institute of New Jersey and UMDNJ-Robert wood Johnson Medical School']]

However, the currently used protein staining methods represent a serious bottleneck for a quick subsequent protein analysis using mass spectrometry. Substituting traditional protein stains by pre-gel derivatization with visible and mass spectrometry compatible reagents eliminates several processing steps and drastically reduces the sample preparation time. A defined chemistry permits seamless integration of such covalent protein staining methods into standardized bioinformatic pipelines. Using Uniblue A we could covalently stain simple to complex protein samples within 1 minute. Protein profiles on the gels were not compromised and MS/MS based sequence coverages higher than 80% could be obtained.

Intracellular tracking of pDNA showed that cRGD-PEG-PAsp(DET) micelles were internalized via caveolae-mediated endocytosis, which is associated with a pathway avoiding lysosomal degradation, and that PEG-PAsp(DET) micelles were transported to acidic endosomes and lysosomes via clathrin-mediated endocytosis.

In this study, photonuclear reactions in the body of live or dead animals were induced with 50-MeV irradiation. Tissue nuclear reactions were detected by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of the induced beta+ activity. We found the unique tissue "fingerprints" of beta+ (the tremendous difference in beta+ activities and tissue distribution patterns among the individuals) are imprinted in all live animals. Within any individual, the tissue "fingerprints" of 15O and 11C are also very different. When the animal dies, the tissue "fingerprints" are lost. The biochemical, rather than physical, mechanisms could play a critical role in the phenomenon of tissue "fingerprints". Radiolytic radical attack caused millions-fold increases in 15O and 11C activities via different biochemical mechanisms, i.e. radical-mediated hydroxylation and peroxidation respectively, and more importantly the bio-molecular functions (such as the chemical reactivity and the solvent accessibility to radicals).

Human CD8+ CTL and NK cells display high cytotoxicity for pig cells, mediated at least in part by the Fas/FasL pathway. To prevent cell-mediated xenocytotoxicity, a membrane-bound form of human FasL (mFasL) was generated as an inhibitor for CTL and NK cell cytotoxicity that could not be cleaved by metalloproteinase to produce putative soluble FasL. We produced two healthy transgenic pigs harboring the mFasL gene via somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). In a cytotoxicity assay using transgenic clonal cell lines and transgenic pig ear cells, the rate of CD8+ CTL-mediated cytotoxicity was significantly reduced in transgenic pig&apos;s ear cells compared with that in normal minipig fetal fibroblasts.

With the potential application of nanofibers in many industries, especially membrane and filter fabrication, their reproducible production must be established to ensure commercially viability.Cellulose acetate (CA) solution (0.2 g/ml) in a solvent mixture of acetone/DMF/ethanol (2:2:1) was electrospun into nonwoven fibre mesh with the fibre diameter ranging from 150nm to 1\xb5m.The resulting nanofibers were observed and analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), showing a correlation of reducing average fibre diameter with increasing atmospheric temperature. A less pronounced correlation was seen with changes in relative humidity regarding fibre diameter, though it was shown that increased humidity reduced the effect of fibre beading yielding a more consistent, and therefore better quality of fibre fabrication.Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) studies observed lower melt enthalpies for finer CA nanofibers in the first heating cycle confirming the results gained from SEM analysis. From the conditions that were explored in this study the temperature and humidity that gave the most suitable fibre mats for a membrane purpose were 25.0\xb0C and 50%RH due to the highest level of fibre diameter uniformity, the lowest level of beading while maintaining a low fibre diameter for increased surface area and increased pore size homogeneity.

However recent reports have challenged this &apos;direct-activation&apos; hypothesis, suggesting the mechanism by which resveratrol increases SIRT1 function is still unknown. We report for the first time that resveratrol induces a dose dependent increase in activity of the NAD+ synthetic enzyme nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyl transferase (NMNAT1). Activation of NMNAT1 by resveratrol in cultured primary human astrocytes and neurons increased NAD+ levels by up to 5 fold. As SIRT1 requires NAD+ as a substrate to perform its gene silencing function, higher NAD+ levels will enhance SIRT1 activity. This finding suggests that resveratrol may promote SIRT1 function by enhancing NAD+ synthesis in whole cell systems without requiring direct activation.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/4421/version/1', [u'Biotechnology'], [u'University of New South Wales, Pharmacology']]

However, current cellular vaccines are inefficient and there are questions regarding their overall safety. We report a simple and straightforward approach for improving of cellular cancer vaccines. Through treatment of cancer cell cultures with purified protease, it is possible to make preparations of cell-surface antigens that are free of intracellular content and contain two orders-of-magnitude less protein than the whole lysate of an equivalent number of cancer cells. Despite this difference in total protein content, protease-generated preparations stimulate anti-cancer responses from immune cells better those stimulated with cancer cells themselves. The composition of collected cell-surface antigens, prior to vaccination, can be directly compared with antigenic profile of target cancer cells by the proteomic footprinting. Any contaminates (cell parasites, viruses, toxins, prions, etc.) are easily separated from antigens by means of ultrafiltration. Thus, current cellular vaccines may be improved by replacing whole cancer cells with their isolated cell-surface antigens.

While many types of ketoreductase have been extensively studied and their functions, properties and utilities have been well known, the capability of stereoselectively reducing two carbonyl groups in the same diketohexanoate ester molecule to form a dihydroxy product by a single ketoreductase has not been evidently characterized. Here we show that a unique and novel enzyme, diketoreductase, was cloned from Acinetobacter baylyi, heterogeneously expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. The diketoreductase is up to 78% homologous to bacterial 3-hydroxyacyl coenzyme-A reductases.

Drugs are commonly believed to ameliorate illnesses. The targeted, controlled and/or enhanced uptake of the drug into cells is facilitated by loading the drug into carrier vehicles (nanoparticles, e.g.. micelles).The distribution of a drug over the nanoparticles used to deliver the drug to the targeted cells is of vital importance. It makes a difference, whether all nanoparticles carry the same amount of drug or whether a little amount of the nanoparticles carries a high proportion of the drug material and most nanoparticles carry no material.

Furthermore, the absolute amount of drug present in the nanoparticles and the absolute number of nanoparticles loaded with drug molecules is very important, because "dosis venum facit" [Paracelsus].

The costs (be they biological or economic) of building sensors and processing the information they capture become excessive compared to the small advantages that occur from the modifications of behaviour. Many self-organised systems are thought to change their properties as a result of changes in individual behaviour. Here, using both natural systems and computer simulations, we demonstrate that intertidal snail aggregations slightly decrease in size when individuals forage for shorter periods due to hotter and more desiccating conditions \u2013 a non-optimal behaviour for the snails since aggregation reduces desiccation stress.

These results give an indication of the robustness of self-organised systems to changes in individual-level behaviour.

To examine enzyme function in the absence of solvation and bypass diffusional constraints we have tested the ability of an esterase to catalyse alcoholysis as an anhydrous powder, using a closed reaction system in which the substrates and products of the enzyme reaction are gaseous 14-15, and where the water content can be well defined 16. At hydrations equivalent to 3 (\xb12) molecules of water per molecule of enzyme, activity is observed that is several orders of magnitude greater than non-enzymatic catalysis. Neutron spectroscopy indicates that the fast (\u2264nanosecond) global anharmonic dynamics of the anhydrous functional enzyme are heavily suppressed. The results indicate that neither hydration water nor the solvent-activated fast anharmonic dynamics are required for enzyme function. An implication of these results is that one of the essential requirements of water for life may lie with its role as a diffusion medium rather than any of its more specific properties.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/3884/version/1', [u'Biotechnology', u'Chemistry'], [u'University of Waikato', u'BASF', u'Manchester Interdisciplinary Biocentre, Faculty of life science', u'Australian Institute of Nuclear Science and Engineering and University of Wollongong, School of Chemistry and Centre for Medical Bioscience, ', u'University College London, Physics and astronomy', u'UT/ORNL, Center for Molecular Biophysics', u'University of Waikato, Biological Sciences']]

Workers from these colonies use different defence strategies to combat invaders. Nevertheless, some parasitic species are able to bypass primary colony defences due to their morphology and behaviour. In particular, some beetle nest invaders cannot be killed or removed by workers of social bees, thus creating the need for alternative social defence strategies to ensure colony survival. Here we show, using Diagnostic Radioentomology, that stingless bee workers Trigona carbonaria, immediately mummify invading destructive nest parasites Aethina tumida alive, with a mixture of resin, wax and mud, thereby preventing severe damage to the colony. In sharp contrast to the responses of honeybee and bumblebee colonies, the rapid live mummification strategy of T. carbonaria effectively prevents beetle parasite advancements and removes their ability to reproduce. The convergent evolution of live mummification by stingless bees and social encapsulation by honeybees suggests that colonies of social bees generally rely on, secondary defence mechanisms when harmful nest intruders cannot be killed or ejected easily.

Since the composition of the herbal extract called Ob-X has been shown to have both anti-angiogenic and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-inhibiting activities, we hypothesized that growth of adipose tissue can be regulated by Ob-X. Materials and Methods: The effects of Ob-X on angiogenesis and extracellular matrix remodeling were measured using in vitro and ex vivo assays. The effects of Ob-X on adipose tissue growth were investigated with nutritionally obese mice. Results: Ob-X inhibited angiogenesis in a dose-dependent manner in the human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) tube formation assay in vitro and the rat aortic ring assay ex vivo. Ob-X also suppressed MMP activity in vitro. Administration of Ob-X to high fat diet-induced obese mice produced significant reductions in body weight gain and adipose tissue mass, compared to controls. The mass of both subcutaneous (SC) and visceral (VSC) fat was reduced in Ob-X-treated mice. The size of adipocytes in SC and VSC adipose tissues was also significantly reduced in Ob-X-treated mice. Ob-X treatment decreased the blood vessel density and MMP activity in VSC adipose tissues of nutritionally obese mice. Ob-X reduced mRNA levels of angiogenic factors (VEGF-A and FGF-2) and MMPs (MMP-2 and MMP-9), whereas it increased mRNA levels of angiogenesis inhibitors (TSP-1 and TIMP-2) in SC and VSC adipose tissues of nutritionally obese mice. Conclusion: Ob-X, which has anti-angiogenic and MMP-inhibitory activities, reduces adipose tissue mass in nutritionally induced obese mice, providing evidence that adipose tissue growth and development may be prevented by inhibiting angiogenesis. In addition, these data suggest that regulation of adipose tissue growth by inhibiting angiogenesis may alter the expression of genes involved in angiogenesis and the MMP system.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/2970/version/1', [u'Biotechnology'], [u'AngioLab.

[u'Glutathione (GSH) conjugates with dopamine (DA)-derived quinones to form reactive or non-reactive GSH-conjugates', ['Zhidong Zhou', 'Tit Meng Lim'], u'2009-03-21', u'In this study we demonstrate for the first time that GSH could rapidly conjugate with dopamine (DA)-derived DA-o-quinones without enzymatic catalysis to form short-lived intermediate GSH-conjugates (2-S-GSH-DA-o-quinone and 5-S-GSH-DA-o-quinone). These intermediate GSH-conjugates are unstable and would finally form reactive or non-reactive GSH-conjugates dependent on ambient reductive forces. Under insufficient reductive forces, the intermediate GSH-conjugates could cyclize spontaneously to form reactive 7-S-GSH-aminochrome (7-S-GSH-AM). The 7-S-GSH-AM is so reactive that it could further react with another GSH to form 4,7-bi-GSH-5,6-dihydroindole. Its reactivity could also abrogate tyrosinase activity in solutions. In addition, the 7-S-GSH-AM could further undergo internal rearrangement to form non-reactive 7-S-GSH-5,6-dihydroindole.

[u'Intestinal Electric Stimulation Accelerates Whole Gut Transit and Promotes Fat Excrement in Conscious Rats', ['Ying Sun', 'Jiande Chen'], u'2009-02-05', u'Introduction: Intestinal electric stimulation (IES) is proposed as a potential tool for the treatment of morbid obesity. Our previous study showed that IES with one pair of electrodes accelerated intestinal transit and decreased fat absorption in a segment of the jejunum in the anesthetized rats. The aims of this study were to assess the effects of IES on the whole gut transit and fat absorption in conscious rats, to examine the effects of multi-channel IES, and to explore the cholinergic mechanism behind the effects of IES. Methods: Thirty-eight male rats implanted with serosal electrodes were randomized into five groups: control without IES, 2/3 channel IES with short pulses, atropine and atropine plus IES. The whole gut transit and fat remained and emptied from the gut were analyzed after continuous 2-hour IES. Results: Two and three channel IES significantly accelerated phenol red (marker used for transit) excretion (ANOVA, P < 0.001). No significant difference was found between two and three channel IES. Two channel IES significantly increased the excretion of fat (P < 0.05). Atropine significantly blocked the accelerated transit induced by IES (ANOVA, P < 0.001). Correlation was found between the percentage of phenol red and fat retained in the whole gut (r = 0.497, P < 0.01). Conclusions: IES accelerates whole gut transit and promotes fat excrement in conscious rats, and these effects are mediated through the cholinergic nerves. These findings are in support of the concept that IES may be a promising treatment option for obesity.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/2854/version/1', [u'Biotechnology'], [u'Johns Hopkins University, School of Medicine ', u'University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, Division of Gastroenterology']]
[u'Emergence and Fixing of Antiviral Resistance in Influenza A Via Recombination and Hitch Hiking', ['Henry L. Niman'], u'2009-01-29', u'The dramatic rise of oseltamivir resistance in the H1N1 serotype in the 2007/2008 season and the fixing of H274Y in the 2008/2009 season has raised concerns regarding individuals at risk for seasonal influenza, as well as development of similar resistance in the H5N1 serotype.  Previously, oseltamivir resistance produced changes in H1N1 and H3N2 at multiple positions in treated patients.  In contrast, the recently reported resistance involved patients who had not recently taken oseltamivir.  Moreover, the resistance was limited to the H1N1 which had acquired H274Y.  Using phylogenetic analysis I show that the fixing of H274Y was due to hitch hiking on a genetic background that acquired key changes from another circulating sub-clade.  H274Y jumped from clade 2C (Hong Kong/2562/2006-like) to clade 1 (New Caledonia/20/1999-like) to clade 2B (Brisbane/59/2007-like) which included multiple introductions. Sub-clades that had acquired key changes on the neuramindase and hemagglutinin genes expanded and fixed of H274Y on H1N1.  These changes led to the spread of adamantane resistance on clade 2C outside of Asia, followed by the spread of oseltamivir resistance in 2007/2008 and the fixing of H274Y in 2008/2009.  The hemagglutinin change, A193T, was a key component and the coincident polymorphism, S193F, was linked to the fixing of adamantane resistance in H3N2.  The aggregation of key polymorphisms onto different genetic backgrounds supports a mechanism of homologous recombination between co-circulating influenza sub-clades, and provides a rationale for the prediction of vaccine targets and emergence of antiviral resistance.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/2832/version/1', [u'Biotechnology', u'Genetics & Genomics', u'Immunology'], [u'Recombinomics, Inc.']]

There is little information on the phylogenetic relationships between its global accessions and species. Assessing genetic variation by RAPD, AFLP and combinatorial tubulin based polymorphism (cTBP) in 38 J. curcas accessions from 13 countries on 3 continents revealed narrow genetic diversity. However, 6 different species of Jatropha from India exhibited pronounced genetic diversity indicating possibilities of improving J. curcas by interspecific breeding. The relatively unexplored cTBP approach we used was a highly efficient and cost effective genotyping tool. Using such tools towards breeding J. curcas for low phorbol ester (PE) content is highly desirable because of the co-carcinogenic nature of the PEs present in all the commercially relevant parts such as seeds, seed-cake and biodiesel. We report initial success in obtaining interspecific F1 and back cross (BC1) plants with low PE and improved agronomic traits.Further efforts will lead to generating varieties with targeted traits. Despite the limited genetic diversity within J. curcas accessions, appreciable variability was noticed in important phenotypic, physiological and biochemical traits such as seed size, water use efficiency and seed oil content respectively.

Hypothesis: The nitroimidazole induced metabolic energy loss and oxygen depletion (hypoxia) in liver cell mitochondria causes the phagocytosis.  Based on it, ten control subjects with 2\u2019-nitroimidazole therapy were studied for their carbohydrate metabolizing enzymes in serum and hepatocellular enzymes in liver biopsy tissues.  Materials and Methods: Proven ten control subjects were studied for hypoxia by enzyme assays.  The 2\u2019nitroimidazole treated paired ten subjects were studied for hypoxia using enzyme assays and hepatocellular cytomorphology by electron microscopy. Results and Discussion: Out of ten subjects on 2\u2019-nitroimidazole, nine showed elevated carbohydrate metabolizing and lysosomal enzyme levels in serum. The enzymes glucokinase (in 80% samples), aldolase (in 80% samples), phosphofructokinase (in 80% samples), malate dehydrogenase (in 75% samples), isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) (in 60% patients) were elevated while succinate dehydrogenase and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels remained unaltered.   Lysosomal enzymes \u03b2-glucuronidase, alkaline phosphatase, acid phosphatase, showed enhanced levels in the serum samples.  In control ten liver biopsies, the hepatocytes and Kupffer cell preparations showed altered enzyme levels.  Hepatocytes showed lowered glucokinase (in 80%), LDH (in 80%), and higher content of aldolase (in 80%), pyruvate kinase (in 100%), malate dehydrogenase (in 80%), ICDH (in 80%), citrate dehydrogenase (in 70%), phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (in 80%).  Kupffer cells showed higher enzyme levels of \u03b2-glucuroronidase (in 80%), leucine aminopeptidase (in 70%), acid phosphatase (in 80%) and aryl sulphatase (in 88%).  In these 10 biopsy samples from subjects on 2\u2019-nitronidazole clinical trial, the electron microscopy cytomorphology observations showed swollen bizarre mitochondria, proliferative endoplasmic reticulum, and anisonucleosis after 2\u2019-Nitroimidazole effect in liver cell damage.

Here, we utilize different enzymatic reactions in b-lactam acylase to figure out the substrate/product trajectories in the enzyme, thereby probing the overall conformational changes in transition state. First, an auto-proteolytic intermediate of cephalosporin acylase (EC 3.5.1.11) with partial spacer segment was identified. As a final proteolytic step, the deletion of this spacer segment was revealed to be a first-order reaction, suggesting an intramolecular Ntn mechanism for the auto-proteolysis. Accordingly, the different proteolytic sites in the acylase precursor indicate a substrate entering pathway along the spacer peptide. Second, bromoacyl-7ACA can interact with penicillin G acylase (EC 3.5.1.11) in two distinguish aspects, to be hydrolyzed as a substrate analogue and to affinity alkylate the conserved Trpb4 as a product analogue. The kinetic correlation between these two reactions suggests a channel opening from Serb1 to Trpb4, responsible for the main product leaving.

The RAPD analysis was also intended to identify molecular markers, specific to the species to develop PCR-based markers for detection of Xcmi in mango field and planting materials. Twenty RAPD primers (CP 1-CP 20) were evaluated to establish molecular characters and genetic variability in the genome of Xcmi. Among these, only 4 were found efficient for development of reproducible banding pattern. It has been observed that the largest and smallest amplified RAPD products were of 2.036 and 0.201 kbp. A total of 136 bands were scored against 6 strains of Xcmi. There was 7.66 per cent polymorphism in individual isolates which indicates significant polymorphism among the evaluated strains, with mean difference of 0.33 (Xcmi 2 vs. Xcmi 8) and 0.29 (Xcmi 10 vs. Xcmi 12). However, the single linkage euclidean distances were statistically significant (P>0.05), i.e., 0.58. The markers CP 5, 10, 16 and 19 were amplified in all the strains with polymorphic alleles, which indicates that these markers could be used for rapid detection of genetic variability in Xcmi strains.

Here we simply synthesize intrinsically self-stabilized nanofibril bundles of poly(1-anthraquinoylamine) (PAQ) by a template-free method. The critical polymerization parameters were studied to significantly optimize the synthesis, size, properties, and functionalities of the resulted fine nanofibrils with a diameter of ca. 30 nm and length of ~6 \u03bcm. The PAQ obtained with ammonium persulfate possesses higher polymerization yield, purer composition, higher conductivity, better melting behaviour, higher thermostability, lower burning enthalpy, and slower degradation than that with other oxidants. Furthermore, the polymer nanofibrils exhibit high self-stability, powerful redispersibility, high purity, and clean surface because of a complete avoidance of the contamination from external stabilizer. The PAQ exhibits widely controllable conductivity moving across ten orders of magnitudes from 10-9 to 50 S/cm, photoluminescence, lead-ion adsorbability, very high thermostability in air and extremely high char yield in nitrogen at 1000\u02daC.

To avoid the risk of dissemination of antibiotic resistance markers, we developed a new system to produce a family of plasmids Free of Antibiotic Resistance genes, called pFARs. The strategy is based on the suppression of a chromosomal nonsense mutation by a plasmid-borne function. The amber mutation was introduced into the Escherichia coli thyA gene that encodes a thymidylate synthase required for dTMP synthesis, resulting in thymidine auxotrophy. In parallel, a small plasmid vector that carries an amber suppressor t-RNA gene was entirely synthesised. The introduction of pFAR plasmids into an optimised thyA mutant restored normal growth to the auxotrophic strain, and led to an efficient production of monomeric supercoiled plasmids, as required for clinical trials. Luciferase activities measured after intramuscular injection and electrotransfer of LUC-encoding pFAR vector were similar to those obtained with a commercial vector containing the same expression cassette. Interestingly, whereas luciferase activities decreased within three weeks after intradermal electrotransfer of conventional expression vectors, sustained levels were observed with the pFAR derivative. Thus, pFAR plasmids represent a novel family of biosafe eukaryotic expression vectors, suitable for gene therapy.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/2395/version/1', [u'Biotechnology', u'Genetics & Genomics'], [u'INSERM U640', u'Universite Catholique de Louvain', u'Inserm U640']]

Although weight loss during sleep is a well-known phenomenon, it has not yet been studied in relation to sleep structure or autonomic tonus during sleep. Our study is proposed to be a first step in assessing the relationship between overnight weight loss, sleep structure, and HRV (heart rate variability) parameters.Methods: Twenty-five healthy volunteers received a 487 kcal meal and 200 ml water before experiment. Volunteers were weighed before and after polysomnography. Absolute and relative weight indices were calculated. Time and frequency domain analysis of heart rate variability was assessed during stages 2, 4, and REM. Nonparametric linear regression analysis was performed between night weight loss parameters, polysomnographic, and HRV ariables. Results: HF correlated positively with weight loss during stage 4. Slow wave sleep duration correlated positively with weight loss and weight loss rate. The duration of Stage 2 correlated negatively with absolute and relative weight loss.

[u'Efficient polyethylenimine-mediated gene delivery proceeds via a caveolar pathway in HeLa cells.', ['Nathan P. Gabrielson', 'Daniel W. Pack'], u'2008-09-05', u'Most in vivo gene therapies will require cell-specific targeting. Although vector targeting through ligand attachment has met with success in generating gene delivery particles that are capable of specific cellular interactions, little attention has been given to the possible effects of such ligands on subsequent intracellular processing. In this study, we examine the impact of targeting two distinct endocytic routes-the caveolar and clathrin pathways-on polyethylenimine-mediated gene delivery in HeLa cells. Targeting complexes to the caveolar pathway with folic acid and the clathrin pathway with transferrin yields enhanced gene delivery relative to unmodified polyethylenimine. Colocalization studies with caveolin-1 and clathrin heavy chain indicate that the ligands successfully deliver their cargo to the intended pathways. However, inhibition of only the caveolar pathway-whether through the use of small molecule drugs or RNA interference-reduces gene delivery efficiency, suggesting that successful polyethylenimine-mediated gene delivery proceeds via a caveolar pathway in HeLa cells. Transfections in the presence of chloroquine and pH tracking studies suggest that a contributing factor to the success of the caveolar pathway is avoidance of lysosomes. Collectively, these data demonstrate that uptake mechanism and subsequent endocytic processing are important design parameters for gene delivery materials.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/2262/version/1', [u'Biotechnology', u'Cancer'], [u'University of Illinois, Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering']]

Design: In a cross-sectional study, we examined 909 young Korean men (mean\xb1SD age, 24.0\xb12 years) who were healthy and not taking any medications affecting blood pressure, glucose, or lipids concentrations. Body fatness, resting blood pressures, and fasting blood levels of lipids, glucose, and insulin were measured with our standardized laboratory protocols. CRF was quantified as the maximum volume of minute oxygen consumption measured during a graded treadmill test. Metabolic syndrome was defined with the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria and a modified cut-off value of waist circumference from the Asia-Pacific Perspective: Redefining Obesity and its Treatment. Results: Group analyses showed significant and inverse dose-response trends between the metabolic syndrome markers and CRF levels such that men with high and moderate CRF levels had more favorable profiles in body fatness, resting blood pressures, mean values in fasting lipids, glucose, and insulin, and homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance than men with low CRF level. After adjusting for several potential confounders such as age, smoking, and body fatness variables, the low and moderate CRF groups had odds of 4.64 (95% CI, 2.00 to 10.79) and 2.57 (95% CI, 1.04 to 6.34) for having metabolic syndrome than the high CRF group.

In the present work, we demonstrate that a previously unknown secondary water pore is formed inside a ClC exchanger by using an atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. From the systematic simulations, it was determined that the glutamate residue exposed to the intracellular solution, E203, plays an important role as a trigger for the formation of the secondary water pore.

Currently no antidote is available to rescue poisoned synapses. BoNT acts specifically by blocking neurotransmission primarily at peripheral nerve-muscle junctions causing severe flaccid muscle paralysis, which is fatal if proper medical care is not provided. The neurotoxin acts by specifically entering the presynaptic nerve endings where it interferes with the biochemical machinery involved in the process of neurotransmitter release, i.e., neuroexocytosis. Most serotypes of BoNT are known to remain active for weeks to months after entering the nerves, but BoNT/A is the most potent and long lasting in causing muscle paralysis. An effective medical countermeasure strategy requires developing a drug that could rescue poisoned neuromuscular synapses, and would include its efficient delivery specifically to presynaptic nerve terminals. Here we report rescuing of botulinum poisoned nerve cells by Mastoparan-7 (Mas-7), a peptide constituent of bee venom, that was delivered through a drug delivery vehicle (DDV) constructed from the non-toxic fragment of botulinum neurotoxin itself. We found that Mas-7 that was delivered into BoNT/A intoxicated cultured mouse spinal cord cells restored over 40% of stimulated neurotransmitter release. The rescue of the cell poisoning did not occur from inhibition of the endopeptidase activity of BoNT/A against its well known substrate, SNAP-25 that is mechanistically involved in the exocytosis process. Rather, Mas-7 induced a physiological host response apparently unrelated to SNAP-25, but linked to the phospholipase signal transduction pathway. In addition to providing the first effective antidote against botulism, our results open new avenues to study the mechanism of exocytosis, and also to examine an alternative cellular mechanism of botulinum neurotoxin action.

The method, which involves selective ozonolysis of the C-C double bond in ceramide moiety and subsequent enrichment of generated GSL-aldehydes by chemical ligation using aminooxy-functionalized gold nanoparticle (aoGNP) should be of widespread utility for identifying and characterizing whole GSLs present in the living cell surfaces. The present protocol using glycoblotting permitted MALDI-TOFMS-based high throughput structural profiling of mouse brain gangliosides such as GM1, GD1a/GD1b, and GT1b for adult or GD3 in case for embryonic mouse. When mouse melanoma B16 cells were subjected to this protocol, it was demonstrated that gangliosides enriched from the plasma membranes are only GM3 bearing microheteogeneity in the structure of N-acyl chain. Surface plasmon resonance analysis revealed that aoGNP displaying whole GSLs blotted from mouse B16 melanoma cell surfaces can be used directly for monitoring specific interaction with self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of Gg3Cer (gangliotriaosylceramide). Our results indicate that GSL-selective enrichment onto aoGNP from living cell surfaces allows for rapid reconstruction of plasma membrane models mimicking intact GSL-microdomain feasible for further structural and functional characterization.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/2034/version/1', [u'Biotechnology', u'Chemistry'], [u'Hokkaido University, Biological Sciences', u'Hokkaido University, ', u'Hokkaido University, Advanced Life Science']]

Degradation of denuded collagen within dentin adhesive resin-infiltrated dentin is a pertinent problem in dentin bonding. Here, we show that GTR provides a means of salvaging these degrading bonds by remineralizing resin-dentin interfaces. The GTR medium consists of a Portland cement/simulated body fluid that includes polyacrylic acid and polyvinylphosphonic acid biomimetic analogs for amorphous calcium phosphate dimension regulation and collagen targeting. Both interfibrillar and intrafibrillar apatites became readily discernible within the adhesive-bonded dentin after 2-4 months.

[u'On the status of the Michaelis-Menten equation and its implications for enzymology', ['Sosale Chandrasekhar'], u'2008-02-27', u'The Michaelis-Menten equation (MME) is considered to be the fundamental equation describing the rates of enzyme-catalysed reactions, and thus the \u2018physicochemical key\u2019 to understanding all life processes. It is the basis of the current view of enzymes as generally proteinaceous macromolecules that bind the substrate reversibly at the active site, and convert it to the product in a relatively slow overall sequence of bonding changes (\u2018turnover\u2019). The manifested \u2018saturation kinetics\u2019, by which the rate of the enzymic reaction (essentially) increases linearly with the substrate concentration ([S]) at low [S] but reaches a plateau at high [S], is apparently modelled by the MME. However, it is argued herein that the apparent success of the MME is misleading, and that it is fundamentally flawed by its equilibrium-based derivation (as can be shown mathematically). Thus, the MME cannot be classed as a formal kinetic equation vis-a-vis the law of mass action, as it does not involve the \u2018incipient concentrations\u2019 of enzyme and substrate; indeed, it is inapplicable to the reversible interconversion of substrate and product, not leading to the expected thermodynamic equilibrium constant. Furthermore, the principles of chemical reactivity do not necessarily lead from the above two-step model of enzyme catalysis to the observed \u2018saturation kinetics\u2019: other assumptions are needed, plausibly the inhibition of product release by the substrate itself. (Ironically, thus, the dramatic graphical representation of the MME encrypts its own fundamental flaw!) Perhaps the simplest indictment of the MME, however, lies in its formulation that the rate of the enzymic reaction tends towards a maximum of kcat[Eo] in the \u2018saturation regime\u2019. This implies \u2013 implausibly \u2013 that the turnover rate constant kcat can be known from the overall rate, but independently of the dissociation constant (KM) of the binding step.

These particles are non-toxic and have size comparable to biomolecules, becoming very suitable for biomedical applications. The particle structures can be engineered to perform multicolor imaging, as well as multiplex tasking such as site-selective binding, detection, and separation. In addition, these particles can load a large amount of fluorescent dye for signal amplification. Several synthetic techniques have been developed for a variety of submicron particles, including core-shell synthesis, layer-by-layer techniques, multi-block polymer emulsifications, and surface modifications. Silica particles are one of the most extensively studied particles as they can be easily modified with organic functionalities. However, these silica particles usually have only a single type of functional group. Therefore, multiple sequential modification steps have to be employed in order to attach multitasking components such as imaging components, drugs and targeting moieties. For wider biological applications, the development of a simple and efficient preparation method for particles with various types of functionalities is of great importance. Herein, a \u201cONE-POT\u201d; synthesis of multifunctional hybrid silica (MHS) particles of uniform size and morphology with homogeneously distributed multiple functional moieties is reported.

Here it is shown that the HR programmed cell death program initiated by the bacterial type III secretion system dependent proteinaceous elicitor harpin from Erwinia amylovora can be reversed till very late in the process by the plant growth regulator auxin. Early inhibition or late reversal of this cell death program does not affect marker genes tightly correlated with local and systemic resistance. Cross-regulation between cell death programs and growth regulators is prevalent in different kingdoms.

[u'Photoelectrochemical properties of melanin', ['Arturo Solis', 'Maria E. Lara', 'Luis E. Rendon'], u'2007-11-12', u'Melanin is to the animal kingdom like chlorophyll to the vegetal kingdom(1). Melanin collects energy from lower-energy radiation sources, kicks electrons into excited states, initiating a process that would end up producing chemical energy, similar to the way in which photosynthesis supplies energy to plants. However, the precise roles of melanin during this process are unknown. Here we show that the increase in the electron-transfer properties of melanin is independent of the energy of the incident photons. We found in controlled in vivo assays that melanin has the remarkable capability of converting lower-energy radiation towards a more useful form of energy. Furthermore, we found that melanin can break up water molecules and giving up energy suggesting an additional behavior mode for melanin. Our results demonstrate how members of the melanin family are likely to function as transducers, oxidizing water, pushing apart water molecules, as well as recruiting back ions into molecules that are subsequently polarized again. Melanin drives the photon energy of lower-energy radiation sources by quenching electrons and initiating an ionic event independently of their relative energy contention. We anticipate our assay to be a starting point for more sophisticated photoelectrochemical applications. For example, the individual and combined action of multiple photovoltaic applications could be tested, including conducting polymers, for example poly-(phenylenevinylene) (PPV) derivatives or C60 particles. Furthermore, melanin\u2019s energy conversion ability is a major target of solar energy conversion development, and an organic-semiconductor way for photoelectrochemical applications will be relevant for such developments.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/1312/version/1', [u'Biotechnology', u'Chemistry'], [u'FM SACV', u'University of the State of Morelos Mexico ', u'Mexican Institute of Water Technology']]

The appearance of pores in the lipid bilayer following some controlled mechanisms may be an adequate and interesting way. Some pores, named stochastic pores, can appear due to structural and dynamic properties of lipid bilayer, but others may be favored by mechanical tension induced by different ways. Recently, a sequence of 30-40 pores was observed in the same vesicle, a pore at a time, which can appear in vesicles stretched by optical induced mechanical tension. There are two very interesting biotechnological applications that require the increase of membrane permeability: gene therapy and targeted drug delivery. In the first one, the transport of DNA fragments through cellular and nuclear membranes is required. The second application uses drug molecules encapsulated in vesicles, which have to be transported to a target place. Having reached that point, one supposes that the liposome discharges its content by its breakdown.  In this paper, we will write about how a lipid vesicle has to release the drug molecules in a well-controlled fashion. Such liposomes are named  pulsatory liposomes and they induce cyclic activity. We will demonstrate that this liposome may be programmed to work a certain number of cycles, settled in advance. Also, we will calculate the amount of drug delivered during each cycle.

To directly quantify feedback strength and its effects on the duration of Tat transcriptional pulses, we exploit the noise inherent to gene-expression and measure shifts in the autocorrelation of expression noise. The results indicate that transcriptional positive-feedback extends the single-cell Tat expression lifetime by ~6-fold for both minimal Tat circuits and full-length, actively-replicating HIV-1. Importantly, artificial weakening of Tat positive-feedback shortened the duration of Tat expression transients and biased the probability in favor of latency.

[u'Hierarchical coexistence of universality and diversity controls robustness and multi-functionality in intermediate filament protein networks ', ['Theodor Ackbarow', 'Markus  J. Buehler'], u'2007-08-25', u'Proteins constitute the elementary building blocks of a vast variety of biological materials such as cellular protein networks, spider silk or bone, where they create extremely robust, multi-functional materials by self-organization of structures over many length- and time scales, from nano to macro.  Some of the structural features are commonly found in a many different tissues, that is, they are highly conserved.  Examples of such universal building blocks include alpha-helices, beta-sheets or tropocollagen molecules.  In contrast, other features are highly specific to tissue types, such as particular filament assemblies, beta-sheet nanocrystals in spider silk or tendon fascicles. These examples illustrate that the coexistence of universality and diversity \u2013 in the following referred to as the universality-diversity paradigm (UDP) \u2013 is an overarching feature in protein materials.  This paradigm is a paradox:  How can a structure be universal and diverse at the same time?  In protein materials, the coexistence of universality and diversity is enabled by utilizing hierarchies, which serve as an additional dimension beyond the 3D or 4D physical space.  This may be crucial to understand how their structure and properties are linked, and how these materials are capable of combining seemingly disparate properties such as strength and robustness.  Here we illustrate how the UDP enables to unify universal building blocks and highly diversified patterns through formation of hierarchical structures that lead to multi-functional, robust yet highly adapted structures.

In these studies, aided by improved algorithms for analyzing edge movement, we observed that each phase was dominated by a single, kinematically and biochemically distinct cytoskeletal organization, or motility type. Specifically, early spreading was dominated by periodic blebbing; continuous protrusion occurred predominantly during middle spreading; and periodic contractions were prevalent in late spreading. Further characterization revealed that each motility type exhibited a distinct distribution of the actin-related protein VASP, while inhibition of actin polymerization by cytochalasin D treatment revealed different dependences on barbed-end polymerization.

Disordered sustained vowels exhibit wide-ranging phenomena, from nearly periodic to highly complex, aperiodic vibrations, and increased \u201cbreathiness\u201d. Modelling and surrogate data studies have shown significant nonlinear and non-Gaussian random properties in these sounds. Nonetheless, existing tools are limited to analysing voices displaying near periodicity, and do not account for this inherent biophysical nonlinearity and non-Gaussian randomness, often using linear signal processing methods insensitive to these properties. They do not directly measure the two main biophysical symptoms of disorder: complex nonlinear aperiodicity, and turbulent, aeroacoustic, non-Gaussian randomness. Often these tools cannot be applied to more severe disordered voices, limiting their clinical usefulness.Methods: This paper introduces two new tools to speech analysis: recurrence and fractal scaling, which overcome the range limitations of existing tools by addressing directly these two symptoms of disorder, together reproducing a \u201choarseness\u201d diagram. A simple bootstrapped classifier then uses these two features to distinguish normal from disordered voices.Results: On a large database of subjects with a wide variety of voice disorders, these new techniques can distinguish normal from disordered cases, using quadratic discriminant analysis, to overall correct classification performance of 91.8% plus or minus 2.0%. The true positive classification performance is 95.4% plus or minus 3.2%, and the true negative performance is 91.5% plus or minus 2.3% (95% confidence). This is shown to outperform all combinations of the most popular classical tools.Conclusions: Given the very large number of arbitrary parameters and computational complexity of existing techniques, these new techniques are far simpler and yet achieve clinically useful classification performance using only a basic classification technique. They do so by exploiting the inherent nonlinearity and turbulent randomness in disordered voice signals. They are widely applicable to the whole range of disordered voice phenomena by design.

We also found that Dkk-1 was maximally expressed by the OS cells at the tumor periphery and in vitro Dkk-1 and RANKL are co-expressed by rapidly proliferating OS cells.

Using an HPLC assay, plasma CDA activity was confirmed to be decreased in individuals with the CDA SNP A79C. More interestingly, there was an even larger decrease in females. Explaining the decrease in enzyme activity, liver CDA expression was significantly lower in female versus male mice. As expected, decitabine plasma levels, measured by mass-spectrometry, were significantly higher in females. In mathematical modeling, the detrimental effect of shortening half-life of S-phase specific therapy was amplified in low S-phase fraction disease (e.g., MDS).

[u'New insight into DNA damage by cisplatin at the atomic scale', ['Raji Heyrovska'], u'2012-02-16', u'Cisplatin is cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II) of chemical formula, Pt(NH3)Cl2, abbreviated as cis-DDP and known commercially as platinol. It is used widely as an anticancer drug for various types of cancer, ever since its discovery two centuries ago and has become a target of extensive researches. Transplatin, trans-DDP on the other hand, is found to be less or ineffective to treat cancers. Cisplatin is known to interact mainly with the N(7) nitrogen of guanine in nucleic acids, after a water molecule takes away one of the chlorines by hydrolysis. This initiates the damage of nucleic acids and eventually leads to apoptosis. However the way how this happens and why transplatin is less effective is not completely clear. Here the author brings some new insights, using the precise structures of these molecules at the atomic level, how cisplatin can interact with the nitrogen of guanine and adenine and rupture the hydrogen bonding in the Watson Crick base pairs and damage the structure of DNA. It is hoped that the results presented here will contribute to a better atomistic insight into the structure, bonding and feasibility of the biochemical reactions involving these compounds and their derivates for the alleviation of cancer.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/6891/version/1', [u'Cancer', u'Chemistry', u'Molecular Cell Biology', u'Pharmacology'], [u'Institute of Biophysics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic']]
[u'Incidence response to a suddenly increased cancer risk', ['Orjan Hallberg'], u'2012-01-12', u'Incidence rates of several cancers, including melanoma of the skin and breast cancer, have increased since the middle of the 20th century in Western countries. Here, we developed a model for cancer incidence over time, when considering a suddenly increased cancer risk from an environmental change. A two parameter exponential function was used to simulate cancer risk over calendar time since birth, taking into account the time lapse since the environmental change took place. The calculated incidence for all age cohorts over calendar time was used to calculate the age-standardized rates. The best fit between calculated and reported age-standardized rates was sought by parameter variation. The model was tested using reported rates for melanoma and breast cancer. The best fit was obtained when an increased cancer risk took place from 1955 and with the starting age being that of puberty. Age-standardized rates of melanoma and breast cancer were easily modeled and fit well with reported data. In addition, age-specific rates fit well with reported data without further parameter adjustments. The good fit with reported data when using this simple exponential model strongly supports the hypothesis that an environmental change in the mid-20th century was the main cause of the cancer epidemic noted after 1955.

Opportunistic carcinogens can exploit these deficits by causing chronic inflammation, constant cell death and replacement in a mutagenic environment, DNA crosslinking or double strand breaks.  Some of the resulting cancers may be prevented if opportunistic carcinogens are identified.MethodsThe literature was systematically searched for carcinogens capable of exploiting deficits in BRCA1/2 pathways.   Search criteria were common exposure, available information, required BRCA1/2 pathway repairs, increased risks for any cancer, and effects on stem cells.ResultsFormaldehyde and acetaldehyde are closely related carcinogens and common pollutants that seem everywhere.  Alcohol metabolism also produces acetaldehyde.  High levels of either carcinogen overwhelm normal detoxification systems, cause inflammation, inhibit DNA repair and produce DNA cross links as critical carcinogenic lesions.  Searching model system studies revealed both carcinogens activate stem cells, BRCA1/2 pathways and connected BRCA1/2 pathways to myeloid leukemia.  For example, the BRCA1-BARD1 complex is required for proper nucleophosmin functions.  Nucleophosmin prevents a major subset of acute myeloid leukemia (AML).  Next, these concepts were independently tested against risks for myeloid leukemia.  Epidemiologic results showed that BRCA2 gene defects inherited on both chromosomes increased risks so dramatically that AML occurs in most children.  Using data from 14 studies, known/potential heterozygous BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations increased risks for myeloid leukemias by at least 3 fold in 7 studies and by at least 50% in 12.  Acetaldehyde occurs in breast milk.  In model studies, excessive acetaldehyde/alcohol exposure affects estrogen metabolism and stimulates alternate alcohol detoxification pathways.  These pathways can also cause DNA cross linking by releasing oxygen species and activating procarcinogens.  Acetaldehyde in rats\u2019 drinking water increased incidence of leukemias, lymphomas, pancreatic tumors and fibroadenomas.  Six human epidemiologic studies support an association between alcohol related genotype or alcohol consumption and early onset breast cancers, including those in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.

We investigated KD mutations in CD34+ stem cells from 100 CP-CML patients by multiplex ASO-PCR and sequencing ASO-PCR products at the time of diagnosis. PEMs were detected in 32/100 patients and included F311L, M351T, and T315I. After a median follow-up of 30 months (range 8-48), all patients with PEMs exhibited imatinib resistance.

Sharma'], u'2011-11-08', u'Oxidative stress and inflammation are two well-recognized events occurring in normal cells during cancer chemotherapy. Several antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agents have therefore been tried as rational and effective strategies for chemoprotection. Elaborate studies on antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents in various experimental models of cancer revealed that these agents act by modulating the expression and/or activity of the transcription factors nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB). Nrf2 is considered the main sentinel of antioxidant defense as it induces many antioxidant and phase 2 enzymes in response to stressful conditions. Likewise, NF-\u03baB is considered as a denominator of chronic and acute inflammatory processes. In recent years, it was found that a large pool of chemo-preventive and chemo-protective agents that restrain the NF-\u03baB inflammatory cascade also activates Nrf2 signaling. Diabetes and complications thereof are also conditions of amplified oxidative stress and inflammation in various target organs like retina, kidneys, nerves and vasculature. Here we propose that Nrf2 and NF-\u03baB are involved in the etiopathogenesis of diabetes and thus form attractive therapeutic targets.

The human TTF-1 and Pax-8 gene were transducted into the human thyroid carcinoma (K1 and F133) cells by the recombinant adenovirus, AdTTF-1 and AdPax-8. Reexpression of NIS mRNA and protein, but not TPO and Tg mRNA and protein, was detected in AdTTF-1-infected F133 cells, following with increasing radioiodine uptake (6.1~7.4 times), scarcely iodide organification and rapid iodide efflux (t1/2\u22488 min in vitro, t1/2\u22484.7 h in vivo).In contrast, all of the reexpression of NIS, TPO and Tg mRNA and proteins in F133 cells were induced by the synergetic effect of TTF-1 and Pax-8.

In vitro gene transfer activity of Fol-alpha-CDEs (G3, DSF 2, 5 or 7) was lower than that of \u03b1-CDE (G3) in KB cells, folate receptor (FR)-overexpressing cancer cells.

Negligible cytotoxicity of the pDNA complex with Fol-PalphaC (G3, DSF 5) was observed in KB cells or A549 cells up to a charge ratio of 100/1 (carrier/pDNA). The cellular association of the pDNA complex with Fol-PalphaC (G3, DSF 5) could be mediated by FR on KB cells, resulting in its efficient cellular uptake. Fol-PalphaC (G3, DSF 5) had higher binding affinity with folate binding protein (FBP) than alpha-CDE (G3), although the physicochemical properties of pDNA complex with Fol-PalphaC (G3, DSF 5) were almost comparable to that with alpha-CDE (G3), although the onset charge ratio and the compaction ability of Fol-PalphaC (G3, DSF 5) were slightly different.

Secretory clusterin (sCLU), an extra-cellular molecular chaperone, induced by low doses of cytotoxic agents, clears cell debris promoting survival. Low dose IR (>2 cGy) exposure induced hCLUp-Luc activity with peak levels at 96 h, consistent with endogenous sCLU levels. As doses increased (>1 Gy), sCLU induction amplitudes increased and time to peak response decreased. sCLU expression was stimulated by IGF-1, but suppressed by p53. Responses in transgenic hCLUp-Luc reporter mice after low IR doses showed that specific tissues (i.e., colon, spleen, mammary, thymus, bone marrow) of female mice induced hCLUp-Luc activity more than male mice after whole body >10 cGy. Tissue-specific, non-linear dose- and time-responses of hCLUp-Luc and endogenous sCLU levels were noted. Colon maintained homeostatic balance after 10 cGy. Bone marrow responded with delayed, but prolonged and elevated expression. Intraperitoneal administration of the \u03b1-TGF\xdf1 (1D11) antibody, but not a control antibody (13C4), immediately following IR exposure abrogated CLU induction responses. Induction in vivo also correlated with Smad signaling via activated TGF\xdf1 after IR.

Although berberine has recently been shown to suppress growth of several tumor cell lines, information regarding the effect of berberine on colon tumor growth is limited. Here, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the effects of berberine on regulating the fate of colon tumor cells, specifically the immorto Min mouse colonic epithelial (IMCE) cells carrying the Apcmin mutation, and of normal colon epithelial cells, namely young adult mouse colon (YAMC) epithelial cells. Berberine decreased colon tumor colony formation in agar, and induced cell death and LDH release in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in IMCE cells. In contrast, YAMC cells were not sensitive to berberine-induced cell death. Berberine did not stimulate caspase activation, and PARP cleavage and berberine-induced cell death were not affected by a caspase inhibitor in IMCE cells. Rather, berberine stimulated a caspase-independent cell death mediator, apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) release from mitochondria and nuclear translocation in a ROS production-dependent manner. Amelioration of berberine-stimulated ROS production or suppression of AIF expression blocked berberine-induced cell death and LDH release in IMCE cells. Furthermore, two targets of ROS production in cells, cathepsin B release from lysosomes and PARP activation were induced by berberine. Blockage of either of these pathways decreased berberine-induced AIF activation and cell death in IMCE cells. Thus, berberine-stimulated ROS production leads to cathepsin B release and PARP activation-dependent AIF activation, resulting in caspase-independent cell death in colon tumor cells.

The present work describes oncogenome`s model of cancer development, according to which, in order to stimulate cell division, viruses affect a gene (or several genes) during transduction of a signal for cell division from growth factor to cyclin/CDK system. At the same time, controlling gene (p53, RB etc.) function and a switch to apoptosis are suppressed.

[u'Inherited mutations impair responses to environmental carcinogens:  Cancer prevention in mutation carriers ', ['Bernard  Friedenson'], u'2011-07-28', u'Some environmental carcinogens may be responsible for an increase in the numbers of cancers but economic or political factors weigh against widespread bans.  However, lists of chemicals and agents that cause cancer assume that everyone is equally susceptible to their carcinogenic effects. In carriers of cancer gene mutations, carcinogens can target specific tissues especially during periods of stem cell activity if the hereditary deficit impairs normal protective responses.  Mutation carriers should then have higher risks for specific cancers caused by specific environmental carcinogens.  For example, it can be predicted that BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers should be highly susceptible to the carcinogen formaldehyde.   High formaldehyde levels can overwhelm normal enzyme detoxification systems or detoxification genes may be inadequate or missing.  Formaldehyde that is not detoxified can affect stem cells causing strands of DNA to cross-link to each other and to nearby proteins.  Carriers of mutations in BRCA1/2 dependent pathways are deficient in the ability to undo these cross-links.  Human myeloid leukemias are linked both to formaldehyde and to cancer stem cells.  Inherited biallelic BRCA2 gene defects and other defects in BRCA1/2 mediated pathways dramatically increase risks for myeloid leukemia, even among infants.  In 12 of 14 studies, heterozygous BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations increase risks for myeloid leukemias.  Moreover,  chromosome arms lost in hereditary breast cancers encode enzymes essential for formaldehyde metabolism.  BRCA1/2 mutation carriers may reduce their very high cancer risks by lowering their exposure to formaldehyde.  Cancers associated with many other hereditary gene deficits can also be stimulated by distinct environmental hazards.  Widespread education could prevent or delay some cancers in mutation carriers.

Genetic alterations such as mutations, i.e., substitutions, amplifications, and deletions of nucleotide sequences, are largely irreversible, whereas epigenetic alterations can be modified by pharmacological agents that target components of the epigenetic machinery. Recent studies have showed that introduction of defined factors such as those encoded by c-MYC, SOX2, OCT3/4, and KLF4 in normal somatic cells results in their dedifferentiation into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. In addition, we have reported that these iPS factors induce the development of induced multipotent cancer (iPC) cells from gastrointestinal cancer cells by reducing tumor aggressiveness. The efficiency of iPS reprogramming increased when p53 was inhibited. The study of cancer cells suggests that the p53 pathways might be involved in the aggressive phenotypes of iPC cells in a long-term culture. However, the roles of gain-of-function oncogenic mutations in TP53, which is a key tumor suppressor gene, remain to be elucidated. We investigated reprogramming efficiency of iPS generation in human diploid fibroblasts that were co-transfected with TP53 mutants and defined factors. The results suggest that mutations in those TP53 regions that are involved in DNA contact might play a critical role in the efficiency of iPS generation. Taken together, our studies suggest 2 roles of TP53 mutations in reprogramming: (1) the structural mutations might contribute to, or collaborate with, other mutations to regulate the maintenance of genomic stability; (2) the DNA-contact mutations could affect the downstream target genes, which may be distinct from those involved in wild-type p53 function.

It is now incontrovertible that formaldehyde increases risks for leukemias.  Evidence is also strong that formaldehyde causes some types of DNA damage in humans that are known to require repairs mediated by BRCA1/2 containing pathways.  Homologous recombination repairs require BRCA1/2, Fanconi and ATM proteins in these pathways.  Biallelic BRCA2 mutations interfere with these repairs and are clearly associated with leukemias, especially myeloid leukemias.  Fanconi anemia homozygotes have very high risks for acute myeloid leukemias.  Disabling BRCA1/2 related DNA repair processes prevents repair of formaldehyde related DNA damage in laboratory cells.  DNA-protein cross links result in the accumulation of DNA double strand breaks in homologous recombination-deficient but not homologous recombination -proficient cells.    ATM heterozygotes have increased risks for some leukemias that have been linked to formaldehyde in normal individuals.  Weaker evidence suggests increased risk for rare nasopharyngeal or sinonasal cancers in heterozygous BRCA1/2 mutation carriers and in ATM mutation carriers.  Formaldehyde is a pervasive environmental carcinogen that is theoretically more likely to cause malignancy in carriers of mutations that disable protective repair pathways.  Because of this potential for harm, it is prudent for mutation carriers to immediately avoid formaldehyde, especially high level exposure.

In order to coordinate collective multi- cellular migration, each constituent cell integrates local information including chemical signals and mechanical stresses. The boundary between a constituent cell and its immediate neighbors comprises cell-cell junctions and cryptic lamellipodia, but the state of local mechanical stress exerted at that boundary has not been accessible experimentally. As such it is not clear how collective mechanical processes could be coordinated over length scales spanning large multi-cellular assemblies. We report here maps of the stresses exerted within and between cells comprising a monolayer. Within the cell sheet there arise unanticipated fluctuations of mechanical stress that are severe, emerge spontaneously, and ripple across the monolayer. These fluctuations define a rugged stress landscape that becomes increasingly heterogeneous, sluggish, and cooperative with increasing system density. Within that persistently rugged stress landscape, local cellular migrations are found to migrate along local orientations of maximal principal stress. Migrations of both endothelial and epithelial monolayers conform to this behavior, as do breast cancer cell lines before but not after the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In these diverse cell types, our data indicate that collective migration is governed by a simple but unifying physiological principle: neighboring cells join forces to transmit appreciable intercellular normal stress across local cell-cell junctions, but migrate along orientations of minimal intercellular shear stress.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/5405/version/1', [u'Cancer', u'Developmental Biology', u'Molecular Cell Biology'], [u'Harvard School of Public Health', u'Mass General Hospital', u'University of Barcelona']]

There has been much conjecture to explain such apparently striking tissue specificity.  All these suggestions share the assumption that some disabled function of normal tumor suppressor genes leads to a tissue specific cancer response.  Here the idea is proposed and tested that major determinants of where BRCA1/2 hereditary cancers occur are related to tissue specificity of the cancer pathogen, the agent that causes chronic inflammation or the carcinogen.  The target tissue may have receptors for the pathogen, become selectively exposed to an inflammatory process or to a carcinogen such as during digestion, metabolism or elimination.  An innate genomic deficit in a tumor suppressor gene impairs normal responses to these extrinsic challenges and exacerbates the susceptibility to disease in organ targets.  This hypothesis also fits data for several tumor suppressors beyond BRCA1/2.

In contrast, pRB is undetectable in melanomas with wild-type B-Raf. Mutant B-Raf directly interacts with pRB and induces its phosphorylation at serine-249 and threonine-252 (S249/T252). Inhibition of B-Raf activity results in dephosphorylation of pRB at S249/T252 along with other sites in melanoma cells. S249/T252 are phosphorylated earlier than other sites during cell cycle entry of normal melanocytes. Blocking B-Raf activation precluded S249/T252 phosphorylation in mitogen-stimulated melanocytes, which was accompanied by the impaired phosphorylation of pRB at other sites. B-Raf enhanced CDK2-mediated pRB phosphorylation in an in vitro kinase assay.

This is supported by the presence of autoantibodies to muscarinic receptors , vimentin and LAMINB1 (all XMRV homologues) in chronic fatigue syndrome sufferers. Homologous XMRV proteins might also interfere with the protein interactomes of their human homologues. Viral mimicry of human proteins is extensive and often relevant to disease. For example Epstein-Barr viral proteins aligns with multiple sclerosis autoantigens, while HIV-1 proteins align with several components of the immune system. Mutant proteins in Huntington&apos;s disease and cystic fibrosis also align with proteins from common phages or viruses. This suggests a common theme of viral derived autoimmunity/network interference in many human disorders, which could radically change the shape of future therapy. Such viral mimicry likely relates to the idea that life evolved from viruses, leaving behind a legacy of viral derived human proteins whose homology to the current virome may be responsible for many human diseases and syndromes.

[u'ADP-ribose polymer \u2013 a novel and general biomarker of human cancers of head & neck, breast, and cervix', ['Rennie O. Lakadong', 'Amal C. Kataki', 'Rajeshwar N. Sharan'], u'2010-07-10', u'Background: Poly-ADP-ribosylation (PAR), a reversible post-translational modification of cellular proteins, is involved in various cellular and molecular processes including carcinogenesis (Althaus & Richter, 1987; Jacobson & Jacobson, 1989; Poirier & Moreau, 1992; Boulikas, 1993; Sharan, 2009). ADP-ribose polymer adducts are added onto target cellular proteins by this metabolic process. We hypothesize that a decrease in the concentration of total poly-ADP-ribose adducts of peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL) proteins strongly correlates with incidence of human cancer. Methods: A novel, sensitive and convenient immunoprobe assay of poly-ADP-ribose adducts of cellular proteins has been employed using slot blots of total PBL lysate (Sharan et al, 1998; 2005; Sharan, 2009).  This assay quantifies the metabolic concentration of poly-ADP-ribose adducts of cellular proteins.Results: Using the immunoprobe assay, we show a statistically significant (P \u2264 0.001) reduction (~ 42 to 49%) in the level of poly-ADP-ribose adducts of PBL proteins of patients with advanced cancers of head & neck (H & N) region (comprising fourteen distinct types of cancers at different sites), breast and cervix in comparison to healthy controls. Conclusion: These preliminary findings may imply potential utility of the poly-ADP-ribose adducts of PBL proteins as a novel and general biomarker of human cancers with potentials of clinical and epidemiological applications.

These peculiar staining characteristics suggested the involvement of calcium, and this was confirmed through staining with Alizarin red S. Using Alizarin staining as a marker for endothelial cell death permitted the use of public domain image analysis software which resulted in a sensitive and specific system for identifying active pharmaceuticals which target the tumor microvasculature at the same time direct antitumor cell effects are determined.

[u'Multidrug resistance of non-adherent cancer cells', ['Navneet  Singh', 'Subhas Chakrabarty', 'Guangming Liu'], u'2010-05-23', u'Metastases are the cause of 90% of human cancer deaths. Cancer in situ can usually be effectively removed by surgery. Once cancer cells disseminate from the original site and start to circulate in blood, lymph, or other body fluids, the disease becomes almost incurable. Here we show that cancer cells in a non-adherent, 3-dimentional growth pattern are highly drug resistant compared to their adherent counterparts that grow in monolayer, attaching to the wall of tissue culture plates. The non-adherent cancer cells retain the adhering potential and can attach to an appropriate surface to reacquire adherent phenotype. Once the non-adherent cancer cells become attached, they regain drug response, similar to the original adherent cells. A significant increase in the expression of CD133, CD44, Nanog, survivin, and thymidylate synthase was observed in the non-adherent cancer cells compared to their adherent counterparts, which may underlie the mechanisms of multidrug resistance of the cells. Since the non-adherent cancer cells cultured in vitro resemble the circulating metastatic cells in vivo in that both cells exhibit suspended non-adherent phenotype, possess re-attaching potential, and are highly drug resistant, we suggest that circulating metastatic cells can attach to an appropriate surface to gain adherent phenotype and subsequently acquire drug sensitivity. We propose that devices coated with cell attachment materials or small particles of extracellular matrix and collagen that mimic the structural framework of real human tissues to which cells can attach and grow may be able to stabilize the circulating metastatic cells. Once the metastatic cells undergo attachment and become adherent, they gain drug sensitivity and can be killed by anticancer drugs that are either administered to the blood or conjugated to the devices.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/4488/version/1', [u'Cancer', u'Molecular Cell Biology', u'Pharmacology'], [u'Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, SimmonsCooper Cancer Institute']]

The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are secreted developmental signaling molecules known to promote differentiation in the prostate. BMP ligands have been shown to inhibit prostate cancer cell line proliferation and tumor growth and expression of BMPs, BMP ligands, receptors and signaling effectors are diminished in prostate cancer. A previous report in the colon led us to investigate the potential mechanistic relationship between PTEN and BMP signaling in prostate epithelial cells. We show here that BPM signaling positively regulates PTEN in normal and malignant prostate cells by increasing mRNA expression and stabilizing PTEN protein. Further, we show that BMP attenuates prostate cell growth at least in part through its effects on PTEN. BMP treatment did not further inhibit the growth of conditional PTEN over-expressing cells, and stable shRNA-PTEN transfectants were refractory to BMP-mediated growth inhibition. Loss-of-function of PTEN in prostate cancer cells may render them insensitive to the normal differentiating and growth-inhibitory effects of BMPs.

Recent research has focused on better methods of treating such seemingly unavoidable hereditary cancers.  Prevention has received much less attention so a positive test result for a cancer gene leaves carriers with very limited options.  In order to prevent BRCA1/2 related cancers, it may be important to understand why they seem to occur only in certain characteristic organs.   Results here show that mutations in a pathway depending on BRCA1/2 gene products magnify cancer risks from chronic infection and inflammation, making them especially important in selecting the site where hereditary cancer develops.

[u'MicroDNAs and Transcriptional Regulation', ['Reza sheikhnejad'], u'2009-11-02', u'Synthetic "microDNAs (MIDs)"is a new class of ~ 20-25 nucleotide-long DNAs capable of repressing the activity of the target gene at the level of transcription by mechanisms that have not been clarified yet. However they are designed to target non-coding regions of the cancer causing genes, thus interfering with transcription. The inhibition might be possible through the direct binding of MIDs to cis-regulatory sites and/or to some Transcription Factors (TF) that normally activate transcription. Synthetic MIDs in some ways are similar to the newly discovered microRNAs a mechanism by which cell regulates its genetic activities at post-transcriptional level. Synthetic MIDs can provide a powerful tool to prevent massive production of mRNA by undesired gene activities. Therefore drugs are not required to interact with overwhelming number of mRNA and microRNA copies that may present unwanted side effects. In vitro studies suggest that the inhibition of the target gene starts after the first round of DNA replication, usually 24 hours after treatment depending on cell doubling time. Cell growth suppression maximizes at day 6 or 7 and the inhibition effect is sustained for weeks. We have shown that blocking of both bcl-2 and k-ras transcription by their specific microDNA Inhibitors induced apoptosis in HL60 leukemia cells and B-cell lymphomas.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/3931/version/1', [u'Cancer', u'Genetics & Genomics', u'Molecular Cell Biology'], [u'TODACO Research and Development, molecular biology']]

Fibroblasts derived from embryos of Jdp2KO mice proliferated more rapidly and formed more colonies than wild-type fibroblasts. JDP2 was recruited to the promoter of the gene for cyclin A2 (ccna2) at a previously unidentified AP-1 site. Cells lacking Jdp2 had elevated levels of cyclin A2 mRNA.

One of the major causes of the failure is due to the use of the wrong mouse models based on transplantable tumours in testing the efficacy of vaccines. Now that a transgenic epithelial mouse model has been developed to closely mimic cervical cancer, the mechanisms needed to eliminate this type of cancer could be studied. The E7 oncoprotein of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is the most expressed HPV protein in cervical cancers and its continuous production is essential to maintain the cancerous state and therefore the obvious target in the development of vaccines. Skin grafts expressing the HPV 16 E7 protein (E7 autografts) are not spontaneously rejected from an MHC matched immunocompetent host.  Interestingly, simultaneous placement of an MHC mismatched skin (allograft) next to an E7 autograft results in the E7 autograft rejection.  However when the allograft also expresses E7, the E7 autograft is rejected more slowly.  Autograft rejection requires CD8+ T cells, and is accelerated by removal of CD4+ T cells after placement of the E7 expressing allograft, suggesting induction of an E7 specific CD4+ regulatory T cell population by the E7 expressing allograft.

In vivo uptake of Tc-99m sestamibi and Tc-99m pertechnetate was two-fold and 10-fold higher for Ad-shMDR and Ad-hNIS-infected tumors as compared to tumors infected with a control adenovirus construct that expressed \u03b2-galactrosidase (Ad-LacZ), respectively. In mice treated with either doxorubicin or I-131 alone, there was a slight delay in tumor growth as compared to mice treated with Ad-LacZ. However, combination therapy with doxorubicin and I-131 induced further significant inhibition of tumor growth as compared with mice treated with Ad-LacZ.

Molecular cloning of the SCCA genomic region has revealed the presence of two tandemly arrayed genes, SCCA1 and SCCA2. We examined the promoter activity of the 5&apos;-flanking proximal region of the SCCA1 gene. Deletion analysis of SCCA1 promoter identified a 175-bp core promoter region and an enhancer region at -525 to -475 bp upstream of the transcription start site. The transcriptional activity of the SCCA1 promoter was up-regulated in squamous cell carcinoma cells, compared with normal keratinocyte, normal non-keratinocyte and adenocarcinoma cells. Five tandem repeats of enhancer increased SCCA1 promoter activity by 4-fold. Oncolytic adenovirus driven by the SCCA1 promoter with 5 tandem repeats of enhancer specifically killed squamous cell carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo.

Its immuno-activity, however, can be modulated by interleukin-12. So a strategy was designed using AAV2 carrying IL-12 to activate microglia then to eliminate cancerous cells. The transduction efficacy of AAV was evaluated with AAV2 encoding GFP and IL-12 on cancerous and CNS cells. The bioactivity of microglia modulated by IL-12 was examined and death receptors 4 and 5 were detected on cancerous cells. The effects of IL-12 and AAV2/IL-12 on microglial cytoxoxicity were evaluated too. The results demonstrated human cell line DBTRG, surgical specimen of GBM, and rat astrocyte expressed GFP quite well. Tremendous IL-12 secretion was detected in DBTRG, RG2, and astrocyte after transfection of AAV2/IL-12. TRAIL releasing and phagocytotic activity of microglia were significant, increasing (p<0.05) when the IL-12 protein or RG2-secreting IL-12 could have contact with microglial cells.

However, recent molecular studies of tumors indicate that multiple routes exist to the formation of cancer, not a single route. This parallel route hypothesis has not been tested with age-specific incidence data.To test the parallel route hypothesis, I formulated it in terms of a mathematical equation, confirmed this equation with computer simulations, then tested whether this equation was consistent with age-specific incidence data compiled by the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) cancer registries since 1973. I used the chi-squared goodness of fit test to measure consistency.I found that the age-specific incidence data from most human carcinomas, including those of the colon, lung, prostate, and breast were consistent with the parallel route hypothesis. However, this hypothesis is only consistent if an immune sub-population exists, one that will never develop carcinoma.

[u'Talin1 Promotes Prostate Cancer Invasion and Metastasis via AKT Signaling and Anoikis Resistance', ['Shinichi Sakamoto', 'Richard McCann', 'Natasha Kyprianou'], u'2009-04-10', u'Talin1 is an integrin regulatory protein that mediates integrin interactions with the extracellular matrix (ECM). This study investigated the significance of talin1 in prostate cancer progression to metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Talin1 overexpression enhanced prostate cancer cell adhesion, migration and invasion by activating survival signals and anoikis resistance. ShRNA-mediated talin1 loss led to a significant suppression of prostate cancer cell migration and transendothelial invasion in vitro and a significant inhibition of prostate cancer metastasis in vivo. Talin1 regulates cell survival signals via phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and AKT. Targeting AKT activation led to a significant reduction of talin1-mediated prostate cancer cell invasion. Furthermore, talin1 expression was determined by immunostaining in prostate tissue from the TRAMP mouse model and in human prostate cancer specimens. Talin1 levels directly correlated with prostate tumor progression to metastasis in TRAMP mice. Talin1 profiling in human prostate specimens revealed a significantly higher expression of cytoplasmic talin1 in metastatic tissue compared to primary prostate tumors and benign prostate tissue (P<0.0001). This evidence suggests a potential value for talin1 as a marker of prostate cancer metastasis and implies that disrupting talin1 mediated signaling may have therapeutic significance in the treatment of metastatic disease.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/3059/version/1', [u'Cancer'], [u'University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Urology', u'Mercer University School of Medicine, Biochemistry']]

Using models of hematopoiesis, we show that persistent self-renewal that ignores differentiation signals can be produced through two distinct pathways.  One pathway prevents repression of stem cell genes, producing daughter cells that resemble parental stem cells despite differentiation inducing lineage-specifying factor or cytokines.  Runx1 deficiency, a frequent abnormality in AML, demonstrates the second pathway, which allows cytokine/lineage-specifying factor mediated repression of stem cell genes but impairs subsequent activation of differentiation genes that terminate transit-amplification, producing self-renewal in daughter cells that do not resemble the parental stem cell.  Use of this pathway by AML cells has therapeutic relevance: cell-fate regulation by the chromatin-modifying protein DNMT1 is differentiation-phase dependent.  In the post lineage-commitment differentiation-phase at which AML cell self-renewal occurs, DNMT1 has an opposite role than in normal stem cells.  Consequently, DNMT1 depletion, using a clinically applicable method, terminates AML cell self-renewal but increases normal stem cell self-renewal.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/3044/version/1', [u'Cancer'], [u'Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, USA', u'Cincinnati Childrens Hospital, Cincinnati, USA ']]

Frizzled receptorslaunch several signaling cascades: the canonical pathway regulating beta-catenin-dependent transcription; the planar cell polarity pathway polarizing thecytoskeleton within the epithelial plane; and the calcium pathway. Frizzledreceptors possess seven transmembrane domains and their signaling depends ontrimeric G proteins in various organisms. However, Frizzleds constitute adistinct group within the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) superfamily, andFrizzled signaling can be G protein-independent in some experimental setups, which led to concerns about the GPCR nature of Frizzled. Here we demonstratethat human Frizzled receptors can directly bind the trimeric Go protein in apertussis toxin-sensitive manner. Furthermore, addition of Wnt ligands elicitsFrizzled-dependent guanine nucleotide exchange on Go.

It inhibits tubulin polymerization and induces mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis in various human cancer cells with different multi-drug resistance (MDR) status. Over-expression of an anti-apoptotic molecule, survivin, causes drug-resistance in various cancers. Survivin inhibits apoptosis by interfering caspase-3 and promotes cell growth by stabilizing microtubule networks. Here, we determined the effects of down-regulation of survivin in BPR0L075 (L075) treatment. Methods: Western blot analysis was used to determine the expression level of survivin in L075-untreated/-treated human oral carcinoma KB and nasopharyngeal carcinoma HONE-1 cancer cells. siRNA was used to down-regulate endogenous survivin. MTT cell viability assay, real-time caspase-3 activity assay and immuno-fluorescence microscopy were used to analyze downstream effects. Results: Survivin expression was up-regulated in both KB and HONE-1 cells in response to L075 treatment. Down-regulation of survivin induced hyper-sensitivity to L075 in KB and re-stored sensitivity to L075 in KB-derived L075-resistant KB-L30 cancer cells. At the molecular level, down-regulation of survivin induced changes in microtubule dynamics in both KB and KB-L30 cells. Surprisingly, down-regulation of survivin did not enhance the activity of caspase-3 in L075 therapy. Instead, down-regulation of survivin induced translocation of the apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) from cytoplasm to nucleus. Conclusion: Down-regulation of survivin improved drug sensitivity to L075 in both KB and L075-resistant KB-L30 cancer cells, possibly through a tubulin-dependent and caspase-independent mechanism.

A question arises as to whether the \u2018innate protection powers against human virus\u2019 are the same between males and females. We utilize HTLV-I infection blood donor data in 1995-1998 and case data of main infectious diseases such as influenza, mumps, herpangina, hand-hoot-and-mouse disease, chicken pox, etc. Blood donor data in 1995-1998, which were provided by Japan Red Cross Society of Oita, Japan, are summarized into the frequency table with respect to gender and age. The age groups are < 20, 20 < age , 30 < age , 40 < age , and > 50 years old. The comparison of carrier proportions of males and females under 20 years old is made with a two-sided statistical test and for the other groups one-sided tests are carried out. In case data published from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Japan, comparisons of the incidence rates of males and females in infectious diseases are carried out with two-sided tests. The present paper shows that the HTLV-I carrier proportion of girls is less than that that of boys. It implies that in HTLV-I the mother-to-child transmission probability of females is less than that of males. With respect to the other main infectious diseases, the majority of cases are under twenty years old, and the incidence rates of females are also significantly less than those of males.

[u'Off-target response to decoy oligodeoxynucleotide treatment', ['Ewan J. D. Robson', 'Aaron R. Jeffs', 'Michael R.

Inappropriate PAX2 expression has been implicated in facilitating tumour survival, and we have previously shown that siRNA-mediated blockade of PAX2 signalling at the transcript level in EJ bladder carcinoma cells promotes cell death. In this study, we attempted to disrupt PAX2 transcriptional activity in EJ cells by using a decoy oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN). Results: We could not show an interaction between PAX2 and our PAX2 decoy ODN, and in both PAX2-positive EJ and PAX2-negative HEK293 control cells, decoy and control ODN transfection resulted in a marked retardation of cell growth, irrespective of sequence, but not in COS7 and NZM4 melanoma cells. Conclusions: Our data indicate that decoy ODN transfection had off-target effects that inhibited cell growth in a cell line-dependent manner, and we suggest caution is required to determine the specificity of decoy ODN sequences before considering their application as a potential therapeutic agent.

It also binds p53 and inhibits its action. One set of experimental findings based on over-expression of PPP1R13L indicates that PPP1R13L blocks apoptosis. Another set of experiments, based on endogenous production of PPP1R13L, suggests that the protein may sometimes be pro-apoptotic. We have used primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), dually transformed by H-ras and Adenovirus E1A and differing in their p53 status, to explore the effects of PPP1R13L over-expression, thus examining the ability of PPP1R13L to act as an oncoprotein. We found that over-expression of PPP1R13L strongly accelerated tumor formation by ras/E1A and also resulted in an increased metastatic potential of the tumors. PPP1R13L over-expressing cells were depleted for both p53 and active p65/RelA and we found that both p53 dependent and independent apoptosis pathways were regulated by PPP1R13L. Finally, studies with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 revealed that over-expression of PPP1R13L causes faster p53 degradation, a likely explanation for the depletion of p53.

PCI-24781 induced dose-dependent apoptosis that was associated with prominent G0/G1 arrest, decreased S-phase, increased p21 protein expression, and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, PCI-24781-induced apoptosis was shown to be ROS- and caspase-dependent. Combined PCI-24781 and bortezomib exposure resulted in strong synergistic apoptosis in all cell lines (combination indices 0.19-0.6). Furthermore, compared to either agent alone, PCI-24781/bortezomib resulted in increased caspase cleavage, mitochondrial depolarization, and histone hyperacetylation. Microarray analyses showed that PCI-24781 alone significantly downregulated several antioxidant genes, proteasome components, and NF-kappaB pathway genes, effects which were enhanced further with bortezomib. RT-PCR confirmed downregulation of NF-kappaB targets NF-kappaB1 (p105), c-Myc, and IkappaB-kinase subunits, while gel-shift showed decreased NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity.

Genes with statistically significant sequence similarity to vertebrate ERs have been found in lamprey, a basal vertebrate, and amphioxus, a basal chordate.  Motif analysis of these sequences provides an opportunity to investigate early events in the evolution of the ER.Results.  We used artificial intelligence-based software to construct twelve motifs specific to the estrogen-binding domain of ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 in land vertebrates and teleosts.  We mapped these ER-specific motifs onto the sequences of lamprey, amphioxus, invertebrate and selected vertebrate ERs and amphioxus, Ciona and human estrogen-related receptor (ERR).  We find that lamprey ER contains eleven motifs common to ERs in the training set.  In contrast, amphioxus ER contains only six motifs.  Various invertebrate ERs contain either six or seven motifs.  Unexpectedly, human and amphioxus ERRs contain nine of the twelve motifs, despite extensive sequence divergence during the descent of chordate ERs and ERRs from a common ancestor.  We mapped the twelve motifs onto a multiple alignment of human, lamprey and amphioxus ERs, which depicted residues in human ER\u03b1 that are known to bind estradiol.  There is excellent conservation of these key residues in lamprey ER and poor conservation in amphioxus ER.  Out of seventeen residues on human ER\u03b1 that bind estradiol, sixteen and six are identical in lamprey and amphioxus ER, respectively.  A phylogenetic tree of ERs and ERRs reveals a long branch for amphioxus ER, which is in agreement with the low sequence and motif similarity between amphioxus ER and other ERs.Conclusions.  There are significant differences between B. floridae ER and vertebrate ERs in the steroid-binding domain as measured by motif analysis and percent of amino acids that are known to stabilize estradiol in human ER\u03b1. The absence in lamprey ER of motif 10, which maps to the C-terminus half of \u03b1-helix 9, may be important in recognition of novel estrogens, such as 15\u03b1-hydroxy-estradiol.

This finding raised an important question: Does this mechanism stimulate or inhibit angiogenesis? Here we report that VEGF-mediated apoptosis is required for TGF-\u03b21 induction of angiogenesis. In vitro the apoptotic effect of TGF-\u03b21 on endothelial cells is rapid and followed by a long period in which the cells are refractory to apoptosis induction by TGF-\u03b21. Inhibition of VEGF / flk-1 signaling abrogates formation of vessel-like structures by TGF-\u03b21 with an effect comparable to that of z-VAD, an apoptosis inhibitor. Similarly, genetic deficiency of VEGF abolishes TGF-\u03b21 upregulation of endothelial cell differentiation and formation of vascular structures in embryoid bodies. In vivo TGF-\u03b21 induces endothelial cell apoptosis as rapidly as in vitro. Inhibition of VEGF blocks TGF-\u03b21 induction of both apoptosis and angiogenesis, an effect similar to that of z-VAD. Thus, TGF-\u03b21 induction of angiogenesis requires rapid and transient endothelial cell apoptosis mediated by VEGF/flk-1.

While absence of RIZ1 was tumorigenic in mice fed the balanced diet, its presence did not prevent tumor formation in mice fed the imbalanced diet.  Unlike most of its related enzymes, RIZ1 was upregulated by methyl-balanced diet.  Methyl-balanced diet did not fully repress oncogenes such as c-Jun in the absence of RIZ1.

Here, we demonstrate that activation of the tumor-associated and over-expressed EGFR desensitizes TGF-\u03b2 signaling and its cytostatic regulation through specific Stat3 activation and Smad7 induction. In normal and tumor human cell lines, reduction of TGF-\u03b2-mediated Smad2 phosphorylation, nuclear translocation and Smad3 target gene activation were observed where EGFR is over-expressed, but not in cells which expressed EGFR at normal levels. The EGFR downstream signaling molecules phosphatidyinositol-3 Kinase (PI3K) or mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase (MEK) are not responsible for the down-regulation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling since blockade of them by specific pharmacological inhibitors LY294002 and U0126 had little effects on the sensitivity of TGF-\u03b2 signaling. We identified Stat3 as a signaling molecule activated specifically and persistently by over-expressed EGFR, but not by normal levels. Importantly, Stat3 is responsible for the reduced TGF-\u03b2 sensitivity, since its knockdown by siRNA restored TGF-\u03b2 signaling sensitivity. Furthermore, over-expressed EGFR, through Stat3 activates Smad7 promoter activity, increasing its protein levels, which is a negative regulator of TGF-\u03b2 signaling. Consequently, cells were re-sensitized to TGF-\u03b2 when Smad7 expression was reduced using siRNA. Therefore we establish a novel EGFR-Stat3-Smad7-TGF-\u03b2 signaling molecular axis where tumor-associated over-expression of EGFR in epithelial cells results in hyperactivation of Stat3, which activates Smad7 expression, compromising the TGF-\u03b2\u2019s cytostatic regulation of epithelium and consequent tumor formation.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/1535/version/1', [u'Cancer', u'Molecular Cell Biology'], [u'The University of Melbourne, Surgery (RMH)', u'The University of Melbourne']]

[u'Method of Detecting and Targeting Mutations in Cancer', ['Byard Edwards'], u'2007-11-13', u'While there are many differences between tumor and non-tumor cells, the basic underlying distinction is in the DNA.  Tumor cells harbor mutations, at least some of which are not present in non-tumor cells.  Thus, a method of directly targeting cells containing specific mutations has potential for detection or treatment of cancer without the toxicity associated with more indirect approaches.  Also, as mutations are a necessary component of malignancy, such a method is potentially applicable to all tumors.  I propose a method by which several recently developed techniques can be utilized in a novel way to accomplish the goal of directly targeting mutations for cancer detection and therapy.  The model can be summarized as follows:  (1) Determine potential target mutations present in tumor cells but not non-tumor cells.  (2)  Construct molecules that will bind to DNA at the sites of mutation, but will not bind to DNA in normal cells.   And, as a consequence of the molecules binding to the mutation, the cells will be destroyed.  (3)  Deliver these molecules to all cells (or at least all tumor cells).  I hypothesize that such molecules can now be constructed using sequence-specific DNA binding proteins (such as customized zinc-finger DNA binding proteins) fused to transcriptional activator domains (such as VP16) and reporter or toxin genes.

[u'Is the infection/latency/reactivation cycle of viruses an oncogenic engine?', ['Alessandro Ripalti'], u'2007-10-31', u'Human oncogenic viruses are defined as necessary but not sufficient to initiate cancer. Experimental evidence suggests that the oncogenic potential of a virus is effective only in cells that have already accumulated a number of genetic mutations leading to cell cycle deregulation. Current models for viral driven oncogenesis cannot explain why tumor development in carriers of tumorigenic viruses is a very rare event, occurring decades after virus infection. Considering that viruses are mutagenic agents per se and human oncogenic viruses additionally establish latent and persistent infections, I attempt here to provide a mechanism of tumor initiation both for RNA and DNA viruses, suggesting viruses could be both necessary and sufficient in human tumorigenesis. I hypothesize a general, albeit inefficient hit and rest mechanism by which viruses may produce a limited reservoir of cells harbouring genetic damage that would be initiated when the virus first hits the cell, before latency is established.

Montemurro', 'Bo Hu', 'Shi-Yuan Cheng'], u'2007-10-19', u'Occupancy of new habitats through dispersion is a central process in nature. In particular, long distance dispersal is involved in the spread of species and epidemics, although it has not been previously related with cancer invasion, a process that involves cell spreading to tissues far away from the primary tumor.Using simulations and real data we show that the early spread of cancer cells is similar to the species individuals spread and that both processes are represented by a common spatio-temporal signature of long-distance dispersal and subsequent local proliferation. This signature is characterized by a particular fractal geometry of the boundaries of patches generated, and a power law-scaled, disrupted patch size distribution. In contrast, invasions involving only dispersal but not subsequent proliferation (\u201cphysiological invasions\u201d) like trophoblast cells invasion during normal human placentation did not show the patch size power law pattern. Our results are robust to temporal and spatial scales, and to the resolution level of analysis.We conclude that the scaling properties are a hallmark and a direct result of long-distance dispersal and proliferation, and that they reflect homologous ecological processes of population self-organization during cancer and species spread. Our results are significant for the detection of processes involving long-range dispersal and proliferation like cancer metastasis, biological invasions and epidemics, and for the formulation of new cancer therapeutical approaches.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/907/version/2', [u'Cancer', u'Ecology'], [u'Universidad Nacional de Cordoba', u'University of Manchester', u'University of Pittsburgh']]

This cow was culled, and samples of her mammary gland tissue were examined for gross histology. In this study we demonstrate for the first time that modern dairy cow may undergo extensive obliteration of the lobular-alveolar structure, as expected in involution stage II. Conclusions/SignificanceWe conclude that lack of histological evidence for the appearance of involution stage II in the vast majority of modern cow\u2019s population is related to the peculiar modern dairy husbandry, in which dairy cows are induced into involution still pregnant. Because retardation of involution stage II in pregnant mammals is most likely a general physiological phenomena, it might occurs in other mammals, particularly in lactating humans.

If for example oncogenic RAF is expressed together with Myc in B lineage cells, a lineage switch to macrophages occurs at low frequency in vitro and in vivo. In addition, if RAF is expressed in type II alveolar epithelial cells slow growing lung adenomas are formed and a switch from columnar to cuboidal cells is detected in these mice upon p53 deletion. A similar switch is also seen, if ectopic Myc is present in our lung tumor mouse model. Moreover, in the liver of these mice with both oncogenes metastases are found. If E-cadherin function is impaired in our RAF-dependent lung tumor model, a switch from adenoma to adenocarcinoma occurs and genes characteristic for the early endodermal lineage are expressed. Based on these data I propose a novel model of metastasis and describe its implications. The hallmark of the model is the induction of a state of plasticity in tumor cells, which allows the reversal of differentiation to an earlier point in their ontogenic history.

However, the nature of this cooperation remains elusive. Here we show that PIM1 contributes to the transcriptional activation of MYC-target genes by phosphorylating the histone H3 nucleosome at Serine 10 (H3S10). Recombinant PIM1 directly phosphorylates H3S10 on the nucleosome in vitro. Following growth factor stimulation, PIM1 accumulates in the nucleus where it forms a complex with the MYC/MAX dimer via the MYC BoxII domain (MBII). Immunofluorescence analysis coupled with in vivo run-on shows a high degree of PIM1 and MYC co-localization in the nucleus at sites of active transcription. Expression profile analysis revealed that PIM1 contributes to the regulation of 20% of the MYC-regulated genes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis in MYC silenced cells demonstrates that MYC recruits PIM1 to the E boxes of the MYC-target genes FOSL1 (FRA1) and ID2. PIM1 knockdown as well as the over-expression of the kinase inactive mutant demonstrate that PIM1 is required for H3S10 phosphorylation at FOSL1 and ID2 MYC-binding sites and for their transcriptional activation. Moreover, we show that PIM1-dependent H3S10 phosphorylation contributes to MYC transforming capacity. These results establish a new function for PIM1 as a MYC cofactor that phosphorylates the chromatin at MYC-target loci and suggest that nucleosome phosphorylation, at E boxes, contributes to MYC-dependent transcriptional activation and cellular transformation.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/100/version/1', [u'Cancer', u'Molecular Cell Biology'], [u"Universita' di Siena, Dipartimento di Biologia Molecolare"]]

One reason is the lack of sufficient antioxidants in the seminal plasma and semen extender. The antioxidant content is reduced during the cryopreservation process and causes premature cryo-capacitation and modification of sperm membrane structure upon thawing. So the study of pre-freezing and post thaw seminal parameters like viability, motility, acrosomal integrity, lipid peroxide assay, vanguard distance traveled by sperm, mitochondrial membrane potential, velocity and motility parameters (CASA) and field fertility trial helped to assess the effectiveness of the additives. The conception rate was better in reduced glutathione than the cysteine hydrochloride treated group. The glutathione has improved the poor freezing and maintained the good freezable semen.

[u'Non-linear Effects in Asymmetric Catalysis: Whys and Wherefores', ['Sosale Chandrasekhar'], u'2012-02-27', u'It is argued that the titled non-linear effects (NLE) may arise whenever the order of the reaction in the chiral catalyst in greater than 1. In a fundamental departure from previous approaches, this is mathematically elaborated for the second order case. (NLE may also be observed if the chiral catalyst forms non-reacting dimers in a competing equilibrium; practically, however, this implies the in situ resolution of the catalyst.) The amplification of enantiomeric excess by NLE implies a relative (although modest) reduction in the entropy of mixing. The consequent increase in free energy apparently indicates a non-equilibrium process. It is suggested, based on arguments involving the chemical potential, that kinetically-controlled reactions lead to a state of \u201cquasi-equilibrium\u201d: in this, although overall equilibrium is attained, the product-spread is far from equilibrium. Thus, both the linear and NLE cases of chiral catalysis represent departures from equilibrium (which requires that the product e.e. = 0). Interesting similarities exist with models of non-equilibrium systems, the NLE cases apparently being analogs of open systems just after the bifurcation point has been crossed.

Natural zeolites emerge from that research as the best in class of this category. Zeolites are natural materials relatively abundant and non biodegradable, economic and good to perform processes of environmental remediation. This paper contains a full description of a new method to characterize superficial properties of natural zeolites of exotic provenience (Caribbean Islets) with atomic force microscopy (AFM). AFM works with the optical microscope simplicity and the high resolution typical of a transmission electron microscope (TEM). Structural information of mesoporous material is obtained using scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM), only if the sample is conductive, otherwise the sample has to be processed through the grafitation technique, but this procedure induces errors of topography. Therefore, the existing AFM method, to observe zeolite  powders, is made in a liquid cell-head scanner, but this work puts in evidence and confirms that it is possible to use an ambient air-head scanner to obtain a new kind of microtopography. Once optimized, this new method allows investigating of organic micelles, very soft nanostructure, of cetyltriammonium bromide (CTAB) upon an inorganic surface such as natural zeolites.

Acid- (kA) and base- (kB) catalyzed and neutral (kN) hydrolysis rate constants in pure water at 25\xb0C were estimated for these aroma compounds. Where available, good agreement between theoretical and experimental hydrolytic half-lives was obtained at various pH values. Wide ranges and broad frequency distributions for kA, kB, and kN are expected among the various hydrolyzable aroma compounds, with estimated kA ranging from 3.7\xd710-8 to 4.7\xd710-4 M-1 s-1, estimated kB ranging from 4.3\xd710-4 to 43 M-1 s-1, and estimated kN ranging from 4.2\xd710-17 to 7.6\xd710-9 M-1 s-1. The resulting hydrolytic half-lives also range widely, from 10 days to 370 years at pH 2.8, 18 days to 4,900 years at pH 4.0, 1.8 days to 470 years at pH 7.0, and 26 minutes to 5.1 years at pH 9.0.

The G4/W1BD ES-T are systematically higher than these prior estimates by between 1 to 5 kcal/mol, averaging positive deviations of about 1-2 and 3-4 kcal/mol from the CCSD(T) and B3LYP estimates, respectively. Qualitative ground state multiplicity agreement between the four levels of theory was found for H2C=Si, H2Si=Si, HN=Si, (H3C)HSi=Si, (H3C)2Si=Si, (H2N)HSi=Si, (H2N)2Si=Si, (HO)2Si=Si, and F2Si=Si. However, there is disagreement as to the ground state multiplicity for (HO)HSi=Si and FHSi=Si using the different theoretical methods. For (HO)HSi=Si, G4 and W1BD methods predict either a slightly energetically favored ground state singlet (G4) or an energetic degeneracy between the two multiplicities (W1BD). For FHSi=Si, both the G4 and W1BD methods predict a clear ground state singlet, whereas the CCSD(T)/6-311++G(d,p)//QCISD/6-31G(d) method predicts effective energetic degeneracy, and the B3LYP/AUG-cc-pVTZ//B3LYP/6-31+G(d) method predicts a clear ground state triplet. In light of the current high-level calculations, the ground state multiplicities of (HO)HSi=Si and FHSi=Si should be considered uncertain due to disagreement among various levels of theory.

[u'Soluble oligomerization provides a beneficial fitness effect on destabilizing mutations.', ['Shimon Bershtein', 'Eugene Shakhnovich'], u'2011-08-08', u'Protein stability is widely recognized as a major evolutionary constraint. However, the relation between mutation-induced perturbations of protein stability and biological fitness has remained elusive. Here we explore this relation by introducing a selected set of mostly destabilizing mutations into an essential chromosomal gene of E.coli encoding dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) to determine how changes in protein stability, activity and abundance affect fitness. Several mutant strains showed no growth while many exhibited fitness higher than wild type. Overexpression of chaperonins (GroEL/ES) buffered the effect of mutations by rescuing the lethal phenotypes and worsening better-fit strains. Changes in stability affect fitness by mediating the abundance of active and soluble proteins; DHFR of lethal strains aggregates, while destabilized DHFR of high fitness strains remains monomeric and soluble at 30oC and forms soluble oligomers at 42oC. These results suggest an evolutionary path where mutational destabilization is counterbalanced by specific oligomerization protecting proteins from aggregation.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/6219/version/1', [u'Chemistry', u'Genetics & Genomics', u'Molecular Cell Biology', u'Evolutionary Biology'], [u'Harvard University, Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology']]

[u'Inhibition of Acid Phosphatase Enzyme Activity in the Presence of Noncrystalline Calcium Phosphate and Nanocrystalline Calcium Apatite: a Preliminary Study ', ['Yassen Pekounov'], u'2010-11-09', u'BackgroundOur bones are remodelled repeatedly throughout life. New and \u201chealthy\u201d bone tissue replaces the old one. It has been shown that the bone degrading cells, the osteoclasts, prefer old and fatigued bone. The young bone mineral, i.e. calcium apatite, is less crystalline than the mature one. Is it possible that the osteoclasts distinguish between relatively old and new bone via its mineral crystallinity?Methodology/Principal FindingsAcid phosphatase is an enzyme abundantly expressed by the osteoclasts during resorption and therefore used as a marker of the cells\u2019 activity. This study explores whether its enzymatic activity would be decreased in the presence of biomimetically prepared noncrystalline calcium phosphate and nanocrystalline bone-like calcium apatite. The results showed that both biomimetic samples decreased significantly the enzyme activity while commercially available calcium phosphate samples (hydroxyapatite and brushite) did not. Consistent with our hypothesis the noncrystalline calcium phosphate had the greater inhibition effect.Conclusions/SignificanceThe in vitro data suggest that the bone-resorbing cells\u2019 activity could be regulated by the degree of crystallinity of the bone mineral. These findings imply that changes in the properties of biogenic inorganic materials induce specific interactions with biomolecules, which in turn should define the cell\u2019s behaviour.

Dimming the income sunlight by some \u201cgeoengineering\u201d approaches currently seem ruinously expensive and technically difficult, and would not prevent the increase of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in atmosphere and ocean acidification, so capturing carbon to reduce the environmental concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) and promoting renewable energy development for the reduction of using fossil fuels are very necessary. Biofuels derived from natural and agricultural biomass could be deployed for power production and existing transportation needs. The current economics are more favorable for conversion of edible biomass into biofuels, which could spend plenty of freshwater and farmlands, compete with food supply, and create a \u201ccarbon debt\u201d with local ecosystem destruction by deforestation to expand biofuel-crop production. So it is vital to develop processes for converting non-edible feedstock such as lignocellulose and microalgae into biofuels.  Compared with lignocellulose, microalgae have higher growth rates, don\u2019t need plenteous freshwater for irrigating, and can grow in the conditions that are not favorable for terrestrial biomass growth. The current limitation of microalgal biofuels is the microalgae cultivation cost, and to compensate the high cost of microalgal biofuels, three suggestions are propounded here. (i) Using ships as the platforms of cultivating microalgae, producing biofuels, and transporting feedstock and products on a large scale on subtropical oligotrophic oceans, where the ocean\u2019s least productive waters are formed with compared peaceful surface condition and poor marine communities. (ii) Operating different kinds of oceanic biomass productions for high-value products to compensate the cost of microalgal biofuels. Different kinds of microalgae and macroalgae (seaweeds) could be cultivated for biofuels, chemicals, healthy food, and feed for breeding economic marine species to satisfy the accelerating demands for seafood supply and simultaneously mitigate the fast decline of wild stocks. (iii) Constituting financial subsidies to make CO2 as the feedstock of microalgae cultivation for free, and exact quantifying the carbon captured in biomass products and the CO2 reduction that these products would provide by displacing natural and nonrenewable carbon resources, to take part in the international carbon-credit trading markets and sell the offsets.

For a subset of highly polar and generally polyfunctional neutral organic compounds previously identified as problematic for prior solvation models, we find significantly reduced \u0394Gosolv errors using the revised solvent models in G09. The use of composite methods for these compounds also substantially reduces their apparent \u0394Gosolv errors. In contrast, no general level of theory effects between the B3LYP/6-31+G** and G4 methods were observed on a suite of simpler neutral, anionic, and cationic molecules commonly used to benchmark solvation models. Further investigations on mono- and polyhalogenated short chain alkanes and alkenes and other possibly difficult functional groups also revealed significant \u0394Gosolv error reductions by increasing the level of theory from DFT to G4.

The SPARC software program and comparative density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to investigate the aqueous phase hydration equilibrium constants (Khyd) of PFAlds and FTAlds.

While SPARC correctly estimates the Khyd for the C1 PFAld, it appears to incorrectly predict a large decline in Khyd (particularly between C1 and C2) with increasing perfluoroalkyl chain length for this class of compounds. Both SPARC and DFT investigations suggest that FTAlds will not likely be substantially hydrated in aquatic systems or in vivo. Using corrected SPARC estimates, PFAld hydrates are expected to have pKa values in the range of phenols (ca. 9 to 10), whereas n:2 FTAld hydrates are expected to have pKa values ca. 2 to 3 units higher (ca. 12 to 13).

The question revisited recently [1\u20133] is whether it carries a predictive physical meaning in its own right beyond being an unquestionably convenient label. For example, whereas the color of compounds physically reflects the relative energetic positions of occupied vs. unoccupied, dipolecoupled energy levels, can the color be explained [4] by the oxidation state of the central ion? Can the different colors of various Mn compounds be predicted or explained in terms of their oxidation numbers [e.g. pink Mn(II) vs. black Mn(IV) vs. purple Mn(VII)], or does such understanding entail knowledge of the occupancy of the hybridized d bands, a knowledge not provided by the ON (but possibly labeled by it, once such understanding is independently acquired)? Also, the photoemission core shifts of an atom within a molecule (e.g. relative to a reference of the atom in its elemental form) physically represent the balance of all electrostatic charges in the system as felt by that atomic site. Can this balance be predicted or explained [1] by the oxidation number of the ion, or is the latter only a convenient short-hand notation (often assigned ex post facto) for an otherwise possibly nontrivial electronic structure? In other words, the central question here is whether the Oxidation Number is predictive, in its own right, or does it act functionally as a Social Security Number that conveniently labels a person, but by itself (e.g., without additional access to financial, medical, or educational records, or psychoanalysis) does not lead to understanding of the person.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/4012/version/1', [u'Chemistry'], [u'Department of Physics, Yokohama National University', u'National Renewable Energy Laboratory', u'Dipartimento di Fisica Teorica, Universit`a di Trieste']]

The semiempirical AM1, PM3, and PM6 methods all consistently and accurately predict that branched alkyl compounds will generally be more thermodynamically stable than their linear counterparts. In contrast, HF and B3LYP calculations with the 6-31G(d,p), 6-31++G(d,p), and 6-311++G(d,p) basis sets predict that linear isomers will be more stable than branched analogs. These different linear versus branched perfluoroalkyl/perhydroalkyl thermodynamic property trends between semiempirical and ab initio/DFT methods were evident in both gas and aqueous phase calculations. Comparison of experimentally determined thermodynamic properties for several classes of linear and branched alkanes and alcohols with values calculated at the PM6 and B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) levels of theory supported the well known findings that such DFT and HF approaches incorrectly predict branched alkyl compounds will be less thermodynamically stable than linear isomers.

Under some environmental conditions, hydrolysis of monomeric FTAcrs could be rapid (half-lives of several years in marine systems and as low as several days in some landfills) and represent a dominant portion of their overall degradation. Abiotic hydrolysis of monomeric FTAcrs may be a significant contributor to current environmental loadings of fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs) and perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs). Polymeric FTAcrs are expected to be hydrolyzed more slowly, with estimated half-lives in soil and natural waters ranging between several centuries to several millenia absent additional surface area limitations on reactivity. Poor agreement was found between the limited experimental data on FTPE hydrolysis and computational estimates, requiring more detailed experimental data before any further modeling can occur on these compounds or their perfluoroalkyl sulfonamidoethanol phosphate ester (PFSamPE) analogs. FTIs are expected to have hydrolytic half-lives of about 130 days in most natural waters, suggesting they may be contributing to substantial FTOH and PFCA inputs in aquatic systems. Perfluoroalkyl sulfonamides (PFSams) appear unlikely to undergo abiotic hydrolysis at the S-N, C-S, or N-C linkages under environmentally relevant conditions, although potentially facile S-N hydrolysis via intramolecular catalysis by ethanol and acetic acid amide substituents warrants further investigation.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/3728/version/1', [u'Chemistry', u'Earth & Environment'], [u'Ecologica Research', u'Okanagan College']]

The limited experimental Koc dataset for the straight chain C7 through C10 PFCAs and C8 and C10 PFSAs was correlated to SPARC and ALOGPS computationally estimated octanol-water partitioning / distribution constants and used to predict Koc values for both branched and linear C1 through C8 isomers. Branched and linear congeners in this homologue range are generally expected to have Koc values >1, leading to their accumulation in organic matter on sediments and soils, retardation during ground and pore water flow, and the preferential association with dissolved organic matter in aquatic systems. Both increasing perfluoroalkyl chain length and linearity increase Koc values with substantial intra- and inter-homologue variation and interhomologue mixing. Variability in Koc values among the PFCA and PFSA congeners will likely lead to an enrichment of more linear and longer chain isomers in organic matter fractions, resulting in aqueous phases fractionated towards shorter chain branched congeners. The expected magnitude of fractionation will require inclusion in source apportionment models and risk assessments.

We desulfurized two geochemical extracts: one sample is a Monterey shale of late Miocene age, and the other sample is a surface sediment from the Greenland lake Brayas\xf8. Both samples contained organic sulfur compounds, but the Monterey shale was biologically and thermally modified after deposition. A comparison of the free and sulfur-bound hydrocarbons from each sample revealed a precursor-product relationship between tocopherol and pristane, for Monterey. Greenland\u2019s composition may indicate that photochemical sulfurization occurs in the Brayas\xf8 oxic zone. We found that sulfurization may proceed at different rates for different compound families; for example, we did not see any sulfurized alkenones in Brayas\xf8, but we found an abundance of sulfurized isoprenoids. Greenland\u2019s relatively high overall desulfurization yield suggests that sulfurization in Brayas\xf8 occurs in under 40 years.

[u'A comparative assessment of octanol-water partitioning and distribution constant estimation methods for perfluoroalkyl carboxylates and sulfonates', ['Sierra Rayne', 'Kaya Forest'], u'2009-05-29', u'New experimental data is available in the literature regarding the octanol-water distribution behavior of representative straight chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylate (PFCA) and sulfonate (PFSA) congeners. The current study provides the first investigation into the predictive ability of various software programs for estimating the corresponding octanol-water partitioning (log P) and distribution (log D) constants of PFCAs and PFSAs. Wide predictive variation was found within and between the various methods. Several programs were able to accurately estimate the log P/D fragmental contributions of a -CF2- group for PFCAs, as well as the associated Gibbs free energies for partitioning into octanol from water due to the hydrophobic character of the perfluoroalkyl chain (\u0394hydrophobicGow). Only the SPARC log D method accurately predicted the electrostatic contributions of the carboxylate head group (\u0394electrostaticGow) towards octanol-water partitioning for PFCAs. Similar log D values and organic carbon normalized sediment-water partitioning coefficients (Koc) for PFCAs and PFSAs having equivalent perfluoroalkyl chain lengths suggests potentially equivalent \u0394electrostaticGow and \u0394hydrophobicGow contributions towards lipophilic partitioning for these two contaminant classes at near neutral pH values, regardless of head group identity.

Application of five established models for estimating bioconcentration factors (BCFs) were applied to the PFSA and PFCA log Kow and log D data and compared to available field and laboratory BCF data. Wide variability was observed between the methods for estimating log Kow and log D values, ranging up to several log units for particular congeners, and which was further compounded by additional variability introduced by the different BCF equations applied. With the exception of n-perfluorooctanecarboxylic acid (n-PFOA), whose experimental BCF was poorly modeled by all approaches, the experimental BCF values of the other PFSA and PFCA congeners were reasonably approximated by the ALOGPS log P values in combination with any of the five log Kow based BCF equations. The SPARC and KOWWIN log Kow and log D values provided generally less accurate BCF estimates regardless of the BCF equation applied. However, the SPARC Kow values did provide BCF estimates for PFSA congeners with errors <0.3 log units using any of the five BCF equations. Model lipophilic and proteinophilic solvent based distribution constant calculations for the PFSA and PFCA congeners with experimental BCFs exhibited similar relationships with their corresponding BCF values. For longer chain PFCA and PFSA congeners, increasing hydrophobicity of the perfluoroalkyl chain appears to be driving corresponding increases in BCF values. Perfluorooalkyl sulfonamides are expected to display similar chain length and branching pattern influences on BCFs, but no experimental data are currently available upon which to validate the estimated values which range widely between the various approaches by up to 10 log units. The amidic proton acidity on primary and secondary perfluoroalkyl sulfonamides will play a significant role in the partitioning of these compounds with both abiotic and biotic organic matter, and will need to be taken into account when assessing their environmental and biological fate.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/3256/version/1', [u'Chemistry', u'Earth & Environment'], [u'Ecologica Research', u'Okanagan College']]

It has ushered as a new interdisciplinary field by converging various science disciplines, and is highly relevant to agricultural and food systems.  Environmental Protection Agency of USA defined nanotechnology as the understanding and control of matter at dimensions of roughly 1-100 nm, where unique physical properties make novel applications possible. By this definition all soil-clays, many chemicals derived from soil organic matter (SOM), several soil microorganisms fall into this category. Apart from native soil-materials, many new nanotech products are entering into soil system, some of which are used for agricultural production and some others for many other purposes.Nano-science (also nanotechnology) has found applications in controlling release of nitrogen, characterization of soil minerals, studies of weathering of soil minerals and soil development, micro-morphology of soils, nature of soil rhizosphere, nutrient ion transport in soil-plant system, emission of dusts and aerosols from agricultural soil and their nature, zeoponics, and precision water farming. In its stride, nanotechnology converges soil mineralogy with imaging techniques, artificial intelligence, and encompass bio molecules and polymers with microscopic atoms and molecules, and macroscopic properties (thermodynamics) with microscopic properties (kinetics, wave theory, uncertainty principles, etc.), to name a few. Some of the examples include clinoloptolite and other zeolite based substrates, and Fe-, Mn-, and Cu- substituted synthetic hydroxyapatites that have made it possible to grow crops in space stations and at Antarctica. This has eliminated costs of repeated launching of space crafts. A disturbing fact is that the fertilizer use efficiency is 20-50 percent for nitrogen, and 10-25 percent for phosphorus (<1% for rock phosphate in alkaline calcareous soils). With nano-fertilizers emerging as alternatives to conventional fertilizers, build ups of nutrients in soils and thereby eutrophication and drinking water contamination may be eliminated. In fact, nano-technology has opened up new opportunities to improve nutrient use efficiency and minimize costs of environmental protection.

[u'On the 7-azaindole in acetonitrile anhydrous solutions as an inappropriate photophysical model for DNA base pairs', ['Javier Catalan'], u'2009-04-19', u'Multiple Hydrogen-bonding is a fundamental issue to explain base-pairing in DNA structures, which was firstly described by Watson and Crick1 using stable keto tautomer forms. In their analysis, they considered the possibility of mutations via proton transfer reactions within a base pair. Such reactions can be induced by electronic excitation, for example, adenine-cytosine mispairing may be caused by double-proton phototautomerism.2 The 7-azaindole (7AI) doubly-hydrogen bonded dimer was firstly proposed as a suitable model for explaining the DNA base mispairing owing to excited state two-proton phototautomerization in 1969 by Taylor et al.3 The concerted nature of this excited state biprotonic transfer has been strongly supported by available evidence (see references 4-6 and references therein). Recently, Kwon and Zewail7 (K&Z) have reported femtosec time-resolved evidence on the stepwise mechanism in polar solvents, using very concentrated solutions of 7AI (0.1 M) in anhydrous acetonitrile, diethylether and dichloromethane on excitation at 320 nm. However, based on a careful spectroscopic analysis of the absorption and emission spectra of anhydrous 0.1 M 7-azaindole solutions in acetonitrile and butyronitrile, we demonstrate in this letter that the 7AI molecule does not form the doubly hydrogen bonded dimer at room temperature (rt) in acetonitrile, but it does generate another aggregate which emits fluorescence at ca. 500 nm. Consequently, the assertion of Kwon and Zewail7,8  that the rate of proton transfer in 7-azaindole dimers is significantly dependent on the solvent polarity and its stepwise mechanism for the process is not rightly stated as no C2h dimer is formed in the medium used to record their femtosecond time resolved and fluorescence spectroscopic evidence (viz. 7-azaindole 0.1 M solution in  acetonitrile at rt).

We found that peptide masses mapped on a plane made by two parameters derived from Mmono and Mav form a peculiar global feature in form of a band-gap 5-7 ppm wide stretching across the whole peptide galaxy, with a narrow (FWHM 0.2 ppm) line in the centre. The a priori probability of such a feature to emerge by chance is less than 1:100. Peptides contributing to the central line have elemental compositions following the rules S=0; Z = (2C \u2013 N \u2013 H)/2 =0, which nine out of 20 amino acid residues satisfy. The relative abundances of amino acids in the peptides contributing to the central line correlate with the consensus order of emergence of these amino acids, with ancient amino acids being overrepresented in on-line peptides. Thus the central line is a relic of ancient life, and likely a signature of its emergence in abiotic synthesis. The linear correlation between Mav and Mmono reduces the complexity of polypeptide molecules, which may have increased the rate of their abiotic production. This, in turn may have influenced the selection of these amino acid residues for terrestrial life. Assuming the line feature is not spurious, life has emerged from elements with isotopic abundances very close to terrestrial levels, which rules out most of the Galaxy.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/2402/version/1', [u'Chemistry', u'Evolutionary Biology'], [u'Uppsala University, Institute for Molecular and Cell Biology']]

The presence of higher than expected concentrations of siderophile elements (Ni, Co, Pt etc) in the earth\u2019s mantle, iron enrichment of the lower mantle relative to the upper mantle, and a possible carbon flux from the core suggest the possibility of continual long-term exchange of materials between the core and the mantle. The chemical interactions of molten iron with complex mantle oxides and diffusion have been postulated as key mechanisms. A number of studies have been carried out on the reduction reactions taking into account the extreme conditions of high-temperature and high-pressure in earth\u2019s interior. These studies have, however, neglected to consider the influence of carbon on these reactions. The earth\u2019s metallic core is rich in carbon (~ 5 wt% C), and there is a growing evidence for the presence of carbon in the earth\u2019s mantle as well.

Iron induced reduction of alumina in the absence of carbon, has been previously reported to occur only at pressures above 60 GPa and temperatures of 2,200K.

[u'On the Doubly hydrogen bonded dimer of 7-azaindole (0.1 M) as a model for DNA base pairs in acetonitrile solutions at rt', ['Javier Catalan'], u'2008-05-29', u'Multiple H-bonded base-pairing as a fundamental element of DNA structure was first described by Watson and Crick using stable keto tautomer forms. In their analysis, they considered the possibility of mutations via tautomeric proton transfer shifts. Among other phenomena, such shifts can be caused by electronic excitation; for example, anomalous adenine-cytosine pairing may be a result of two-proton phototautomerism. One suitable model base pair for two-proton translocating tautomerization is the C2h dimer of 7-azaindole (7AI) proposed by Taylor et al. in 1969. The most salient contribu\xaction of their work was that the double proton transfer in such a dimer occurs in a concerted manner. After the strong controversy raised in 1995 by the proposal of Douhal et al. of a stepwise mechanism for the process was overcome, its concerted nature has been strongly supported by available evidence (see references and references therein). Very recently, however, Kwon and Zewail claimed to have obtained new supportive evidence that the proton phototransfer in 7AI dimer in polar solvents is in fact a stepwise rather than concerted process. In this communication, we conducted a systematic spectroscopic study of the dimerization of 7AI at a 0.1 M concentration in acetonitrile that may allow us to demonstrate whether the 0.1 M 7AI solutions in acetonitrile at room temperature used by Kwon and Zewail contained enough 7AI doubly hydrogen bonded dimer to enable its photoselection and hence its photophysical characterization with femtosecond / fluorescence spectroscopy.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/1926/version/1', [u'Chemistry'], [u'Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Quimica Fisica Aplicada']]

This conclusion is also supported by an elementary mathematical approach, which re-examines the work done in the four individual steps of the cycle. An important consequence of this is that the concept of entropy, originally proposed on the basis of the Carnot theorem, may not be a fundamentally valid thermodynamic quantity. Also, the experimental approach generally adopted in the determination of entropy is questionable, and the importance of increasing randomness in natural processes not universally valid.

Furlong'], u'2008-04-28', u'Tautomerism in organic chemistry has been extensively studied in condensed phase by spectrometric methods, mainly by IR and NMR techniques. Mass spectrometry studies start 40 years ago but just recently it has been recognized the importance of the mass spectral data for the study of tautomerism in the gas phase.Mass spectrometry can provide valuable information in regard to tautomeric equilibria when studying mass spectra among the members of different families of organic compounds.The relevance of the mass spectral data resides on several facts but there are two that are of key importance:1- Mass spectral fragmentation assignments should be tautomer specific since the corresponding abundances ratios are supposed to be correlated to the keto/enol contents.2- Ionization in the ion source is supposed to have no effect on the position of the equilibrium so that the results reflect the tautomers content in the gas phase previous to ionization.Some of the carbonylic compounds do not exhibit noticeable tautomerism so the fragment abundances assigned to the enol form is very low or not measurable. Since enolization is more noticeable in the case of thio-derivatives (which correlates adequately with the oxygenated analogues), the study of their mass spectra is an interesting choice to reach some degree of generalization. In addition, experimental findings are supported by semiempirical theoretical calculations, which probed to be adequate not only for supporting tendency correlations among the members of a compound family but also to calculate heats of tautomerization in gas phase.Reports using mass spectrometry for tautomerism are becoming less common. One of the reasons is that now it would appear that the interpretation of MS results is not as straightforward as it was once believed, even though in a recent review it was written that: \u201cMass spectrometry is the most informative and practical method for studying and identifying tautomers in the gas phase\u201d [1].

In order to verify whether or not OHcyE could reach their saturation limit in the vascular tissue, we have measured the solubility of homocystine in physiological-like condition.Materials and methods The solubility of homocystine has been measured in aqueous sodium chloride solutions at 37 \xb0C by differential pulse polarography based on the reduction of homocystine to homocysteine.Results We have estimated that the concentration achieved by OHcyE in injured coronary artery tissue is at least near-saturating, because the solubility of homocystine in physiological-like condition, above which deposition of homocystine and/or cysteine-homocysteine as solid phase occurs, almost exactly matches its value. Near-saturation levels of OHcyE within the vascular tissue means that significant leakage of intracellular fluid can promote OHcyE crystallization in tissue fluids, which may serve to initiate inflammation. Conclusions We speculate that deposition of OHcyE crystals could damage blood vessels and act as a primer of homocysteine-triggered inflammation, thus being along the causal pathway that leads to vascular dysfunction.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/1436/version/1', [u'Chemistry', u'Pharmacology'], [u'Department of Chemistry, University Federico II of Naples', u'Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Second University of Naples']]
[u'Prehistoric psychotropic consumption in Andean Chilean mummies', ['Juan P. Ogalde', 'Bernardo T. Arriaza', 'Elia Soto'], u'2007-11-29', u'Hallucinogenic plants are often regarded as the main source of psychoactive drugs in antiquity to reach deep altered states of consciousness1,2. Many researchers believe this was particularly true during the Tiwanaku empire expansion, circa (500-1000 A.D.), along the Atacama Desert of Chile. Highly decorated snuffing tablets and tubes are often found as grave goods during this period3,4,5,6,7,8. Until now the type of drugs consumed in this paraphernalia has been unclear. From the modern city of Arica, naturally mummified human bodies with abundant hair provided a unique opportunity to test for hallucinogenic plants consumed in Andean prehistory. Analysis by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry demonstrated the presence of harmine. The Banisteriopsis vine, commonly called Ayahuasca, was the probable source. This is the first confirmed evidence of psychoactive plant consumption in pre-Hispanic Andean populations along the Atacama coastal region. Of the 32 mummy hair samples analyzed 3 males tested positive for harmine. This alkaloid aids in the catalysis and synergic effects of powerful hallucinogenic drugs. The consumption of harmine was likely related to medicinal practices and not exclusively ingested by shamans. Another important aspect of this evidence is that Banisteriopsis is an Amazon plant. It does not grow in the Atacama coastal region. Thus, our findings reveal extensive plant trade networks in antiquity between the coast, desert, highlands, and Amazon basin. The excellent preservation of human organic specimens, the use of gas chromatography and mass spectrometry allowed us to map and demonstrate the consumption of psychoactive compound plants in Andean prehistory. In addition, our findings open the door for future studies to debate the consumption and social role of ancient psychoactive and hallucinogenic plants.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/1368/version/1', [u'Chemistry', u'Pharmacology'], [u'Universidad de Tarapaca', u'Universidad Arturo Prat, Ciencias Quimicas y farmaceuticas']]

These plants are found in temperate and tropical regions worldwide, often grow in areas of marginal agricultural capacity, and have a long history of use by indigenous peoples for medicinal and other uses. The research efforts on sumac extracts to date indicate a promising potential for this plant family to provide renewable bioproducts with the following reported desirable bioactivities: antifibrogenic, antifungal, antiinflammatory, antimalarial, antimicrobial, antimutagenic, antioxidant, antithrombin, antitumorigenic, antiviral, cytotoxic, hypoglycaemic, and leukopenic. As well, the bioactive components can be extracted from the plant material using environmentally benign solvents that allow for both food and industrial end-uses. The favorable worldwide distribution of sumac also suggests that desirable bioproducts may be obtained at source, with minimal transportation requirements from the source through processing to end consumer. However, previous work has focussed on only a few members of this large plant family. In addition, not all of the species studied to date have been fully characterized for potential bioactive components and bioactivities.

However, the role of thiols might be mediated by the formation of corresponding S-nitrosothiols, and a redox process is responsible for the nitrates\u2019 degradation: an enzyme, probably the cytochrome P450, is involved in vivo. Here, we report evidence that, in vitro, no reaction between thiols and alkyl nitrates takes place, but that stronger reducing agents, such as iron (II) derivatives, are necessary: alkoxy radicals and the nitrite anion are the reaction intermediates. The latter, in slightly acidic conditions, for instance mimicking ischemic conditions, is shown to nitrosilate thiols to the corresponding S-nitrosothiols: the real NO suppliers. Therefore, the direct release of NO from nitrates is excluded.

Because of limited adoption of tools that seamlessly integrate all aspects of a research project (conception, data generation, data evaluation, peer-reviewing and publishing of conclusions), much effort is later spent on reproducing or reformatting individual entities before they can be repurposed independently or as parts of articles.We propose that workflows \u2013 performed both individually and collaboratively \u2013 could potentially become more efficient if all steps of the research cycle were coherently represented online and the underlying data were formatted, annotated and licensed for reuse. Such a system would accelerate the process of taking projects from conception to publication stages and allow for continuous updating of the data sets and their interpretation as well as their integration into other independent projects.A major advantage of such workflows is the increased transparency, both with respect to the scientific process as to the contribution of each participant. The latter point is important from a perspective of motivation, as it enables the allocation of reputation, which creates incentives for scientists to contribute to projects. Such workflow platforms offering possibilities to fine-tune the accessibility of their content could gradually pave the path from the current static mode of research presentation intoa more coherent practice of open science.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/6066/version/1', [u'Data Standards'], [u'Institute for Molecular Infection Biology, University of W\xfcrzburg, Germany; Research Centre for Infectious Diseases, University of W\xfcrzburg, Germany ', u'Julius K\xfchn-Institute, Federal Research Center for Cultivated Plants, Berlin, Germany', u'Cellular Therapy and Transplantation (CTT)', u'Department of Anatomy with Radiology, University of Auckland', u'Science 3.0']]

[u'InterPro Curation: Integrating Predictive Protein Signatures Into Biological Hierarchies', ['Sarah Burge'], u'2010-11-25', u'InterPro is an integrated database of predictive protein signatures used for the classification and automatic annotation of proteins and genomes. As InterPro curators, we are responsible for assimilating information from our member databases and communicating it to our end users in a way that adds value to each individual signature. We categorise signatures according to their type (for example, Family, Domain or Repeat) and annotate entries with links to other databases, abstracts and protein matches.The InterPro database also identifies relationships between entries. For example, signatures at a general Family level are related to more specific subfamilies through a Parent/Child relationship. Families may also Contain individual Domains. In this manner, we aim to build up a hierarchy of InterPro entries that correctly represents relationships between biological families and domains. Users may then easily identify related proteins and signatures as the InterPro database attempts to map out biological hierarchies. Here we discuss InterPro relations, the criteria for their formation and how they may be useful to users.  We will also discuss the challenges of representing biological hierarchies when automating relationship formation and the role manual curation plays in ensuring that we accurately represent biological networks.

[u'A Unified Approach for Representing Structurally-Complex Models in SBML Level 3', ['Robert Muetzelfeldt'], u'2010-04-22', u'The aim of this document is to explore a unified approach to handling several of the proposed extensions to the SBML Level 3 Core specification.   The approach is illustrated with reference to Simile, a modelling environment which appears to have most of the capabilities of the various SBML Level 3 package proposals which deal with model structure.   Simile (http://www.simulistics.com) is a visual modelling environment for continuous systems modelling which includes the ability to handle complex disaggregation of model structure, by allowing the modeller to specify classes of object and the relationships between them.The note is organised around the 6 packages listed on the SBML Level 3 Proposals web page (http://sbml.org/Community/Wiki/SBML_Level_3_Proposals) which deal with model structure, namely comp, arrays, spatial, geom, dyn and multi.   For each one, I consider how the requirements which motivated the package can be handled using Simile\u2019s unified approach.   Although Simile has a declarative model-representation language (in both Prolog and XML syntax), I use Simile diagrams and equation syntax throughout, since this is more compact and readable than large chunks of XML.The conclusion is that Simile can indeed meet most of the requirements of these various packages, using a generic set of constructs \u2013 basically, the multiple-instance submodel, the concept of a relationship (association) between submodels, and array variables.   This suggests the possibility of having a single SBML Level 3 extension package similar to the Simile data model, rather than a series of separate packages.   Such an approach has a number of potential advantages and disadvantages compared with having the current set of discrete packages: these are discussed in this paper.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/4372/version/1', [u'Bioinformatics', u'Data Standards'], [u'Simulistics Ltd']]

[u'Human neuromaturation, juvenile extreme energy liability, and adult cognition/cooperation ', ['John Skoyles'], u'2012-04-02', u'Human childhood and adolescence is the period in which adult cognitive competences (including those that create the unique cooperativeness of humans) are acquired. It is also a period when neural development puts a juvenile\u2019s survival at risk due to the high vulnerability of their brain to energy shortage. The brain of a 4 year-old human uses \u224850% of its total energy expenditure (TEE) (cf. adult \u224812%). This brain expensiveness is due to (1) the brain making up \u22486% of a 4 year-old body compared to 2% in an adult, and (2) increased energy metabolism that is \u2248100% greater in the gray matter of a child than in an adult (a result of the extra costs of synaptic neuromaturation).

This refines inter- and intraarea neural networks so they become structured with economical \u201csmall world\u201d connectivity attributes (such as hub organization and high cross-brain differentiation/integration). Once acquired, this connectivity enables highly complex adult cognitive capacities. Humans evolved as hunter-gatherers. Contemporary hunter-gatherers (and it is also likely Middle Paleolithic ones) pool high energy foods in an egalitarian manner that reliably supported mothers and juveniles with high energy intake. This type of sharing unique to humans protects against energy shortage happening to the immature brain. This cooperation that protects neuromaturation arises from adults having the capacity to communicate and evaluate social reputation, cognitive skills that exist as a result of extended neuromaturation. Human biology is therefore characterized by a presently overlooked bioenergetic-cognition loop (called here the \u201cHEBE ring\u201d) by which extended neuromaturation creates the cooperative abilities in adults that support juveniles through the potentially vulnerable period of the neurodevelopment needed to become such adults.

[u'Diet transition to a high-fat diet for 3 weeks reduces brain omega-3-fatty acid levels, alters BDNF signaling and induces anxiety & depression-like behavior in adult rats', ['Sandeep Sharma', 'Yumei Zhuang', 'Fernando Gomez-Pinilla'], u'2012-02-28', u'Background: The consumption of diets high in calories and low in nutrient value is becoming increasingly common in modern society, which can lead to metabolic disorders like diabetes and obesity, and potentially to psychiatric disorders. We have performed studies to assess how the shift from a healthy diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids to a diet rich in saturated fatty acid affects the substrates for brain plasticity and function, and anxiety and depression-like behavior. Methods: Pregnant rats were fed with omega-3 supplemented diet from their 2nd day of gestation period as well as their male pups for 12 weeks. Afterwards, the animals were randomly assigned to either a group fed on the same diet or a group fed on a high-fat diet (HFD) rich in saturated fats for 3 weeks. Anxiety and depression-like behaviors were assessed by using open field (OF) and elevated plus maze (EPM). Molecular assessments were performed in the frontal cortex and hippocampus as dysfunctions in these brain regions are main contributors towards depression, anxiety-like behavior and stress. Results: We found that the HFD increased vulnerability for anxiety and depression-like behavior, and that these modifications harmonized with changes in the anxiety-related neuropeptide Y (NPY)-1 receptor. The HFD reduced levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and the BDNF signaling receptor pTrkB, as well as the cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB), in these brain regions. Brain DHA contents were significantly associated with the levels of anxiety and depression-like behavior in these rats. Conclusions: These results suggest that the change in dietary lifestyle leading to alteration of dietary n3/n-6 fatty acids levels imposes a risk factor for anxiety-like behaviors. Dietary DHA might help for building cognitive reserve that can resist psychiatric disorders.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/6950/version/1', [u'Developmental Biology', u'Neuroscience', u'Pharmacology'], [u'University of California at Los Angeles, Department of Physiological Science']]

As early improvement of glicaemic control is observed after bariatric surgeries, there is currently a search for surgical procedures that can promote euglycemia also in non-obese patients. Glicaemic control can be achieved by increasing the blood concentration of GLP-1, a hormone produced by L cells that are more densely concentrated in the terminal ileum. The interposition of ileal segment to a more anterior region (proximal jejunum) can promote a greater stimulation of the L cells by poorly digested food, increasing the production of GLP-1 and reflecting on glicaemic control.AIMS: To investigate long-term histological modifications of intestinal mucosa of rats submitted to interposition of ileum segment to a proximal region (jejunum).METHODS: Forty 8-week old male Wistar-EPM1 rats (Rattus norvegicus albinus) were randomly distributed into 3 groups: the Interposition Group (IG) was subjected to ileal interposition, the Sham Group (SG) was subjected to sham operations, and the Control Group (CG) was not subjected to surgery. All animals were followed until the 60th postoperative day (8 postoperative week) when they were euthanized. Segments of jejunum and ileum from all groups were collected and analyzed by optical microscopy and immunohistochemistry.RESULTS: No structural nor histological changes in intestinal L cells in the interposed intestinal segment and other intestinal segments were noted after ileal interposition surgery.

At present, there is a need for a surgical procedure that is effective for the treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2, even in non-obese individuals. The isolated ileal transposition theory could lead to an effective alternative therapy. This intervention has not yet been performed in humans, and there are no reports of its use in an experimental model of diet-induced metabolic syndrome. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to evaluate the physiological effects of ileal transposition in rats with diet-induced metabolic syndrome. The effects of this procedure on glucose and lipid metabolism will be assessed. METHODS: Forty 12-week-old male rats (albino Rattus norvegicus, Wistar, 2BAW, heterogeneous) will be divided into four groups of 10 animals each: the ileal transposition group (TG) comprising animals on a hypercaloric-hyperlipidic diet; the sham group (SG) containing animals that receive the same diet and undergo the sham surgery; control group 1 (CG1), which will receive a hypercaloric-hyperlipidic diet and will not undergo surgery; and control group 2 (CG2), which will consume standard feed and will not undergo surgery. The surgeries will be performed in 20-week-old animals. Blood samples for laboratory testing will be collected from 12-week-old animals on the day of surgery and after eight postoperative weeks, following determination of the weights of the animals and the administration of anesthesia. The levels of serum glucose, insulin, triglycerides, total cholesterol and fractions, glucagon-like peptide-1, C-peptide and glycated hemoglobin will be assessed in all of the animals. The insulin tolerance test will be performed using PRISMA software, and insulin resistance will be calculated by the HOMA-IR indirect test. On specific days, two 20-week-old rats will be separated and randomly distributed in TG and SG. These animals will be followed until the eighth postoperative week. Subsequently, they will be euthanized, and the retroperitoneal and periepididymal fat deposits will be collected and weighed using a precision scale.

Despite increased stem cell proliferation, axogenesis, synaptogenesis and neuroprotection were hampered, leading to disruption of the mossy fiber pathway and to atrophy of the dentate gyrus during aging. Here, NF-\u03baB controls the transcription of FOXO1 and PKA, regulating axogenesis. Structural defects culminated in behavioral impairments in pattern separation. Re-activation of NF-\u03baB resulted in integration of newborn neurons, finally to regeneration of the dentate gyrus, accompanied by a complete recovery of structural and behavioral defects.

The search for a more accurate method to evaluate obesity and to indicate a better treatment is important in the world health context. BMI (body mass index) is considered the main criteria for obesity treatment and BSI. Nevertheless, the fat excess related to the percentage of Body Fat (%BF) is actually the principal harmful factor in obesity disease that is usually neglected. This paper presents a new fuzzy mechanism for evaluating obesity by associating BMI with %BF that yields a fuzzy obesity index for obesity evaluation and treatment and allows building up a Fuzzy Decision Support System (FDSS) for BSI. Methods: Seventy-two patients were evaluated for both BMI and %BF. These data are modified and treated as fuzzy sets. Afterwards, the BMI and %BF classes are aggregated yielding a new index (MAFOI) for input linguistic variable are considered the BMI and %BF, and as output linguistic variable is employed the MAFOI, an obesity classification with entirely new classes of obesity in the fuzzy context as well as is used for BSI. Results: There is gradual, smooth obesity classification and BSI when using the proposed fuzzy obesity index when compared with other traditional methods for dealing with obesity.Conclusion: The BMI is not adequate for surgical indication in all the conditions and  fuzzy logic becomes an alternative for decision making in bariatric surgery indication based on the MAFOI.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/5516/version/2', [u'Developmental Biology', u'Molecular Cell Biology'], [u'Federal University of Sao Paulo, Brazil']]

Here, through a panel of poly-L-lysine micropatterns, we wished to assay how external geometrical constraints of neurons may modulate axonal polarization. Constraints applied to either the cell body or to the neurite directions revealed the existence of a differential mechanical tension between the nascent axon and other neurites. Also, we show that centrosome location is not predictive of axonal polarization but responds to the force exerted by the nascent axon. Using curved trajectories for neurite growth inhibited axonal differentiation and prevented formation of multiple axons normally induced by cytochalasin or taxol treatments. Finally we provide evidence that microtubules act as curvature sensors during neuronal differentiation.

Some of this adaptability comes from ubiquitin-mediated protein destruction regulated by cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases (CRLs). CRLs are activated through modification of the cullin subunit with the ubiquitin-like protein RUB/NEDD8 by an E3 ligase called defective in cullin neddylation 1 (DCN1). Here we show that tobacco DCN1 binds ubiquitin and RUB/NEDD8, and associates with cullin. When knocked down by RNAi, tobacco pollen formation stopped and zygotic embryogenesis was blocked around the globular stage. Additionally, we found that RNAi of DCN1 inhibited the stress-triggered reprogramming of cultured microspores from their intrinsic gametophytic mode of development to an embryogenic state. This stress-induced developmental switch is a known feature in many important crops and leads ultimately to the formation of haploid embryos and plants. Compensating the RNAi effect by re-transformation with a promoter-silencing construct restored pollen development and zygotic embryogenesis, as well as the ability for stress-induced formation of embryogenic microspores. Overexpression of DCN1, however, accelerated pollen tube growth and increased the potential for microspore reprogramming.

[u'The Size-Weight Illusion Is Not an Illusion When Picking the Best Objects to Throw', ['Qin Zhu', 'Geoffrey Bingham'], u'2010-06-28', u'Heaviness perception involves a misperception of weight known, since the 19th century, as the Size-Weight Illusion 1. The larger of two objects of equal mass is reported to be lighter than the smaller when they are lifted. The illusion has been found to be reliable and robust. It persists even when people know that the masses are equal and handle objects properly 2. It has been exhibited by children of only 2 years of age 3,4. All this suggests that the effect might be intrinsic to humans. Although different hypotheses have been advanced to account for the illusion over the 100+ years it has been studied 5-11, its origin remains unknown. More recently, people&apos;s perception of optimal objects for long distance throwing was found to exhibit a size-weight relation similar to the illusion 12,13, greater weights were picked for larger objects and they were indeed thrown to the greatest distances. Here we show that the perception of heaviness (including the illusion) and perception of optimal objects for long distance throwing are in fact equivalent. Thus, the size-weight illusion has a useful application: optimal objects for throwing are picked by a thrower as having a particular heaviness, which is the best heaviness learned when learning to throw 14,15. Long distance throwing is a uniquely human ability that is understood to have enabled our species to survive and even thrive during the ice ages 16-22.

[u'A Hypothetic Mechanism of Ordering  and Shaping Cells within Discrete Regions', ['Yaroslav Strokovskyy'], u'2010-03-11', u'We propose a hypothetic mechanism of ordering and shaping cells during C. elegans embryogenesis. The mechanism is based on the assumption that during each round of division of cells, daughter cells acquire electric charges from its mother cells (charge conservation law is taken into account). Between the acts of division, the total electric field, generated by a system of charged cells, change relative positions of the charged cells within the region. In one\u2019s turn, the positions of the charged cells determine the pattern of the electrostatic field. A mathematical model of such self-consistent mechanism is developed.

[u'Homeoprotein Hbx4 represses adhesion molecule governing cytokinesis and development', ['Ji-Sun Kim', 'Ji-Hui Seo', 'Hyung-Soon Yim', 'Sa-Ouk Kang'], u'2010-02-02', u'Homeobox genes encode proteins with a highly conserved DNA-binding motif and provoke morphological diversification of body segments by differentially controlling the expression of downstream targets. Here, we have identified hbx4, one of many homeobox genes in Dictyostelium discoideum and investigated its role during growth and development. In suspension, Hbx4-overexpressing cells, Hbx4OE, showed defects in cytokinesis and growth rate. During development, Hbx4OE and hbx4-disrupting cells, hbx4\xaf made differences in shape of mound and slug, cell-type proportioning from wild type KAx3 cells. These phenotypes were similar to those of mutant defective in cadA encoding Ca2+-dependent cell adhesion molecule so that we investigated the relationship between hbx4 and cadA. Overexpression of Hbx4 inhibited the expression of cadA and cAMP also failed to stimulate cadA in Hbx4OE. Furthermore, gel mobility shift assay showed the promoter of cadA contained Hbx4-binding site, indicating Hbx4 negatively regulates the expression of cadA. Proteome analysis revealed that overexpression of Hbx4 repressed the rdiA and abpB encoding rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor1, RhoGDI1 and actin bundling protein 34, ABP34, respectively. And the overexpression of cadA in Hbx4OE cells rescued the defects and increased mRNA level of rdiA, abpB and one of Rho GTPase, rac1b. These results suggested that Hbx4 can modulate cytokinesis, cell sorting and cell-type proportioning by repressing cadA that regulates GTPase-dependent signaling pathway.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/4194/version/1', [u'Developmental Biology', u'Molecular Cell Biology'], [u'Seoul National University, Laboratory of Biophysics, School of Biological Sciences']]
[u'The hypothesis of basic phenotype modules', ['Thomas von Zelewsky'], u'2010-01-28', u'The evolutionary events that allowed the rapid occurrence of metazoa are still enigmatic. The presumably oldest metazoan fossils are microscopic and occur just above 635 Ma, at the beginning of the Ediacaran period. Upon condition that the lack of macrofossils in the lower Ediacaran strata is real, the assumption of a sudden appearance of already complex, but still small animals that flourished during the first half of the Ediacaran is a reasonable option. Consequently, the emergence of the first macrofossils with metazoan affinity in mid Ediacaran strata would indicate a second leap in animal evolution. Here, these apparent leaps are explained in terms of a new concept of evolvability that is based on well definable developmental modules: A system based on blast cell-induced cell division modules has paved the way for rapid evolution to small multicellular animals. The second module, an ancestral form of segments, allowed the construction of a new sort of metameric body plans that appeared some tenth of million years later and at a larger scale. Based on this new model of basic radiations, the lower Ediacaran strata are predicted to contain a sequence of exotic embryos that is followed by an explosion of small metazoan diversity. The upper Ediacaran biota are interpreted as representatives of an evolutionary succession that culminated in a maximally evolvable and segmented ancestor with an already complex archetype body plan. Then, around the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary branching of most modern animal phyla would have taken place, with extensive secondary simplifications in many groups. This radically new hypothesis allows the formulation of clear predictions that are in agreement with available fossils and geochemical data from that period, however, it calls for a precise and chronologically well-definable sequence of Ediacaran events that can only be confirmed through future investigations.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/4189/version/1', [u'Developmental Biology', u'Evolutionary Biology'], [u'D\xe9partement de Biologie, Universit\xe9 de Fribourg, Chemin du Mus\xe9e 10, CH-1700 Fribourg, Suisse']]

Further there is a consecutive formation of organisms due to aggregation of similar structures: blastaea; segmentella, supersegmentella. Supersegmentella gave development to tunicates, hemichordates, chordates like lancelet and to predecessors of vertebrata. Segmentation of organisms is determined by aggregation of supergastraeas into one integrated. Symmetry is determined by structure-forming quality of extracellular matrix. Symmetry of primary organisms was radial; then radial-bilateral, and the first plane of symmetry divided the organism into dorsal and ventral sides. With the arrangement of supergastraeas in a line radial-two-plane symmetry consistently formed. Radial-three-plane symmetry formed by association of two segmentellas by posterior edges. The third plane of symmetry divided the organism into anterior and posterior antimeres. From extracellular matrix originated mesogloea, and then a chord; endodermic embolies gave development to the primary gut; ectodermic embolies after the concentration there earlier diffusely located nervous cells transformed first into a trench, and then into a tubular nervous system; the condensed nervous fabric of aboral poles gave development to the central nervous system.

Design:  Whether the combinations of correlations among energy and main components in the hypothetical lipid-ratio variation model (L-varied model), which reflects the invariant lipid-free composition, are consistent with those in the practical mammal meats?

We designed to solve these questions and compare those results. Results: These combinations of their correlations between the theoretical model and practical meats stated above were consistent with each other.

[u'Animal emergence during Snowball Earths by thermosynthesis in submarine hydrothermal vents', ['Anthonie W. J. Muller'], u'2009-06-18', u'Darwin already commented on the lateness in the fossil record of the emergence of the animals, calling it a valid argument against his theory of evolution1. This emergence of the animals (metazoans: multicellular animals) has therefore attracted much attention2-5. Two decades ago it was reported that extensive global glaciations (Snowball Earths) preceded the emergence6-7. Here we causally relate the emergence and the glaciations by invoking benthic sessile8-11 thermosynthesizing12-13 protists that gained free energy as ATP while oscillating in the thermal gradient between a submarine hydrothermal vent14 and the ice-covered ocean. During a global glaciation their size increased from microscopic to macroscopic due to the selective advantage of a larger span of the thermal gradient. At the glaciation\u2019s end the ATP-generating mechanisms reversed and used ATP to sustain movement. Lastly, by functioning as animal organs, these protists then through symbiogenesis15-17 brought forth the first animals. This simple and straightforward scenario for the emergence of animals accounts for their large organ and organism size and their use of ATP, embryo and epigenetic control of development. The presented hypothesis is testable by collecting organisms near today\u2019s submarine hydrothermal vents and studying their behaviour in thermal gradients easily constructed in the laboratory.

Aging as a result of accumulation of \u2018faults\u2019 on cellular and molecular levels, has been proposed in the damage (fault)-accumulation theory by Kirkwood 2006. However, this theory fails to explain some aging phenotypes such as fibrosis and premature aging, since terms such as \u2018damage\u2019 and \u2018fault\u2019 are not specified. Therefore we introduce here a specification of the underlying mechanism of aging and arrive at a novel theory: aging of the body is a result of the accumulation of Misrepair of tissue. It emphasizes: a) it is Misrepair, not the original damage, that accumulates and leads to aging; and b) aging can occur at different levels, however aging of the body takes place at least on the tissue level, but not necessarily on cellular/molecular level. The novel concept of Misrepair introduced here unifies the understanding of the roles of environmental damage, repair, gene regulation, and multicellular structure in the aging process.

In nature, aesthetic appreciation thereof has given rise to the mathematical search for good series (e.g. the Fibonacci series) and proportions (e.g. the Golden proportion) as important elements of beauty.

Birkhoff equation defines the aesthetic value as the amount of order divided by the complexity of the product. These two features can be measured easily in poetry, music, painting, architecture, etc. In the fine arts, it is the artist who manipulates both these features, but how does nature manage order and complexity in living organisms or their parts? Here we show how Birkhoff equation, applied to the mammalian vascular system of eight representative animals, results in new insights into the organization of the animal vascular system. We found that order and complexity are highly correlated in the mammalian vascular system (R2=0.9511). Accordingly, in nature both features are not independently managed in the manner of artists. We found significant differences among the Birkhoff aesthetic values in the mammalian arterial system, whereas no such differences exist in the venous system.

The array included genes that are involved in the actions of adrenal and sex steroids, thyroid hormone, and xenobiotic responses.

A perplexing property of lamprey is that 15\u03b1-hydroxy-steroids are active steroids.  For example, 15\u03b1-hydroxy-estradiol [15\u03b1-OH-E2] is the estrogen, instead of estradiol (E2).  To investigate how 15\u03b1-OH-E2 binds lamprey ER, we constructed a 3D model of the lamprey ER with E2 and 15\u03b1-OH-E2.  Our 3D model shows that S\u03b4 on Met-409 can form a hydrogen bond with the 15\u03b1-hydroxyl on 15\u03b1-OH-E2.  In human ER\u03b1, the corresponding residue Ile-424 has a van der Waals contact with 15\u03b1-OH-E2.  BLAST analysis of GenBank indicates that among vertebrate ERs, only lamprey ER contains a methionine at this position.  Thus, the contact between S\u03b4 on Met-409 and 15\u03b1-OH-E2 is unique.  Our 3D model of lamprey ER should prove useful in virtual screening of chemical libraries to identify compounds for controlling reproduction in sea lamprey, an environmental pest in the Great Lakes in the USA.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/2768/version/1', [u'Developmental Biology', u'Ecology', u'Earth & Environment'], [u'University of California, San Diego']]
[u'Kinetic control of eukaryotic chromatin structure by recursive topological restraints', ['Dominika Borek', 'Zbyszek Otwinowski'], u'2008-12-17', u'Chromatin structure undergoes many changes during the cell cycle and in response to regulatory events. A basic unit of chromatin organization is the nucleosome core particle. However, very little is known about how nucleosomes are arranged into higher-order structures in vivo, even though the efficiency and precision of cell division imply high levels of structural organization. We propose abandoning the current paradigm of chromatin organization based on thermodynamics of the lowest energy state and replace it with the idea of a topologically restrained, high-energy structure. We propose that DNA is subject to a recursive topological restraint, and is anchored by hemicatenates that are part of the chromosomal scaffold. Long-distance cis-regulation of transcription is a natural consequence of recursive topological restraint. This new theory of chromatin structure has a multitude of consequences for key aspects of cellular biology.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/2672/version/1', [u'Developmental Biology', u'Genetics & Genomics', u'Molecular Cell Biology'], [u'UT Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas']]

Atwood'], u'2008-12-16', u'Division of the human zygote leads to the formation of the blastocyst that contains human embryonic stem cells (hESC) which develop into the embryo.  Little is known about the physiological signals that direct hESC division and differentiation during early embryogenesis.  A number of growth factors, including the pregnancy-associated hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), are secreted by trophoblasts1-3 that lie adjacent to the embryoblast in the blastocyst, but it is not known whether these growth factors directly signal the epiblast.  Here we show that hCG promotes the division of embryoblast-derived inner mass cells (hESC), and their differentiation during blastulation and neurulation.  Inhibition of LH/hCG receptor (LHCGR) signaling with P-antisense oligonucleotides suppresses hESC proliferation. Similarly, hESC proliferation can be blocked using an antibody against the extracellular activation site of LHCGR, an effect that is reversed by treatment with hCG.  hCG treatment rapidly upregulates steroidogenic acute regulatory protein-mediated cholesterol transport and the synthesis of progesterone, a neurogenic steroid4,5.  Treatment of hESC colonies with progesterone induces neurulation as demonstrated by the expression of nestin and the formation of columnar neuroectodermal cells that organize into neural tube-like rosettes.  Suppression of progesterone signaling by withdrawing progesterone or treating with the progesterone receptor antagonist RU-486 inhibits the differentiation of hESC colonies into embryoid bodies (blastulation) and rosettes (neurulation).  These results explain the default pathway of hESC differentiation towards a neural stem cell fate in vitro.  Collectively, our findings implicate trophoblastic hCG secretion and signaling via LHCGR on the adjacent embryoblast in the induction of hESC proliferation and differentiation into blastocysts and neurula. This paracrine/juxtacrine signaling by extraembryonic tissues is the commencement of trophic support by placental tissues in the growth and development of the human embryo.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/2671/version/1', [u'Developmental Biology', u'Neuroscience'], [u'University of Wisconsin-Madison', u'OTB Research']]
[u'Estimating body Mass and Nutritional Status from Subadult Hominin Skeletons', ['Gwendolyn Robbins'], u'2008-11-04', u'Hominin body size and shape are key components to reconstructing phylogeny, life history, adaptation, and behavior in ancestral populations1. For adults, geometric properties of the femoral midshaft cross-section are used to infer locomotor behavior2-5, subsistence practices6-7, and functional adaptations8-10. Recently research has focused on patterns of compact bone ontogeny, particularly in regard to changes in bone strength with the acquisition of bipedal locomotion11-13 and examining population differences in ontogenetic trajectories for subadult humans14-16 and Neandertals16. Because femoral midshaft geometry is primarily shaped by biomechanical strains-weight bearing, locomotion, and muscle action-ontogenetic research requires estimates of body mass from the skeleton. Currently we use the width of the distal end of the femur to estimate subadult body mass but articular ends are constrained by pressures for joint congruence. Here I demonstrate the strong and consistent scaling relationship between body mass and femoral torsional strength (J) derived from measurement of midshaft cross-section geometry. Bone ends are most significantly affected by locomotor strain during the second year of life, during the initial acquisition of obligate bipedalism, after that time they are increasingly constrained by joint congruence. Results of a comparison of body mass for body size in prehistoric populations support the hypothesis that the midshaft is also a more sensitive indicator of population differences in body mass and activity levels during ontogeny. The femoral midshaft can be used to detect starvation and growth disruption in past populations because there is a mechano-biological interaction effect whereby disruptions in nutritional, metabolic and hormonal status lead to low body mass and activity levels1, 11-13, 17-22.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/2468/version/1', [u'Developmental Biology', u'Evolutionary Biology'], [u'Department of Anthropology, Appalachian State University, North Carolina, USA']]
[u'Human metabolic adaptations and prolonged expensive neurodevelopment: A review', ['John R. Skoyles'], u'2008-10-30', u'1. After weaning, human hunter-gatherer juveniles receive substantial (\u22483.5-7 MJ day-1), extended (\u224815 years) and reliable (kin and nonkin food pooling) energy provision.2. The childhood (pediatric) and the adult human brain takes a very high share of both basal metabolic rate (BMR) (child: 50-70%; adult: \u224820%) and total energy expenditure (TEE) (child: 30-50%; adult: \u224810%).3. The pediatric brain for an extended period (\u22484-9 years-of-age) consumes roughly 50% more energy than the adult one, and after this, continues during adolescence, at a high but declining rate. Within the brain, childhood cerebral gray matter has an even higher 1.9 to 2.2-fold increased energy consumption. 4. This metabolic expensiveness is due to (i) the high cost of synapse activation (74% of brain energy expenditure in humans), combined with (ii), a prolonged period of exuberance in synapse numbers (up to double the number present in adults). Cognitive development during this period associates with volumetric changes in gray matter (expansion and contraction due to metabolic related size alterations in glial cells and capillary vascularization), and in white matter (expansion due to myelination). 5. Amongst mammals, anatomically modern humans show an unique pattern in which very slow musculoskeletal body growth is followed by a marked adolescent size/stature spurt. This pattern of growth contrasts with nonhuman primates that have a sustained fast juvenile growth with only a minor period of puberty acceleration. The existence of slow childhood growth in humans has been shown to date back to 160,000 BP. 6. Human children physiologically have a limited capacity to protect the brain from plasma glucose fluctuations and other metabolic disruptions. These can arise in adults, during prolonged strenuous exercise when skeletal muscle depletes plasma glucose, and produces other metabolic disruptions upon the brain (hypoxia, hyperthermia, dehydration and hyperammonemia). These are proportional to muscle mass.7. Children show specific adaptations to minimize such metabolic disturbances. (i) Due to slow body growth and resulting small body size, they have limited skeletal muscle mass. (ii) They show other adaptations such as an exercise specific preference for free fatty acid metabolism. (iii) While children are generally more active than adolescents and adults, they avoid physically prolonged intense exertion. 8. Childhood has a close relationship to high levels of energy provision and metabolic adaptations that support prolonged synaptic neurodevelopment.

The traditional view is that the relation between the sound of a word and its meaning is arbitrary. An alternative hypothesis, known as sound symbolism, holds that form-meaning correspondence is systematic. Numerous examples of sound symbolism exist across natural language phyla. Moreover, cross-linguistic similarities suggest that sound symbolism represents a language universal. For example, many unrelated languages affix an "ee" sound to words in order to emphasize size distinctions or express affection (e.g., look at the teeny weeny baby); other such phonetic universals are evident for object mass, color, brightness, and aggression. We hypothesize that sound symbolism reflects sensitivity to an ecological law (i.e., Hooke&apos;s Law) governing an inverse relation between object mass and acoustic resonance. In two experiments healthy adults showed high agreement in matching pure tones to color swatches and nonwords to novel objects as linear functions of frequency and luminance.

Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are compounds which may interfere with the endocrine system, producing effects that may disrupt the physiologic function of hormones. Early research on EDC exposure in humans and wildlife has focused mainly on reproductive effects of estrogenic chemicals, however recent studies have revealed that effects of estrogenic as well as non-estrogen active chemicals are often more far reaching than the reproductive system, and even mild exposures experienced early in development may have detrimental effects that are maintained throughout adulthood. Here we show trenbolone acetate, an androgen active environmental contaminant used as a growth promoter for cattle, to cause a literal silence in Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) chicks following a one time embryonic exposure. Vocalizations were not merely lessened; this is the first study to demonstrate an environmental contaminant to cause a complete abolishment of the ability to vocalize. Since many reasons for vocalization in birds are directly linked to survival of the individual and species, the potential for detrimental population effects is a grave possibility for many avian species that may encounter androgen active chemicals in the environment. Many androgen active EDCs are persistent and ubiquitous in distribution, thereforechances for exposure to these chemicals in birds may be high.

To gain insight into the minds of uncooperative agents, economists and social psychologists have used the prisoner\u2019s dilemma task to examine factors leading to cooperation among competitors. Two types of factors have emerged in these studies: the relative rewards of defecting versus cooperating and breakdowns in trust, forgiveness and communication. The generalizability of economic and social psychological factors, however, relies on the assumption that agents\u2019 comparisons of gains and losses (whether for themselves, others, or both) preserves ratio information over arbitrary units, such as dollars and cents, and real rewards, such as food. This assumption is inconsistent with psychophysical studies on how the brain represents quantitative information, which suggests that mental magnitudes increase logarithmically with actual value. Thus, discrimination of two numerical magnitudes improves as the numerical distance between them increases and decreases as the magnitudes increase. Here we show an important consequence of this representational system for economic decision making: in the prisoner\u2019s dilemma game, purely nominal increases in the numerical magnitude of payoffs (such as, converting dollar values to cents or whole grapes into grape-parts) has a large effect on cooperative behaviour. Moreover, a logarithmic scaling of the ratio of rewards for cooperation versus defection predicted 97% of variability in observed cooperation, whereas the objective ratio predicted 0% of variability.

These proteins have a significant sequence similarity to only \u03b11-3/4 Fuc-Ts, and possess peptide motifs that are evolutionarily conserved among the known vertebrate \u03b11-3/4 Fuc-Ts.

Though a Fuc-T activity of the mouse proteins could not be detected, Fuc-TXI, but not Fuc-TX, was found to hydrolyze GDP-fucose.

[u'Historical temporal trends in groundwater levels from British Columbia, Canada', ['Sierra Rayne', 'Kaya Forest'], u'2012-01-28', u'A time trend study of groundwater monitoring well levels was conducted in British Columbia, Canada. Trend data was available for a total of 210 groundwater monitoring well stations throughout the province with end-of-month water levels over the period of record. Significant temporal trends in groundwater levels were found at 67 stations (40.4% of all stations amenable to statistical examination, and 31.9% of all available stations). Of these 67 stations, 10 had increasing groundwater level trends and the remaining 57 had declining groundwater level trends. Thus, 34.3% of stations with a sufficiently long time series for analysis displayed declining groundwater level trends, while 6.0% have increasing trends, and 59.6% of these stations appear to have no significant temporal variation in groundwater levels. Geographic distinctions in groundwater level time trends are difficult to make owing to the unbalanced distribution of monitoring sites throughout the province. Based on percentages of total stations with a sufficiently long monitoring record for statistical analysis, it appears that the semi-arid Thompson/Nicola and Okanagan zones of British Columbia are most likely to have declining groundwater levels. Overall, a substantial proportion of groundwater monitoring wells in British Columbia \u2013 which have been operated with varying record lengths dating from recent installations to sites with records back to the 1950s \u2013 are exhibiting declining levels.

The bacteria and their phages, being the most abundant constituents of the aquatic environment, represent an ideal model for studing carbon regulation in the aquatic system. The refractory dissolved organic carbon (DOC), a recently coined terminology from the microbe-driven conversion of bioavailable organic carbon into difficult-to-digest refractory DOC by microbial carbon pump (MCP), is suggested to have the potential to revolutionize our view of carbon sequestration. It is estimated that about 95% of organic carbon is in the form of refractory DOC, which is the largest pool of organic matter in the ocean. The refractory DOC is supposed to be the major factor in the global carbon cycle whose source is not yet well understood. A key element of the carbon cycle is the microbial conversion of dissolved organic carbon into inedible forms. The time studies of phage-host interaction under control conditions reveal their impact on the total carbon content of the source and their interconversion among organic, inorganic and other forms of carbon with respect to control source. The TOC- analysis statistics stipulate an increase in inorganic carbon content by 15-25 percent in the sample with phage as compared to the sample without phage. The results signify a 60-70 fold increase in inorganic carbon content in sample with phage, whereas, 50-55 fold in the case of sample without phages as compared with control. This increase in inorganic carbon content may be due to lysis of the host cell releasing its cellular constituents and utilization of carbon constituent for phage assembly and development. It also proves the role of phages in regulating the carbon flow in aquatic systems like oceans, where their concentration outnumbered other species.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/6770/version/1', [u'Ecology', u'Earth & Environment'], [u'National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI)']]

[u'The existence of species rests on a metastable equilibrium  between inbreeding and outbreeding', ['Etienne Joly'], u'2011-08-12', u'Background: Speciation corresponds to the progressive establishment of reproductive barriers between groups of individuals derived from an ancestral stock. Since Darwin did not believe that reproductive barriers could be selected for, he proposed that most events of speciation would occur through a process of separation and divergence, and this point of view is still shared by most evolutionary biologists today. Results: I do, however, contend that, if so much speciation occurs, it must result from a process of natural selection, whereby it is advantageous for individuals to reproduce preferentially within a group and reduce their breeding with the rest of the population, leading to a model whereby new species arise not by populations splitting into separate branches, but by small inbreeding groups \u201cbudding\u201d from an ancestral stock. This would be driven by several advantages of inbreeding, and mainly by advantageous recessive phenotypes, which could only be retained in the context of inbreeding. Reproductive barriers would thus not arise passively as a consequence of drift in isolated populations, but under the selective pressure of ancestral stocks. Most documented cases of speciation in natural populations appear to fit the model proposed, with more speciation occurring in populations with high inbreeding coefficients, many recessive characters identified as central to the phenomenon of speciation, with these recessive mutations expected to be surrounded by patterns of limited genomic diversity.Conclusions: Whilst adaptive evolution would correspond to gains of function that would, most of the time, be dominant, the phenomenon of speciation would thus be driven by mutations resulting in the advantageous loss of certain functions since recessive mutations very often correspond to the inactivation of a gene. A very important further advantage of inbreeding is that it reduces the accumulation of recessive mutations in genomes. A consequence of the model proposed is that the existence of species would correspond to a metastable equilibrium between inbreeding and outbreeding, with excessive inbreeding promoting speciation, and excessive outbreeding resulting in irreversible accumulation of recessive mutations that could ultimately only lead to the extinction.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/5003/version/4', [u'Ecology', u'Genetics & Genomics', u'Earth & Environment', u'Evolutionary Biology'], [u'IPBS, Toulouse']]
[u'Power-law behavior reveals phase transitions in landscape controls of fire regimes', ['Donald McKenzie', 'Maureen C.

Understanding the environmental controls on historical wildfires, and how they changed across spatial scales, is difficult because there are no surviving explicit records of either weather or vegetation (fuels). We show how power laws associated with fire-event time series arise in limited domains of parameters that represent critical transitions in the controls on landscape fire. We used stochastic simulations iteratively with Monte Carlo inference to replicate the spatio-temporal structure of historical fire-scar records in forested watersheds of varying topographic complexity. We find that the balance between endogenous and exogenous controls on fire spread shifts with topographic complexity, where in the most complex landscapes the endogenous controls dominate and the pattern exhibits criticality. Comparison to an self-organized criticality (SOC) model6,7 shows that the latter mimics historical fire only in a limited domain of criticality, and is not an adequate mechanism to explain landscape fire dynamics, which are shaped by both endogenous and exogenous controls.

Because formation of a massive secondary atmosphere on a planetary body would associate with a major differentiation of its sold body during accretion6\u20138, the presence of such an atmosphere on undifferentiated cold Titan poses a serious dilemma on our view of how planetary bodies develop atmospheres.

Additionally, we investigated the potential differences between the SP breeding and wintering distributions using only regional-scale physiognomic variables and the recorded occur- rences. To quantify the relationship between past renourishment projects and shorebird species we used a Monte Carlo procedure to sample from the posterior distribution of the binomial probabilities that a region is not a nesting or a wintering ground conditional on the occurrence of a beach replenishment intervention in the same and the previous year. The results indicate that it was 2.3, 3.1, and 0.8 times more likely that a region was not a wintering ground following a year with a renourishment intervention for the SP, PP and RK respectively. For the SP it was 2.5. times more likely that a region was not a breeding ground after a renourishment event. Through a maximum entropy principle model we observed small differences in the habitat use of the SP during the breeding and the wintering season. However the habitats where RK was observed appeared quite different. While ecological niche models at the macro-scale are useful for determining habitat suitability ranges, the characterization of the species\u2019 local niche is fundamentally important for adopting concrete multi-species management scenarios. Maintaining and creating optimal suitable habitats for SP characterized by sparse low vegetation in the foredunes areas, and uneven/low-slope beach surfaces, is the proposed conservation scenario to convert anthropic beach restorations and SP populations into a positive feedback without impacting other threatened shorebird species.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/5872/version/1', [u'Ecology', u'Earth & Environment', u'Evolutionary Biology'], [u'University of Florida', u'Florida State University ', u'USACE ERDC']]

[u'Projected Climate Change Impacts on Grape Growing in the Okanagan Valley, British Columbia, Canada', ['Sierra Rayne', 'Kaya Forest', 'Ken J. Friesen'], u'2011-02-27', u'A statistical analysis was conducted on long-term climate records in the Okanagan Valley wine grape growing region of British Columbia, Canada. No observable trends for average annual temperatures were found in the region. Analyses of monthly mean and extreme temperatures show wide spatial and temporal heterogeneity, indicating that future studies using downscaling of global climate models for this region will require resolutions on the order of several kilometers. Mean winter temperatures are increasing throughout the valley, and extreme minimum temperatures are also increasing during the winter at the central and northern sites which have historically presented the most risk of winter damage to grapevines. Only the most southern and northern sub-regions are expected to see significant changes in their heat unit accumulations during the growing season. Over the coming century, the southern end of the valley will likely move from Winkler heat unit region 1 to 2. All regions of the Okanagan will continue to have latitude-temperature indices among the lowest of the world\u2019s fine table wine producing regions over the coming century. Growing season and dormant season average temperatures are expected to change by only a modest amount by 2100. Current climate maturity groupings for ripening grape varieties will likely stay constant at cool (central and southern areas) and intermediate (south-central) for all sites except Osoyoos (south). The climate trendings at Osoyoos suggest it will transition from an intermediate to a warm grouping by about 2050. The early to mid-season ripening capacity of the region may improve due to climate changes, but there is a risk of the asymmetric late season increases in minimum daily temperatures lowering the daily temperature range at some sites, possibly leading to difficulties in maintaining a balanced between sugar and sensory profiles as wine grapes approach maturity. The projected warming at the southern end of the valley should favor improved and increased Merlot production, will require Chardonnay production to shift northwards, and will allow growing of warmer climate wine grape varieties currently inaccessible because of low winter temperatures and a lack of growing season heat units. Increasing winter temperatures throughout the region are expected to result in increased risk of pests such as Pierce\u2019s disease.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/3162/version/2', [u'Earth & Environment'], [u'University of Winnipeg', u'Okanagan College']]

Our understanding of the dynamics involved, and hence our ability to interpret past and predict future variability of the Greenland Ice Sheet, however, is severely impeded by the lack of measurements at the ice/ocean interface. To fill this gap, attempts to quantify the submarine melt rate and its variability have relied on a paradigm developed for tidewater glaciers terminating in fjords with shallow sills. In this case, the fjords\u2019 waters are mostly homogeneous and the heat transport to the terminus, and hence the melt rate, is controlled by a single overturning cell in which glacially modified water upwells at the ice edge, driving an inflow at depth and a fresh outflow at the surface1. Greenland\u2019s fjords, however, have deep sills which allow both cold, fresh Arctic and warm, salty Atlantic waters, circulating around Greenland, to reach the ice sheet margin3,6,7. Thus, Greenland\u2019s glaciers flow into strongly stratified fjords and the generic tidewater glacier paradigm is not applicable. Here, using new summer data collected at the margins of Helheim Glacier, East Greenland, we show that melting is driven by both Atlantic and Arctic waters and that the circulation at the ice edge is organized in multiple, overturning cells that arise from their different properties. Multiple cells with different characteristics are also observed in winter, when glacial run off is at a minimum and there is little surface outflow. These results indicate that stratification in the fjord waters has a profound impact on the melting dynamics and suggest that the shape and stability of Greenland\u2019s glaciers are strongly influenced by layering and variability in the Arctic and Atlantic waters.

However, a method which can directly capture and mineralize CO2 at a point source, under actual field conditions, has advantages and could help offset the cost associated with the conventional CCS technologies. The mineral carbonation (MC), a process of converting CO2 into stable minerals (mineralization), has been studied extensively to store CO2. However, most of the MC studies have been largely investigated at laboratory scale. Objectives of this research were to develop a pilot scale AMC (accelerated mineral carbonation) process and test the effects of flue gas moisture content on carbonation of fly ash particles. A pilot scale AMC process consisting of a moisture reducing drum (MRD), a heater/humidifier, and a fluidized-bed reactor (FBR) was developed and tested by reacting flue gas with fly ash particles at one of the largest coal-fired power plants (2120 MW) in the USA. The experiments were conducted over a period of 2 hr at ~ 300 SCFM flow-rates, at a controlled pressure (115.1 kPa), and under different flue gas moisture contents (2-16%). The flue gas CO2 and SO2 concentrations were monitored before and during the experiments by an industrial grade gas analyzer. Fly ash samples were collected from the reactor sample port from 0-120 minutes and analyzed for total inorganic carbon (C), sulfur (S), and mercury (Hg). From C, S, and Hg concentrations, %calcium carbonate (CaCO3), %sulfate (SO42-), and %mercury carbonate (HgCO3) were calculated, respectively. Results suggested significant mineralization of flue gas CO2, SO2, and Hg within 10-15 minutes of reaction. Among different moisture conditions, ~16% showed highest conversion of flue gas CO2 and SO2 to %CaCO3 and %SO42- in fly ash samples. For example, an increase of almost 4% in CaCO3 content of fly ash was observed. Overall, the AMC process is cost-effective with minimum carbon footprint and can be retrofitted to coal fired power plants (existing and/or new) as a post-combustion unit to minimize flue gas CO2, SO2, and Hg emissions into the atmosphere. Used in conjunction with capture and geologic sequestration, the AMC process has the potential to reduce overall cost associated with CO2 separation/compression/transportation/pore space/brine water treatment. It could also help protect sensitive amines and carbon filters used in flue gas CO2 capture and separation process and extend their life.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/5404/version/1', [u'Earth & Environment'], [u'University of Wyoming', u'Earthview Environmental', u'Brigham Young University', u'Jim Bridger Power Plant']]
[u'Photoprotection in Southern Ocean phytoplankton: missing key to low primary productivity', ['Gary Griffith', 'Ross Vennell'], u'2010-12-09', u'The Southern Ocean is considered a zone of high nutrients and low chlorophyll (HNLC). Despite the year round availability of nutrients, phytoplankton biomass remains low. Key modes of control are now thought to be light, grazing, iron and supply of silicic acid1. Physiological photoprotective mechanisms used by phytoplankton to regulate photosynthesis versus rapid light fluctuations have not been considered important. In diatoms and haptophytes, which are the major component of phytoplankton biodiversity in the Southern Ocean, the one step de-epoxidation of diadinoxanthin (Dd) into diatoxanthin (Dt) of the Dd-cycle constitutes the main photoprotective mechanism2,3. Here we show that Southern Ocean diatoms and haptophytes have higher concentrations of cellular Dd-cycle pigments than other oceanic regions. The Dd-cycle is activated under low irradiance conditions and the pool of photoprotective pigments increases under intermittent light conditions. The high cellular concentration of Dd-cycle pigments and our observations of an increase of the pool size of Dd-cycle pigments towards the surface implies that the Dd-cycle pigments bind to light harvesting proteins other than with fucoxanthin and chlorophyll c. Within photosystem II, enrichment of Dd and the physiological acclimation to light changes constrains photosynthetic activity, efficiency and potentially growth rates3-7. These results raise important questions about the role of photoprotective mechanisms in limiting Southern Ocean primary productivity and how these mechanisms will respond to predicted climate change impacts8.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/5377/version/1', [u'Ecology', u'Earth & Environment'], [u'University of Otago, Marine Science']]

Southwestern Alberta and the southwestern Northwest Territories contain small clusters of stations with increasing water yield trends; clusters of decreasing water yield trends are primarily located in central and southern Alberta.

The methods of refuge biogeography helped shape early conservation priorities in Amazonia, although actual plans did not directly depend on the conceptual strengths or weaknesses of refugia biogeography. These approaches viewed people mostly as threats, though not always explicitly. Based on his work on primate distribution Marcio Ayres formulated a synthetic speciation theory, the river-refuge hypothesis. The river-refuge model successfully resolved some of the historical and technical challenges of the earlier hypotheses. His work in varzea conservation, informed by this conceptual brealthrough, recognized that the maintenance of processes is at least as important as species numbers in prioritizing action.

As hot deserts are extreme habitats characterized by the availability of solar energy with a nearly complete absence of organic life and water, space technology achievements in designing closed ecological systems may be applicable to the design of sustainable settlements in the deserts. This review discusses the key space technology findings for closed biogenerative life support systems (CBLSS), which can simultaneously produce food, water, nutrients, fertilizers, process wastes, and revitalize air, that can be applied to hot deserts. Among them are the closed cycle of water and the acceleration of the cycling times of carbon, biogenic compounds, and nutrients by adjusting the levels of light intensity, temperature, carbon dioxide, and air velocity over plant canopies. Enhanced growth of algae and duckweed at higher levels of carbon dioxide and light intensity can be important to provide complete water recycling and augment biomass production. The production of fertilizers and nutrients can be enhanced by applying the subsurface flow wetland technology and hyper-thermophilic aerobic bacteria for treating liquid and solid wastes. The mathematical models, optimization techniques, and non-invasive measuring techniques developed for CBLSS make it possible to monitor and optimize the performance of such closed ecological systems. The results of long-duration experiments performed in BIOS-3, Biosphere 2, Laboratory Biosphere, and other ground-based closed test facilities suggest that closed water cycle can be achieved in hot-desert bioregenerative systems using the pathways of evapotranspiration, condensation, and biological wastewater treatment technologies.

Although, both countries seem to be two of the most prone of all Latin American and Caribbean countries to natural hazard events, historically, Haiti tends to be more vulnerable to natural forces. The purpose of this article is to understand to what extent geohazards shape demographic changes. Research findings of this study show that neither atmospheric nor seismic hazards that directly hit the territory of Haiti have significant impacts on population densities and growth rates. Quantitative evidence is provided, that between 1850 to 2009 urbanization processes have exposed more people to natural forces.

It is shown that the diamonds could be divided into two main groups, differing in the type of dominant Fe-bearing inclusions. In the first group Fe is mostly trivalent and is present in octahedral coordination; diamonds from the second group contain a mixture of Fe2+ and Fe3+, most likely with Fe2+ in dodecahedral coordination. A few other diamonds contain iron in a more reduced state: the presence of metallic Fe and Fe3O4 is inferred from XAS measurements. Spatially resolved XANES and M\xf6ssbauer measurements on polished diamond plates show that in some cases the Fe valence state may change considerably between the core and rim, whereas in other cases Fe speciation and valence remain constant. It is shown that Fe valence does not correlate with water and/or carbonate content or ratio, suggesting that iron is a minor element in the growth medium of fibrous diamonds and plays a passive role.

[u'Modelling predicts that heat stress and not drought will limit wheat yield in Europe', ['Mikhail A. Semenov', 'Peter R. Shewry'], u'2010-04-06', u'Global warming is characterised by shifts in weather patterns and increases in extreme weather events. New crop cultivars with specific physiological traits will therefore be required if climate change is not to result in losses of yield and food shortages. However, the intrinsic uncertainty of climate change predictions poses a challenge to plant breeders and crop scientists who have limited time and resources and must select the most appropriate traits for improvement. Modelling is, therefore, a powerful tool to identify future threats to crop production and hence targets for improvement. Wheat is the most important crop in temperate zones, including Europe, and is the staple food crop for many millions of humans and their livestock. However, its production is highly sensitive to environmental conditions, with increased temperature and incidence of drought associated with global warming posing potential threats to yield in Europe. We have therefore predicted the future impacts of these environmental changes on wheat yields using a wheat simulation model combined with climate scenarios based on fifteen global climate models from the IPCC AR4 multi-model ensemble. Despite the lower summer precipitation predicted for Europe, the impact of drought on wheat yields is likely to be smaller than at present, because the warmer conditions will result in earlier maturation before drought becomes severe later in the summer. By contrast, the probability of heat stress around flowering is predicted to increase significantly which is likely to result in considerable yield losses for heat sensitive wheat cultivars commonly grown in north Europe. Breeding strategies should therefore focus on the development of wheat varieties which are tolerant to high temperature around flowering, rather than on developing varieties resistant to drought which may be required for other parts of the world.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/4335/version/1', [u'Earth & Environment', u'Plant Biology'], [u'Rothamsted Research, Centre for Mathematical and Computational Biology', u'Rothamsted Research, Centre for Crop Genetic Improvement']]

In contrast to this, almost all L3 derived  hunter gatherers have a more belligerent culture that includes ritualized fights such as wrestling, stick fights or headhunting expeditions. This appears to be independent of their environment, because ritualized fights occur in all climates, from the tropics to the arctic. There is also a correlation between mitochondrial haplotypes and warfare propensity or the use of murder and suicide to resolve conflicts. This, in the light of the \u201crecent out of Africa\u201d hypothesis\u201d6,7, suggests that the tribe that left Africa 80.000 years ago performed ritualized fights.

Exploitation, coupled with region wide declines of coral environments has resulted in local and regional vertebrate extinctions. The impact of those extinctions on reef communities, however, remains largely unexplored. Here we show, using a highly resolved model coral reef-seagrass food web, that at least 40 of 188 expected vertebrate species are absent from Jamaican coral reefs. Twenty one of the absent species are of high trophic level and are exploited by humans. The remainder of the absent species are unexploited, and comprises a significantly high proportion of specialized reef foragers. Many of those species are also more trophically specialized than their closest trophic competitors. We conclude that the absence of unexploited species from Jamaica is caused by the overexploitation of high trophic level species, and consequent trophic cascades and secondary extinction among their prey in an increasingly degraded reef environment.

In 2005, agriculture accounted for an estimated emission of 5.1 to 6.1 GtCO2-eq/yr (10-12% of total global anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs))1. However, measures to mitigate GHGs emission from agricultural soils are limited to improved cropland practices such as crop rotation, nutrient management, tillage/residue management, agroforestry, and return to natural vegetation2. These practices are not only far from substantially reducing GHGs emissions from soils or permanentlystabilizing soil organic matter1-4, but are also predicted to hardly match more than amaximum of 25% of the GHGs reductions required by the Kyoto Protocol within 20505.Despite the knowledge that GHGs release from soil largely derives from biochemicaltransformations of plant litter and soil organic matter (SOM)6-8, no new and much wished biotechnological measures are adopted so far to augment mitigation1.

Substantial uncertainty remains, however, because of the expectation that feedbacks through the nitrogen (N) cycle will reduce the CO2 stimulation of NPP5,6; these feedbacks were not included in the AR4 models and heretofore have not been confirmed by experiments in forests7. Here, we provide new evidence from a FACE experiment in a deciduous Liquidambar styraciflua (sweetgum) forest stand in Tennessee, USA, that N limitation has significantly reduced the stimulation of NPP by elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration (eCO2). Isotopic evidence and N budget analysis support the premise that N availability in this forest ecosystem has been declining over time, and declining faster in eCO2. Model analyses and evidence from leaf- and stand-level observations provide mechanistic evidence that declining N availability constrained the tree response to eCO2.

The temperature of Lake Victoria rose by 0.9\xb0C between 1960 and 1990 raising fears that thermal stability would increase resulting in more extensive and severe anoxia in the deeper waters5. This is of concern because of the eutrophication of the lake, which began in the 1960s,6,7 and led to dense blooms of sometimes toxic cyanobacteria, increased deoxygenation of the bottom waters, and fish kills in some parts of the lake8,9,10. Here we show that thermal gradients in the water column have weakened over the last decade and that deoxygenation of deeper waters is less pronounced than expected. Since 1927 the temperature of the deeper waters has risen by 1.3\xb0C compared to only 1.0\xb0C in the surface layers, thereby decreasing thermal and density differentials in the water column. This contradicts the view that eutrophication would increase deoxygenation of the water column perhaps to the point where fish production could not be sustained11.

[u'Jellyfish as vectors of bacterial disease for farmed fish.', ['Hugh W. Ferguson', 'Christian M. J. Delannoy', 'James Nicolson', 'David Sutherland', 'Margaret Crumlish', 'Steven Hay'], u'2009-08-17', u'Gill diseases are common, especially in intensively reared fish; they result in respiratory distress, as well as impaired osmoregulation and excretion (1). Bacteria and parasites are common causes of gill disease, as is poor water quality, including planktonic blooms. Swarms or blooms of jellyfish are increasingly and especially problematical (2), and can result in high mortality of farmed fish. Small species of jellyfish such as Philalella quadrata (13 mm diameter) are capable of passing through the mesh of sea-cages and of being sucked into the mouth of fish during respiration. Here we show that the initial damage to gills of farmed Atlantic salmon, likely produced by nematocyst-derived toxins from the jellyfish, was compounded by secondary bacterial infection with Tenacibaculum maritimum. We also demonstrate that these filamentous bacteria were present on the mouth of the jellyfish and that their DNA sequences were almost identical to those of bacteria present on the salmon gills. This suggests that the bacterial lesions were not the result of an opportunistic infection of damaged tissue as previously thought. Instead, P. quadrata is probably acting as a vector for this particular bacterial pathogen, and it is the first time that evidence to support such a link has been presented. We could find no prior literature describing the presence of bacteria associated with jellyfish, other than some studies about their decay. We do not know if all jellyfish of this and other species carry similar bacteria in a symbiotic relationship, nor do we know their source, the role that they play under other circumstances, or indeed whether the jellyfish were themselves diseased. The high proteolytic capabilities of T. maritimum mean that partially digested gill tissues were readily available to the jellyfish, which rely heavily on intracellular digestion for their nutrition.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/3631/version/1', [u'Microbiology', u'Earth & Environment'], [u'University of Stirling, Institute of Aquaculture', u'Westside Veterinary Surgery, Bixter, Shetland, Scotland', u'Marine Scotland Marine Laboratory, Aberdeen, Scotland']]
[u'Proposing a life cycle land use impact calculation methodology', ['Wouter M. J.

To solve this problem we start from concepts and models describing how ecosystems function and sustain, in order to understand how land use affects them. Earlier our research group presented a methodology based on the ecosystem exergy concept. This concept as based on the hypothesis that ecosystems develop towards more effective degradation of exergy fluxes passing through the system and is derived from two axioms: the principles of (i) maximum exergy storage and the (ii) maximum exergy dissipation. This concept aiming at the area of protection natural environment is different from conventional exergy analysis in LCA focusing on natural resources. To prevent confusion, the ecosystem exergy concept is further referred to as the MAximum Storage and Dissipation concept (MASD concept). In this paper we present how this concept identifies end-point impacts, mid-point impacts and mid-point indicators. The identified end-point impacts to assess are Ecosystem Structural Quality (ESQ) and Ecosystem Functional Quality (EFQ). In order to quantify these end-point impacts a dynamic multi-indicator set is proposed for quantifying the mid-point impacts on soil fertility, biodiversity and biomass production (quantifying the ESQ) and soil structure, vegetation structure and on-site water balance (quantifying the EFQ). Further we present an impact calculation method suitable for different environmental assessment tools and demonstrate the incorporation of the methodology in LCA.Suggested citation:Achten WMJ, Mathijs E, Muys B 2009.

Suresh Rao', 'Nathaniel Morse', 'Robert Stewart'], u'2009-07-30', u'Nitrogen provides a fundamental building block for life. However, some nitrogen species (e.g., NO3) cause water quality degradation and contribute to climatic warming as a greenhouse gas (e.g., N2O).  Denitrification is a central process in the nitrogen cycle, transforming water-soluble nitrogen to gaseous nitrogen, thereby removing nitrogen from the system. The factors controlling denitrification are known, yet the general quantitative comparison of controls on denitrification remains a rich area of study. Understanding the relative importance of various controls over denitrification is critical given its biological importance, role in the Earth system, and the current perturbation of the global nitrogen cycle by human activity. We demonstrate that the \u2018effective\u2019 denitrification rate constant (first-order constant; ke [T-1]) and advective water transport (mean residence time; \u03c4 [T]) scale inversely across diverse systems, ranging from hillslopes and groundwater to large lakes and estuaries. As a result, we observe a relatively constant nitrogen removal across nine orders of magnitude in transport time scales. A central question remains as to why ke scales approximately linearly with  \u03c4. We suggest that the variability of ke arises from hydrologic masking of an intrinsic denitrification rate constant (kden). A two-compartment model shows how ke varies with the amount of advective water, and thus \u03c4, explaining how denitrification losses in the reactive zone of a system are controlled by mass transfer to that reactive zone. Our finding highlights mean residence time in the advective zone as a primary control on effective rates of denitrification, while other factors (e.g., nitrate and organic carbon concentrations) provide secondary controls.

[u'The importance of decadal-scale climate variability to wind-driven modulation of hypoxia in Chesapeake Bay', ['Malcolm E. Scully'], u'2009-06-02', u'Millions of dollars are spent annually to reduce nutrient loading to Chesapeake Bay, with a fundamental goal of reducing the extent and severity of low dissolved oxygen (hypoxia) during the summertime months1. Yet despite recent reductions in nutrient loading, large volumes of the Bay continue to be impacted by hypoxia and anoxia during the summer months2-3. One obstacle to assessing efforts to improve water quality in the Bay and other estuarine systems is a complete understanding of the physical processes that modulate dissolved oxygen and the long-term variability of these processes. Here I analyze a 58-year data set of estimated hypoxic volume in the Bay2 and demonstrate the importance that wind direction plays in controlling the extent and severity of summertime hypoxia. This analysis indicates that wind direction explains a greater percentage of the observed inter-annual variation in hypoxic volume than estimates of nutrient loading. The implication is that physical processes play a dominant role in modulating hypoxia and that much of the increased hypoxia observed since the early 1980s can be attributed to changes in wind forcing that are the result of decadal-scale climate variability. These findings emphasize the importance of understanding the physical processes that modulate dissolved oxygen in coastal and estuarine systems and highlight the potential impact that climate change may have on water quality in Chesapeake Bay and other estuarine systems.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/3308/version/1', [u'Earth & Environment'], [u'Old Dominion University, Center for Coastal Physical Oceanography']]

Assembly of the structural elements C, N, S, P, and O is based on valency and ionic potential. The selection of monovalent elements (bar H+) and divalent elements (bar O2-) involves a trade-off between low atomic mass and low ionic potential.

High tree species diversity and soil heterogeneity are important factors driving the variability of foliar chemistry in the tropics; however, this variability could be reduced at the level of the functional characteristics of the species present at a site. In this study it is hypothesized that foliar N:P ratios would be more constrained when the species are grouped according to functional characteristics, and would reveal patterns of nutrient limitation. The study was conducted in a tropical forest landscape of the Porce region in Colombia, which consists of patches of primary and secondary forests of different ages. The functional groupings revealed consistent patterns of conservative N cycling in species present at young secondary sites, as well as conservative P cycling of the species present later in succession and in primary forests. Although the observed data have limitations in terms of capturing the overall variability for each functional group, the classification used here provided support for the proposed hypotheses.

Ecological networks, composed of habitat patches connected by species dispersal, are intrinsically spatial and show promise as a tool for conservation planning; but while habitat-loss effects on ecological networks have been simulated, such effects have not been directly measured in ecological networks varying over time. In this study, I used satellite remote sensing to study ecological networks composed of wetland habitat in the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) of North America. I find power-law scaling of important topological properties as a function of dispersal ability and as wetland density varies with climate. Prairie wetland networks are \u2018meso-worlds\u2019 with mean topological distance increasing faster with network size than small-world networks, but slower than regular lattices. While similar dynamics have been shown in random spatial networks, these results emphasize the importance of processes determining locations of nodes in a spatial network, with possible implications in other areas like wireless communication networks or disease transmission networks. Wetland networks establish a climate envelope for landscape connectivity in the PPR, and I show that wetland-dependent species face a \u2018crisis of connectivity\u2019 with climate change.

Malaria is an infectious disease that is being transferred by the female mosquito of the species Anopheles. The life cycle of the malaria parasite develops in the anopheline and in the human body. These parasites require suitable environmental parameters in order to complete their development cycles within the mosquito. These parameters are temperature, humidity, vegetation and water. A temperature range of 25\xb0C to 35\xb0C and relative humidity range of 50 to 80 percent is suitable for developing malaria outbreaks. As the fly-range of the mosquito is limited to 2 to 4 kilometers and since water pools are necessary for breeding, then the vector abundance is significantly higher around water bodies. Vegetation cover has an indirect role on malaria vector abundance. The vegetated areas help moisture availability in the air and on the soil. To locate the high potential region for malaria outbreaks, one could extract the map of abovementioned parameters via remote sensing images.

Manage'], u'2008-09-22', u'Human activities threat seashore communities in many areas of the world and their impacts on coastal ecosystem are a matter of increasing concern. Present study describes the anthropogenic disturbances on the rocky shore community structure by comparing the benthic communities of disturbed and non-disturbed areas in Sri Lanka where rocky shores remain virtually untouched so far by experimental studies. Impacts of human disturbances; trampling, handling and exploitation on the community structure of rocky macro benthic assemblages were tested in high-, mid- and low-intertidal area by stratified sampling method at Rumassala marine sanctuary and adjacent two localities at either side of the marine sanctuary, Galle and Unawatuna. Univariate measures, log series model and multivariate techniques were used to discriminate the communities with respect to the disturbances. Proximity of study localities and indistinguishable physicochemical parameters of sea surface water (temperature, Salinity, conductivity, dissolved oxygen and pH) indicated that overall environment of the study area was relatively uniform and changes in community structure was due to human disturbances. Human disturbances documented as visitor censuses by transect walk method lead to categorize the Rumassala as non-disturbed, Unawatuna as disturbed with Galle being of moderately disturbance. Community abundance showed a decreasing trend along with increasing disturbances, albeit community biomass, due to opportunistic algae species, increased in parallel to disturbances. Computed Index of disturbance revealed that macrofauna was very sensitive to the disturbances and increased disturbances reduced their competitive pressure on macroalgae, leading to outstanding macroalgal growth. Macroalgal domination in disturbed communities contributed to lessen the heterotrophic dominance in Galle and Unawatuna. 96 macrobenthic taxa were encountered from the study and Species richness, Shannon and Fisher\u2019s diversity index showed decreasing trend with increasing disturbances. Moreover, initial rising slope of species accumulation curves for three communities indicated that community evenness was low in disturbed communities. The community compositions from dominant conservative species to fast growing opportunistic species were well described by the log series model, showing left skewed distribution. The SIMPER analysis further confirmed that most biomass dominant species in stress status were the opportunistic species such as Valoniopsis pachynema, Gracilaria cassa and Padina boerggesenii. Providing strong support to the results highlighted from univariate measures and log series model, multivariate cluster analysis and nMDS plots completely separated three communities at ordinal scale. This separation was further confirmed by one-way ANOSIM test with significantly higher (2.9%) similarity of study sites within each community. Present study indicated that, allowing less time for recovery, human activities created press-type disturbance on macro-benthic assemblages, and subsequent changes in community structure could be attributed to less suitable substrata. Study proposed that ecological stress is the best measured by multiple methods, and results from different approaches provide the robustness necessary to judge the reliability of the conclusion.

[u'Variability and community organization in moderately exposed tropical rocky shore algal communities as influenced by different consumer groups', ['Edison Macusi'], u'2008-09-08', u'Tropical rocky shores have been described as diverse and having a complex variety of consumers. This wide array of consumers has been studied to shed light on the different roles of consumers, particularly grazers on rocky shores and how they affect the relative abundance and distribution of sessile algal prey. One of the aims of ecology is to clarify factors that regulate and structure the abundance, growth and relationship of predators and preys in each habitat. Grazing is known as one of the most important determinants of growth and distribution of rocky shore communities. In this study a comparison between the different effects of fishes, crabs and molluscan herbivores on the relative abundances of microalgae and macroalgae from micro (hundreds of microns) to medium (tens of meters to kilometers) scales of spatial variability was conducted. At the start of the experiment several hypotheses were forwarded: 1) that herbivores will reduce the density of microalgae and macroalgal cover causing a barren appearance and ultimately reducing algal diversity where grazing intensity is highest across treatments, sites and shores; 2) and where grazing pressure is low, algal cover and diversity will be high; 3) and that fishes and crabs contribute significantly to maintaining a high grazing pressure in the area and that fishes control the algal assemblage in benign environments. These were evaluated by exclusion experiments and quadrat counts to determine the effects of grazers on different functional groups of algae. Microalgal density was assessed indirectly by measuring chlorophyll a from rock chips taken from the treatment plots. Microspatial variability of different sites was assessed by scoring digital micrographs of rock chips also taken from treatment plots.  Algal cover of treatment plots was assessed by using digital photos taken during forthnightly visits in all sites. The univariate and  multivariate results show significant differences across treatments, sites and shores and even significant temporal differences. Microalgal abundance and erect algal cover in fenced plots were significantly different compared to the other treatments. Grazer removal effectively caused a completely different algal assemblage to develop through time in cage and fenced treatments while maintaining a mostly barren cover in most open and control set-ups. Species which are not typically present in shores have grown inside cage and fenced treatments during the period of manipulation. Molluscan herbivores are the most effective grazers in these shores and control the relative distribution of algae by restricting the recruitment success of algal sporelings particularly erect macroalgae. Herbivorous fishes and crabs do not directly influence algal sporelings since the early stages of algae are too small for them to handle. But both consumers complement the removal of turf forming algae. The observed over all grazing effects show that molluscs have greater impact than fishes and crabs combined; the effect of either fishes or crabs are equal. Hence, the impact of crabs and fishes on these shores are minimal, mainly affecting turf forming algae. Moreover, the observed spatial variability in algal assemblage from micro to medium scales is mainly driven by high grazing intensity. Thus, grazing acts as a highly effective top down control mechanism in these shores during the cool winter season.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/2267/version/1', [u'Ecology', u'Earth & Environment'], [u'University of Bremen']]

[u'Testing a new intervention to enhance road safety', ['Rainer Spiegel', 'Roger Kalla', 'Frank Spiegel', 'Michael Strupp'], u'2008-08-25', u'By 2020, it is estimated that road accidents will have moved from ninth to third in the worldwide ranking of burden of disease, as assessed in the disability adjusted life years (DALY)1,2. Therefore, it is vital to find effective methods to enhance road safety. Speed limits and traffic calming have the potential to reduce injuries due to road accidents3,4. Many drivers, however, do not adhere to speed limits1-7. Several studies have shown that adherence to speed limits can be explained by the theory of planned behaviour 5-7 and that it is possible to focus on drivers\u2019 intentions via self-report questionnaires. It is often difficult, however, to reach the majority of drivers on accident-prone locations with self-report questionnaires. This paper demonstrates an intervention that can be interpreted in the light of two of the theory\u2019s key variables8. It also has the potential to reach a large number of drivers on such locations. It is a speed-displaying device mounted next to the road (especially in villages). It tells drivers their actual speed (which is publicly visible). The measurement takes place continuously, giving the driver the chance to adjust speed and see the new speed shortly thereafter. The results show that the feedback about the current speed is associated with a significant speed reduction relative to a Control condition.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/2231/version/1', [u'Neuroscience', u'Earth & Environment'], [u'Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Department of Neurology', u'Technische Universitaet Muenchen, Fakultaet fuer Wirtschaftswissenschaften']]

[u'Threshold Decline in Mesoamerican Coral Growth and Resiliency', ['Jessica Carilli', 'Richard Norris'], u'2008-07-23', u'Caribbean coral reefs have been massively altered in recent decades due to human impacts, resulting in a dramatic reduction of live coral cover but quantitative data before the 1970s have not been available to assess how these changes came about1,2,3. We produced master chronologies of growth rates in massive Montastrea faveolata corals from the Mesoamerican reef tract that provide a method for extending records of coral health further back into the past. Our records reveal a unique reduction in growth rate associated with the 1998 coral bleaching event that has no parallel in the past 75 to 150 years. Of 92 cores collected from live coral heads in 2006-2007, 94% have severely reduced growth rates and 14% exhibit partial mortality scars in 1998-1999 whereas only 3 stress bands are found in single cores prior to 1998, and none of these cores exhibited earlier partial mortality. Some corals returned to pre-1998 extension rates by 2001, although corals in areas affected by sediment-laden runoff or high human population density still had not fully recovered by the time of sample collection eight years later. Previous episodic stresses like hurricane strikes and a warming event in 1983 more severe than 1998 had little to no effect on M. faveolata growth rates. The 1998 event apparently surpassed a threshold in coral tolerance precipitating a catastrophic shutdown in growth that had lasting effects throughout the Mesoamerican reef system but was particularly prolonged in areas exposed to other stressors. These findings suggest that projected increases in global temperatures over the next century are likely to result in drastic reductions in growth rather than a gradual decline in coral health, but that corals with fewer local stresses will be better able to survive bleaching events, underscoring the need for local conservation measures.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/2115/version/1', [u'Earth & Environment'], [u'University of California San Diego, Scripps Institution of Oceanography', u'UCSD, Scripps Institution of Oceanography']]

Slightly younger (374 Ma) material from South Mountain, New York, conspecific with A. fimbriunguis, includes spigots and other evidence which elucidate the evolution of early Araneae and the origin of spider silk. No known Attercopus spigots, including the original specimen2, occur on true spinnerets but are arranged along the edges of plates. Spinnerets originated from biramous appendages of opisthosomal somites 4 and 5; while present in Limulus, no other arachnids have opisthosomal appendage homologues on these segments. The spigot arrangement in Attercopus shows a primitive state prior to the re-expression of the dormant genetic mechanism which gave rise to spinnerets in later spiders.

In this study we analyzed the set of behaviors that emerge after introducing population and community processes into an ecosystem carbon model. We used STANDCARB, a hybrid model that incorporates population, community, and ecosystem processes to predict carbon dynamics over time. Our simulations showed that at the population level, colonization and mortality rates can limit the maximum biomass achieved during a successional sequence. Specifically, colonization rates control temporal lags in the initiation of carbon accumulation, and mortality rates can have important effects on annual variation in live biomass. At the community level, differences in species traits and changes in species composition over time introduced significant changes in carbon dynamics. Species with different set of parameters, such as growth and mortality rates, introduce patterns of carbon accumulation that could not be reproduced using a single species with the average of parameters of multiple species or by simulating the most abundant species (strategies commonly employed in terrestrial biogeochemical models). We conclude that omitting population and community processes from biogeochemical models introduces an important source of uncertainty that can impose important limitations for predictions of future carbon balances.

Temperature-enhanced activity appeared to be supported by cellular ATP synthesis (increased cytochrome c oxidase and succinic dehydrogenase activities) and hydrolysis (increased ATPases activities), indicating high rate of intermediary metabolism, the substrates for which may come from the stored glycogen and fat in addition to ingested food. Temperature-enhanced activity was associated with loss of body mass and decrease in body size, both of which may result from hyperactivity (causing lack of replenishment of consumed stored glycogen and fat) and loss of body water (due to hyperosmolarity of water because of evaporation). Hyperthermia-caused hypoxia was associated with increase in hemoglobin (Hb) synthesis (a typical daphnid response to hypoxia). These responses to hyperthermic stress started showing up after one month of acclimation at 27 o-29 o C and after 6 months at lower temperature ranges (18 o-20 o C) indicating the possibility of initiation of similar responses in field populations at current expected rise in global temperature due to climate change. Since the thermal stress will continue for generations, the effects observed with D. magna may start showing up in other small aquatic poikilotherms; indicating the speeding up of their life processes and of their gametes, embryos, larvae, and young adults.

[u'Long term trend of chemical oxygen demand in Saroma-ko Lagoon, Japan; possible effects of climatic warming', ['Akihiro Shiomoto'], u'2008-05-05', u'A trend of shortening duration of ice coverage has been reported in many rivers, ponds and lakes around the world due to climatic warming. The shortening will have much influence on organic production due to the greater supply of light intensity and hence on water quality. Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), a useful measure of water quality, has been monitored over the past thirty years in Saroma-ko Lagoon, a boreal lake in Japan characterized by wintertime ice coverage. Here the data set of water quality in the lagoon is analyzed to reveal long-term trends in COD and the influence of climatic warming on such trends. There has been a significant increasing trend, caused primarily by an abrupt increase in the early 1990s. However, the increase could not be explained by the increased load of organic matter on the lagoon from the river basin and organic production in the lagoon. On the other hand, periods of freezing of the entire surface have tended to be shorter with inevitable thinning of ice over the past forty years, probably due to climatic warming. Ice and planktonic algae are exposed to the low light intensity in situ, which is not optimum for the algal production of organic matter. The shortening and thinning should thus bring an improvement in ambient light conditions for algae, resulting in an increase of organic matter in winter. Most of the organic matter possibly remains even after spring because of the low water temperature. It is highly possible that climatic warming promotes deterioration in water quality in ice-covered lakes.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/1857/version/1', [u'Earth & Environment'], [u'Tokyo University of Agriculture, Faculty of Bio-Industry']]

Our results indicated that for the range of annual total allowable catches (TAC) considered and set for Canada\u2019s commercial harp seal hunt (250,000 \u2013 350,000), there were plausible circumstances under which the government\u2019s management procedures failed to meet their own conservation objectives.

For some scenarios the current management strategy, although not fully specified, is likely to maintain a high TAC despite a declining population.  In particular, once a high TAC has been set, the assessments are unlikely to provide the necessary evidence that the TAC should be reduced until the population is at a low level.

The global demand for corn will exceed that for wheat and rice by 2020, making it the world\u2019s most important crop. Light-driven photosynthesis supports plant biomass production, but plants have also evolved safety valve mechanisms that attenuate the absorption of potentially lethal levels of excess light. The array of survival responses that enables leaves to evade photoinhibition is complex and involves chloroplast and leaf movement as well as the molecular rearrangements that facilitate thermal energy dissipation. Here we report a novel morphological mechanism that allows C4 monocotyledonous leaves to regulate photosynthesis independently on each surface with respect to incident light allowing better adaptation to water deficits and light stress. We show that under abaxial illumination as occurs when monocotyledonous leaves curl in response to water stress the stomata close and photosynthetic metabolism shuts down on the adaxial surface of C4 leaves but these parameters increase in function to the abaxial surface.

Clathrate hydrates and ice VII are also stable at PT conditions of cold slabs and represent other potential phases for water transport into the deep mantle. Some cold slabs are expected to deflect while crossing the 410 km and stagnate in transition zone being unable to penetrate through 660 km discontinuity. In this way slabs can move a long way beneath continents after long-lived subduction. With time, the stagnant slabs are heated to the temperature of the ambient transition zone and release free H2O-bearing fluid. Combining with transition zone water filter model this may cause voluminous melting of overlying upper mantle rocks. If such process operates in nature, magmas geochemically similar to island-arc magmas are expected to appear in places relatively remote from active arcs at the time of their emplacement. Dolerites of the south-eastern margin of the Siberian flood basalt province, located about 700 km from suggested trench, were probably associated with fast subduction of the Mongolia-Okhotsk slab and originated by dehydration of the stagnant slab in the transition zone.

[u'French birds lag behind climate warming', ['Vincent Devictor', 'Romain Julliard', 'Denis Couvet', 'Frederic Jiguet'], u'2007-10-29', u'Biodiversity responses to climate warming have been documented through the study of changes in distributions, abundances or phenologies of individual species or in more integrated measures such as species community richness and composition. However, whether these observed population and community changes are occurring fast enough to cope with new climatic conditions remain uncertain and hardly quantifiable. Here, using spatial and temporal trends from the French breeding bird survey, we show that although bird assemblages are strongly responding to climate warming, this response is slower than expected for catching up with the current temperature increase. During the last two decades, French birds have only achieved 54% of the response required to follow temperature increase, and have accumulated, in 18 years, a 97 km delay in their northward shift. We thus developed a framework to measure both the observed and predicted response of species assemblage to climate change, an approach which is flexible enough to be applicable to any taxa with large-scale survey data, using either abundance or distribution data. For example, it can be further used to test if different delays are found across groups or if, for a given group, the delay depends on the land-use contexts.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/1275/version/1', [u'Earth & Environment'], [u'MNHN, Ecology', u"Centre de Recherches sur la Biologie des Populations d'Oiseaux, Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle", u"Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle, CRBPO, UMR5173 Conservation des Esp&#x00E8;ces, Restauration et Suivi des Populations & European Bird Census Council"]]

Current remote sensing methodologies for estimating gross primary productivity are not satisfactory because they rely too heavily on (i) the availability of climatic data, (ii) the definition of land-use cover, and (iii) the assumptions of the effects of these two factors on the radiation-use efficiency of vegetation (RUE). A new methodology is urgently needed that will actually assess RUE and overcome the problems associated with the capture of fluctuations in carbon absorption in space and over time. Remote sensing techniques such as the widely used reflectance vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI, EVI) allow green plant biomass and therefore plant photosynthetic capacity to be assessed. Nevertheless, detecting how much of this capacity is actually realized is a much more challenging goal. The Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) derived from freely available satellite information (MODIS sensor) presented an exponential relationship with the RUE. Thus, we show that it is possible to estimate RUE in real time and therefore actual carbon uptake at ecosystem, regional, and biosphere levels using the PRI. This conceptual and technological advancement avoids the need to rely on either the sometimes unreliable maximum RUE for each ecosystem, hard-to-obtain climate data, or on imprecise land-use/land-cover data.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/977/version/2', [u'Earth & Environment'], [u'CREAF - Univ.

Although uraninite is regarded as a rare accessory mineral, it is relatively abundant in leucogranitic rocks such as those found in the Himalayan orogen.  We apply the U-Th-total Pb electron microprobe chemical dating method to a uraninite crystal from a ca. 18.3 Ma dike of the Mugu granite from the Upper Mustang region of central Nepal.  With this technique, we calculate a mean chemical date that is consistent with isotope-dilution thermal ionization mass spectrometry (ID-TIMS) U-Pb dates obtained from seven other uraninite grains and a monazite crystal from the same sample.  Electron microprobe chemical dating yields results that typically will be an order of magnitude less precise than conventional dates: in the specific case of the Mugu granite, single point chemical dates each have ca. 1.5 Ma 2\u03c3 (95%) confidence level uncertainties.  However, the mean chemical date of 15 point analyses of the crystal we study has a 2SE (2 standard error) uncertainty of ca. 400 ka, comparable to uncertainties obtained with ID-TIMS.  These results show that electron microprobe chemical dating of uraninite has substantial promise as a reconnaissance tool for the geochronology of young granitic rocks.  The electron microprobe work also reveals substantial chemical complexity within uraninite that must be taken into account. The analyzed crystal displays a texturally and chemically distinctive core and rim that suggests episodic growth. Concentration gradients in U, Th, and Y across the boundary imply diffusive modification. We estimate the diffusivity of U, Th, and Y in uraninite at ca. 700 \xb0C to be > 10-7 cm2 s-1.  In contrast, Pb shows no distinctive concentration gradient across the core-rim boundary, implying that Pb has a much higher diffusivity in uraninite than U, Th, or Y.

McNulty'], u'2007-06-28', u'Soils store about 1.5\xd710^16 g of carbon (C), about as much as terrestrial vegetation and atmosphere combined 1. The complex interplay between factors that regulate C release from soil through respiration is not completely understood, but could potentially exert strong influence on global radiation balance and climate change2. Respiration exerts strong effect on the spatial heterogeneity of terrestrial C cycle 3 and its temporal variation remains more poorly understood compared to gross ecosystem production (GEP) 4. This variation can analytically be attributed to changes in environmental factors, but forecasting individual deviations remains a challenge 4. Here we propose that deviations of the typical covariance pattern of primary environmental drivers (temperature, T, and moisture, presented in this study as volumetric water content, VWC) may affect the deviations of respiratory C loss. Typically, T and VWC are inversely related, with warm periods being generally drier and vice versa, and therefore the stimulating effect of one factor is counterbalanced by unfavorable levels of the other 5. However, should the driving variables be positively related, respiratory carbon release can increase significantly (Supplementary Fig. 1a). This hypothesis is supported by two consecutive years of ecosystem-level and soil carbon exchange data that differed in rain fall periodicity and T-VWC-covariance. With changing climate patterns, including the intensity and frequency of rainfall events, there is the possibility that the covariance patterns of T and VWC may change, and more frequent periods of positive T-VWC covariance may lead to greater loss of soil carbon, and contribute to greater radiative forcing on Earth\u2019s energy budget.

P. Rosa'], u'2012-03-28', u'Foraging bees use colour cues to help identify rewarding from unrewarding flowers, but as conditions change, bees may require behavioural flexibility to reverse their learnt preferences. Perceptually similar colours are learnt slowly by honeybees and thus potentially pose a difficult task to reverse-learn. Free-flying honeybees (N = 32) were trained to learn a fine colour discrimination task that could be resolved at ca. 70% accuracy following extended differential conditioning, and were then tested for their ability to reverse-learn this visual problem multiple times. Subsequent analyses identified three different strategies: \u2018Deliberative-decisive\u2019 bees that could, after several flower visits, decisively make a large change to learnt preferences; \u2018Fickle- circumspect\u2019 bees that changed their preferences by a small amount every time they encountered evidence in their environment; and \u2018Stay\u2019 bees that did not change from their initially learnt preference. The next aim was to determine if there was any advantage to a colony in maintaining bees with a variety of decision-making strategies. To understand the potential benefits of the observed behavioural diversity agent-based computer simulations were conducted by systematically varying parameters for flower reward switch oscillation frequency, flower handling time, and fraction of defective \u2018target\u2019 stimuli. These simulations revealed that when there is a relatively high frequency of reward reversals, fickle-circumspect bees are more efficient at nectar collection. However, as the reward reversal frequency decreases the performance of deliberative-decisive bees becomes most efficient.

Research has shown that these birds are presumably fish-eating during their incubation period, coinciding with the flooding season when fish come to areas around great lakes. Such a diet may be explained by the necessity of high-energy food during the incubating period as well as the particularity of this species for leaving plant resources around the nest point for the period of the first days after chick hatching.

Violation of the competitive exclusion principle in plankton communities provides an example. A promising solution of this \u2018paradox of the plankton\u2019 comes from theories involving cyclic competition, an evolutionary analogue of the classical rock-paper-scissors (RPS) game. However, modeling probabilistic RPS structures, one encounters a fundamental difficulty: the pairs rock-scissors, scissors-paper, and paper-rock possess representations in separate Kolmogorovian probability spaces, but a single global probability space for entire triplets does not exist. Populations that take part in cyclic competition should therefore involve probabilistic incompatibilities, analogous to those occurring in quantum mechanics. Here, using experimental data collected from 1990 to 2011 on the RPS cycles of lizards, we show that the incompatibilities are indeed unavoidable, and the data cannot be reconstructed from a single Kolmogorovian probability space. We then prove that the effect is genuinely quantum probabilistic, i.e. all the probabilities can be formulated in terms of a single density matrix and a set of non-commuting projectors. This formal quantum structure is dormant in games where probabilities of strategies do not entangle with probabilities of payoffs, and thus could be overlooked. In more realistic scenarios, involving games \u2018with ace in a sleeve\u2019, the non-Kolmogorovian structure can be activated. Surprisingly, lizards occasionally do play such games.

Firstly, the imminent cause producing bias in logarithmic regression was analyzed, and a new correction factor was presented with which three commonly used bias correction factors were examined together, and the results showed that the correction factors presented here and derived by Baskerville (1972) should be recommended, which could insure the corrected model to be asymptotically consistent with that fitted by weighted regression. Secondly, the fitting results of weighted regression for non-linear models, using the weight function based on residual errors of the model estimated by ordinary least squares (OLS) and the general weight function (w=1/\u0192(x)2) presented by Zeng (1998) respectively, were compared with each other that showed two weight functions worked well and the general function was more applicable. It was suggested that the best way to fit non-linear models with heteroscedasticity would be using weighted regression, and if the total relative error of the estimates from the model fitted by the general weight function was more than a special allowance such as \xb13%, a better weight function based on residual errors of the model fitted by OLS should be used in weighted regression.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/6708/version/1', [u'Ecology'], [u'Academy of Forest Inventory and Planning, State Forestry Administration of China', u'Institute of Forest Resources Information, Chinese Academy of Forestry']]

[u'Fighting Risky Population Synchronization: Desynchronization and Stabilization in Spatially Structured Ecological Systems', ['Ming Luo'], u'2011-12-07', u'Population synchronization exists ubiquitously in ecological systems, of which the underlying causes and the roles in species extinction remain a perplexing puzzle. It is generally believed that the coherence of population dynamics is detrimental and regarded as a major cause of global extinction. A central but unsolved question in ecology of great importance for conservation and biological control is how to destroy the pernicious coherent structures. Here, a top-down approach is adopted to tackle the challenge. A feedback strategy accordingly is applied to stabilize the metacommunity, i.e., to reduce excessive metapopulation fluctuations by means of introducing or removing a planned number of individuals. As a result, the feedback desynchronizes correlated population oscillations, giving rise to either complex asynchronous traveling waves or \u201camplitude death\u201d; cessation of all individual population cycles. Together with the construction of corridors, my method may provide an efficient way to protect those species threatened as a result of, e.g. habitat fragmentation. I anticipate my essay provides a general mechanism against widespread harmful synchronization in physical and biological systems, for example, for developing a \u201cbrain anti-pacemaker\u201d for neurological diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s disease and epilepsy closely linked to pathologically synchronized neuronal discharges.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/6673/version/1', [u'Ecology', u'Neuroscience'], [u'Tongji University, School of Aerospace Engineering and Applied Mechanics']]

[u'Variety in evolutionary strategies favours biodiversity in habitats of moderate productivity', ['Simon Pierce'], u'2011-11-17', u'The mechanism whereby biodiversity varies between habitats differing in productivity is a missing link between ecological and evolutionary theory with vital implications for biodiversity conservation, management and the assessment of ecosystem services. A unimodal, humped-back relationship, with biodiversity greatest at intermediate productivities, is evident when plant, animal and microbial communities are compared across productivities in nature. However, the mechanistic, evolutionary basis of this observation remains enigmatic. We show, for natural and semi-natural plant communities across a range of bioclimatic zones, that biodiversity is greatest where communities include species with widely divergent values for phenotypic traits involved in resource economics and reproductive timing, coinciding with intermediate biomass production, whilst each productivity extreme is associated with small numbers of specialised species with similar trait values. Our data demonstrate that evolution can generate a greater range of phenotypes where large, fast-growing species are prevented from attaining dominance and extreme adaptation to a harsh abiotic environment is not a prerequisite for survival.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/6618/version/1', [u'Ecology', u'Plant Biology', u'Evolutionary Biology'], [u'University of Milan, Department of Plant Production']]
[u'Collective Animal Behavior from Bayesian Estimation and Probability Matching', ['Alfonso Perez-Escudero', 'Gonzalo G. de Polavieja'], u'2011-11-07', u'Animals living in groups make movement decisions that depend, among other factors, on social interactions with other group members. Our present understanding of social rules in animal collectives is mainly based on empirical fits to observations, with less emphasis in obtaining first-principles approaches that allow their derivation. Here we show that patterns of collective decisions can be derived from the basic ability of animals to make probabilistic estimations in the presence of uncertainty. We build a decision-making model with two stages: Bayesian estimation and probabilistic matching.In the first stage, each animal makes a Bayesian estimation of which behavior is best to perform taking into account personal information about the environment and social information collected by observing the behaviors of other animals. In the probability matching stage, each animal chooses a behavior with a probability equal to the Bayesian-estimated probability that this behavior is the most appropriate one. This model derives very simple rules of interaction in animal collectives that depend only on two types of reliability parameters, one that each animal assigns to the other animals and another given by the quality of the non-social information. We test our model by obtaining theoretically a rich set of observed collective patterns of decisions in three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, a shoaling fish species. The quantitative link shown between probabilistic estimation and collective rules of behavior allows a better contact with other fields such as foraging, mate selection, neurobiology and psychology, and gives predictions for experiments directly testing the relationship between estimation and collective behavior.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/5939/version/2', [u'Ecology'], [u'Cajal Institute, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\xedficas']]
[u'Levy flights are not evolved behavior', ['Jay Willis', 'Lucas Merckelbach'], u'2011-11-02', u'Tracks of moving animals have many short moves interspersed with longer moves, and frequencies of all moves together often indicate Levy flights (a type of power law)1. The Levy flight foraging hypothesis suggests that, \u2018since Levy flights and walks can optimize search efficiencies, therefore natural selection should have led to adaptations for Levy flight foraging1 and it has been apparently supported by several studies of large numbers of tracks of marine animals234. We show that Levy flights are caused by marine animals attempting to move in simple ways and they are unlikely to be evolved behavior. We do this by analyzing the tracks of autonomous underwater gliders which conform to Levy flights while they were programmed to perform simple directed movement. Gliders are autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV), propelled by a buoyancy engine5.The principle of operation is that by alternating positive and negative buoyancy, the winged AUV glides through the ocean in an undulating path, resurfacing after a pre-programmed number of undulations. During the periods at the surface, which typically last 15 minutes, GPS is used for positioning before and after transmission of data via a satellite link, whereas underwater the trajectory is deadreckoned from measured heading, pitch and pressure rate. Thus they are potentially a good analogy to a navigating animal which may also attempt to make directed movements using the best available (and often intermittent6) navigational information.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/6564/version/1', [u'Ecology'], [u'Southampton University, International Centre for Ecohydraulics Research', u'Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht, Zentrum fur Material- und Kustenforschung GmbH']]
[u'A similarity criterion for forest growth curves', ['Georgii A. Alexandrov', 'Georgy S.

Here we treat the same subject from the viewpoint of similarity theory. Our goal is to form a dimensionless ratio of biophysical entities that could parameterize the diversity of forest growth curves. (Such ratios are called similarity criteria.)  Pursuing this goal, we focus on the analogy between tree crown growth and atomic explosion. A blast wave is formed when the rate of energy release is much higher than the rate of energy dissipation. The difference between the rates of energy release and dissipation is the essence of this phenomenon. The essential feature of crown growth is the difference between the rates of non-structural carbohydrate supply and demand. Since the rate of supply is much higher than the rate of demand, the flow of non-structural carbohydrates achieves the tips of branches and enables the radial growth of crown. Proceeding from these ideas, we derived the similarity criterion which supposedly captures the \u201cessence of growth\u201d that emerges from the geometric similarity of tree crowns.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/6561/version/1', [u'Ecology', u'Plant Biology'], [u'A.

[u'Weight, Length, and Growth in Cutbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss x clarkii)', ['David Parker', 'Thomas Avers', 'Michael Courtney'], u'2011-09-19', u'Background:  The cutbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss x clarkii) is a fertile hybrid of rainbow and cutthroat trout.  Little published length-weight data is available for this hybrid, and a standard weight curve is not established.  Eleven Mile Reservoir is a clear mountain reservior in Colorado with a surface area of 13.4 square kilometers, an average depth of 10 m, and a maximum depth of 41 m.  80,000 cutbow trout were stocked through the ice in late winter before samples were taken.Materials and Methods: Angling provided 171 samples which were weighed and measured (total length and fork length).  Dressed weight was also determined with the scales, head, and entrails removed.  Estimates of parameters a and b in the model, W(L) = aLb, were obtained by both linear least-squares (LLS) regression (log(W) = log(a) + b log(L)) and non-linear least-squares (NLLS) regression, where W is weight in kg and L is length in cm.  Parameter estimates of an improved model, W(L) = (L/L1)b, were also determined by NLLS regression; the parameter L1 is the typical length of a fish weighing 1 kg.  The resulting best-fit parameters, parameter standard errors, and covariances are compared between the two models.  Average weight and length are considered for each month from June through October to estimate growth rates for fish stocked over the winter.  Standard weights (relative to the rainbow trout and cutthroat trout standard weight curves) are also determined, along with the ratio of total length to fork length and typical dressed weight percentage.    Results:  The improved model parameter estimates were b = 2.662 and L1 = 45.32 cm, with correlation coefficient r = 0.969.  From June to October, mean relative weight decreased from 101.5% to 93.6% relative to the rainbow trout standard weight and 114.5% to 103.2% relative to the cutthroat trout standard weight as mean total lengths increased from 34.4 cm to 41.9 cm and the mean weights increased from 0.505 kg to 0.830 kg.  Typical dressed weight is 71% of the total weight.  Conclusion: Eleven mile reservoir is an excellent trout fishery, capable of producing large numbers of cutbow trout in good condition.  The cutbow trout is well suited to this kind of mountain reservoir and grows fast.  As might be expected, the weights of cutbow trout of a given length tend to fall between the standard weights of the rainbow and the cutthroat.

[u'A decline in pollinator dependent vegetable crop productivity in India indicates pollination limitation and consequent agro-economic crises.', ['Parthiba Basu', 'Ritam Bhattacharya', 'Pietro Ianetta'], u'2011-06-21', u'Approximately 70% of the tropical crop species depend on pollinators for optimum yields (Roubik, 1995, Klein 2007). The economic value of such pollinated crops to India is $726 million and India is the world\u2019s second largest vegetable producer (Sidhu, 2005). This status has been underpinned by large-scale changes in land-use and pesticide dependency (Fazal, 2000; Shaw & Satish, 2007). A method (c.f. Aizen et al. 2008) that partitions crops into categories depending on their relative pollinator dependence (Index of pollinator dependence, DI) was applied to analysis of vegetable yields for India over 45 years (1963-2008) using FAO data. This has revealed that since 1993, relative yields of crop production has either flattened or declined, while pollinator non dependent crops show no similar decline. This pattern of yield limitation may be due to several factors, among which pollinator limitation would be a major factor (Kearns et al. 1998) and this risk is discussed. Pollinator decline will have serious socio-economic consequences for countries like India, which host a large population of small and marginal farms for whom falling yield level would be critical for subsistence (Kearns et al. 1998; Kremen et al., 2002; Klein et al., 2007; Potts et al., 2010).

[u'Errors in Length-weight Parameters at FishBase.org', ['Michael Courtney', 'Simeon Cole-Fletcher', 'Lucas  Marin-Salcedo', 'Ajaya Rana'], u'2011-04-27', u'Background:  FishBase.org is an on-line database of fish related data that has been cited over 1500 times in the fisheries literature.  Length-weight relationships in fish traditionally employ the model, W(L) = aLb, where L is length and W is weight.  Parameters a and b are catalogued by FishBase for a large number of sources and species.  FishBase.org detects outliers in a plot of log(a) vs. b to identify dubious length-weight parameters.Materials and Methods: To investigate possible errors, length-weight parameters from FishBase.org were used to graph length-weight curves for six different species: channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), black crappie (Pomoxis nigromacalatus), largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), flathead catfish  (Pylodictis olivaris), and lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) along with the standard weight curves (Anderson and Neumann 1996, Bister et al. 2000).  Parameters noted as \u201cdoubtful\u201d by FishBase were excluded.  For each species, variations in curves were noted, and the minimum and maximum predicted weights for a 30 cm long fish were compared with each other and with the standard weight for that length.  For lake trout, additional comparisons were made between the parameters and study details reported in FishBase.org for 6 of 8 length-weight relationships and those reported in the reference (Carlander 1969) for those 6 relationships.  Results: In all species studied, minimum and maximum curves produced with the length-weight parameters at FishBase.org are notably different from each other, and in many cases predict weights that are clearly absurd.  For example, one set of parameters predicts a 30 cm rainbow trout weighing 44 g.    For 30 cm length, the range of weights (relative to the standard weight) for each species are: channel catfish (31.4% to 193.1%), black crappie (54.0% to 149.0%), largemouth bass (28.8% to 130.4%), rainbow trout (14.9% to 113.4%), flathead catfish (29.3% to 250.7%), and lake trout (44.0% to 152.7%).  Ten of the twelve extreme curves reference two sources (Carlander 1969 and Carlander 1977).  These two sources are used for a total of 100 different species at FishBase.org.  In the case of lake trout, comparing the length-weight table at FishBase.org and the cited source (Carlander 1969) revealed that while 5 of 6 total length measurements were incorrectly reported as fork lengths by FishBase.org, all parameters accurately reflected the source.  Comparing the length-weight relationships of the source (Carlander 1969) with the table of weights in different length ranges reveals the length-weight parameters in the source are clearly in error.  However, FishBase.org also neglects to specify clearly distinguished subspecies and/or phenotypes such as siscowet and humper lake trout.Conclusion: Length-weight tables at FishBase.org are not generally reliable and the on-line database contains dubious parameters.  Assurance of quality probably will require a systematic review with more careful and comprehensive methods than those currently employed.

Little published data is available on length-weight relationships of channel catfish in Michigan.  Though there is no record of public or private stocking, channel catfish appeared in Lake Diane between 1984 and 1995 and it has developed into an excellent fishery. Materials and Methods: Sport angling provided 38 samples which were weighed and measured (fork length).  Fillets were also weighed.  The best fit estimates of parameters a and b in the model, W(L) = aLb, were obtained by both linear least-squares (LLS) regression (log(W) = log(a) + b log(L)) and non-linear least-squares (NLLS) regression.  Best-fit parameters of an improved model, W(L) = (L/L1)^b, were also determined by NLLS regression; the parameter L1 is the typical length of a fish weighing 1 kg.  The resulting best-fit parameters, parameter standard errors, and covariances are compared between the two models.  The average relative weight for this sample of channel catfish is also determined, along with the typical meat yield obtained by filleting.   Results:  NLLS regression yields parameter estimates of b = 3.2293 and a = 0.00522.  The improved model yields the same estimate for the exponent, b, and a length estimate (parameter L1) of 45.23 cm.  Estimates of uncertainty and covariance are smaller for the improved model, but the correlation coefficient is r = 0.995 in both cases.  LLS regression produced different parameter values, a = 0.01356 and b = 2.9726, and a smaller correlation coefficient, r = 0.980.  On average, catfish in the sample weighed 106.0% of the standard weight, (Brown et al.) and the linear regression (no slope) of fillet yield vs. total weight suggests a typical fillet yield of 28.1% with r = 0.989.Conclusion: Most of the fish in the sample were above the standard weight, heavier than the 75th percentile for their length.  Channel catfish are doing well in Lake Diane and the population is well matched to the food supply.  Management should attempt to maintain current population levels.   In this case, the improved length-weight model, W(L) = (L/L1)^b, provided lower uncertainties in parameter estimates and smaller covariance than the traditional model.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/5706/version/1', [u'Ecology'], [u'USAFA']]

As ants can be studied virtually everywhere from forest interiors below ground, right up to the kitchen, we attempted a study to assess the ant species richness in a variety of habitats in and around Amravati city. The prime objective of this study is to prepare a partial checklist of ants of Amravati and to compare species richness between selected study sites. Eight study sites with different levels and types of vegetation were selected for the study.We employed an \u201call out search\u201d method for collection in the months of June and July 2010. Ants were hand collected using a brush and forecep during the day time for 6 hrs at each study site. Collected samples were preserved in 70% alcohol in the Department of Zoology, Govt. Vidarbha Institute of Science & Humanities, Amravati.We identified Ants up to the genus level by using a Stemi DV4 Stereo microscope based on taxonomic keys of (Holldobles & Wilson, 1990; Bolton, 1994; Mathew & R.N. Tiwari, 2000).During the present study a total of 34 species of 20 genera have been recognized from Amravati city representing five subfamilies namely Myrmicinae, Formicinae, Ponerinae, Dolichoderinae and Pseudomyrmicinae. Out of this subfamily, Myrmicinae is the most abundant having 11 genera including the genus Rhoptromyrmex. It has been recorded for the first time in this region, followed by Formicinae with four genera for being recorded for the first time as genus Oecophylla. Subfamily Ponerinae and Dolichoderinae were recorded only with two genera each; while the subfamily Pseudomyrmicinae where recorded very poorly with only one genera from G.V.I.S.H. campus.Few ant genera such as Crematogaster and Myrmicaria of subfamily Myrmicinae, Camponotus and Polyrhachis of subfamily Formicinae and Leptogenys of subfamily Ponerinae were mostly found in all the habitats and most localities. Few genera are confined to few localities or habitat types, such as Rhoptromyrmex and Oecophylla recorded only from Pohara forests. Genus Tetraponera of subfamily Pseudomyrmicinae were collected from the tree trunk of Azadirakhta indica in the G.V.I.S.H. campus. Comparison of ant species distribution between the different study sites revealed that ant species richness was highest in Pohara forest with 28 species & lowest with 9 species around urban areas. Relatively high ant species richness was recorded at all the study sites such as the Agriculture field, Tree plantation area, and the Wadali and Chhatri Garden. On the other hand, ant species richness was low around urban houses compared to rural houses due to little or no vegetation and high levels of disturbance.

[u'Why do many animals move with a predominance of roughly forward directions?', ['Kevin Duffy'], u'2010-10-31', u'Animal movements can influence their ecology and demographics. Animal movements are often characterized by path structures with directional persistence. The extent to which directional persistence improves forage success is investigated in this paper using theoretical simulations. It is shown that a movement strategy with directional persistence enables simulated animals to find more forage as compared to a random movement strategy. Situations where resources are chosen with certainty (optimally) are even more successful. Choosing resource with certainty cannot result in directional persistence. However, in cases where animals choose with certainty adjacent cells with resource but continue in their existing direction if none of these have resources then results include directional persistence. It is posited here that this combined strategy is the most effective because if optimal foraging works it is optimally efficient but where foraging is sub-optimal, for a variety of reasons, directional persistence will benefit foraging.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/5156/version/1', [u'Ecology'], [u'Durban University of Technology, Institute of Systems Science']]

Here we use a large-scale experiment in a semi-arid savanna in Kenya to show that wild ungulates do depress cattle performance (weight gain) during the dry season, indicating a competitive effect, but enhance cattle performance during the wet season, signifying facilitation. This is the first experimental demonstration of either competitive or facilitative effects of an assemblage of native ungulates on domestic livestock in a savanna ecosystem, and a unique demonstration of a rainfall-dependent shift in competition-facilitation balance within any herbivore guild.

Chloroplasts are the cellular organelles of photoautotrophic eukaryotes in which photosynthesis is conducted. Although the initial suggestion from Mereschkowsky (1905) that cyanobacteria are the ancestors of chloroplasts was greeted with skepticism, the idea is now widely accepted. Here we attempt to resolve and date the cyanobacterial ancestry of the chloroplast using phylogenetic analysis and molecular clocks, because until now, the long-standing question of, from which, among the vast diversity of cyanobacteria, did chloroplasts evolve, has not been resolved. We found that chloroplasts form a monophyletic lineage, are most closely related to subsection I, N2-fixing unicellular cyanobacteria (Order Chroococcales), and heterocyst-forming Order Nostocales cyanobacteria are their sister group. The appearance of Nostocales and of Chroococcales occurred during the Paleoproterozoic, and chloroplasts appeared in the mid-Proterozoic. The capability of N2-fixation in cyanobacteria appeared once during the late Archaen and early Proterozoic eons. Furthermore, we found that oxygen-evolving cyanobacteria could have appeared in the Archean.

The so-called SLOSS debate \u2013 should we have a Single Large reserve Or Several Small reserves \u2013 features in every conservation text book and is central to conservation theory. Population dynamic models suggest that the design that minimizes the risk of extinction of species is case-specific, with the optimal number of reserves ranging between one and very many. Uncertainty is pervasive in ecology, but, the previous analyses of the SLOSS debate have not considered how uncertainty in the model of extinction risk might influence the optimal design. Here we show that when uncertainty is considered, the SLOSS problem is simplified and driven more by the aspirations of the manager than the population dynamics of the species. For a given budget of land area to be reserved in a region, the optimal solution is to have on the order of twenty or fewer reserves for any species.

In contrast to previous hypotheses, Mantel tests show that body size does not coevolve with diet. However, gape size tightly matches diet (birds vs. lizards) across populations, even after controlling for the effects of body size, genetic, and geographic distance.

Additionally, we analyzed interaction between baseline fitness level and changes in fitness. Methods: This is a three years longitudinal study of 345 high school students aged 11-19 years. Students were invited to perform tests from Fitnessgram battery for strength (curl-ups, push-up), and Cardiorespiratory fitness (20m-shuttle run). PAI and ST were evaluated using a standard questionnaire. Standardized scores of physical fitness tests were summed (ZPF). Changes over time, were calculated \u03941 (TP1 minus TP0), \u03942 (TP2 minus TP1), and \u0394total (TP2 minus TP0). Results: Changes in PAI were positively and independently associated with changes in ZPF in \u03941, \u03942, and \u0394total. No significant associations of \u0394ST and \u0394ZPF were found. \u0394BMI was negative associated with \u0394ZPF in \u0394total. Participants with higher fitness levels at baseline were those who showed positive changes in PAI over \u0394total, decreased screen time and had the lowest increase in BMI over three years compared with those who were low-fit at baseline.

Yet SAR11 sequences are rarely detected in fosmid libraries, suggesting that the widespread abundance may be an artefact of PCR cloning and that SAR 11 has a relatively low abundance. Here the relative abundance of SAR11 is explored in both a fosmid library and a metagenomic sequence data set from the same biological community taken from fjord surface water from Bergen, Norway. Pyrosequenced data and 16S clone data confirmed an 11-15% relative abundance of SAR11 within the community. In contrast not a single SAR11 fosmid was identified in a pooled shotgun sequenced data set of 100 fosmid clones. This under-representation was evidenced by comparative abundances of SAR11 sequences assessed by taxonomic annotation; functional metabolic profiling and fragment recruitment. Analysis revealed a similar under-representation of low-GC Flavobacteriaceae. We speculate that the fosmid bias may be due to DNA fragmentation during preparation due to the low GC content of SAR11 sequences and other underrepresented taxa.

In comparisons of the power available from muscle and the mechanical power required to fly, theoretical studies have predicted that the margin between the powers should decrease with body size and that flying animals have a maximum body size. However, predicting an absolute value of this upper limit has been difficult because wing morphology and flight styles vary among species. Albatrosses and petrels have long, narrow, aerodynamically efficient wings and are considered to be soaring birds. Here, using animal-borne accelerometers, we show that scaling analyses of wing-flapping frequencies in these seabirds indicate that the maximum size limit for soaring animals is a body mass of 41 kg and a wingspan of 5.1 m. Soaring seabirds were observed to have two modes of flapping frequencies: vigorous flapping during takeoff and sporadic flapping during cruising flight. In these species, high and low flapping frequencies were found to scale with body mass (mass -0.30 and mass -0.18) in a manner similar to the predictions from biomechanical flight models (mass -1/3 and mass -1/6). The scaling relationships predicted that animals larger than the limit will not be able to flap fast enough to stay aloft under unfavourable wind conditions. Our result therefore casts doubt on the flying ability of large, extinct pterosaurs.

However one of the major problems with interpreting accelerometer data is that rotation of the sensor alters the output and obtaining independent orientation information is currently difficult. For the specific case of leaping locomotion full orientation information is unecessary as long as an independent measure of height change is available such as can be obtained from a sensitive pressure sensor. Therefore a 4 channel logging system recording 3 accelerometry axes combined with a channel measuring pressure could be used to accurately assess leaping locomotion. This approach should also work for any locomotion where acceleration is limited to the vertical plane but in practice it may be restricted by the sensitivity and acquisition characteristics of the pressure measurement system. Ultimately it should be a useful addition to the range of measurements available for remote locomotor monitoring particularly for leaping species such as lemurs and other non-human primates.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/2515/version/1', [u'Ecology'], [u'Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester, UK']]

[u'New species from the deep Pacific suggest that carnivorous sponges date back to the Early Jurassic', ['Jean Vacelet', 'Michelle Kelly'], u'2008-09-25', u'Some deep-sea poecilosclerid sponges (Porifera) have developed a carnivorous feeding habit that is very surprising in sponges1. As shown by the typical morphology of their spicules, they most probably evolved from \u201cnormal sponges\u201d under the difficult conditions of a deep-sea environment. Such evolution, which implies the loss of the diagnostic character of the phylum Porifera, i.e. a filter feeding habit through a complex aquiferous system, should be of great interest in the understanding of the origin of metazoans. Some scenarios, based on the hypothesis of the paraphyly of Porifera, allege that metazoans could derive from a sponge filter-feeding body plan. A difficulty, however, is to imagine the transition from a sponge grade of organization to other organization plans2. Carnivorous sponges demonstrate that a functional, non filter-feeding animal may derive from a conventional sponge body plan, albeit nothing is known of the age of this evolution. Here we report that newly discovered species of Chondrocladia from the deep Pacific display special spicules that were previously recorded only as isolated spicules from sediment dating back to the Early Jurassic and Miocene periods.

[u'Using Trees: Myrmecocystus Phylogeny and Character Evolution and New Methods for Investigating Trait Evolution and Species Delimitation (PhD Dissertation)', ["Brian C. O'Meara"], u'2008-09-05', u'1) Rates of phenotypic evolution have changed throughout the history of life, producing variation in levels of morphological, functional, and ecological diversity among groups. Testing for the presence of these rate shifts is a key component of evaluating hypotheses about what causes them. General predictions regarding changes in phenotypic diversity as a function of evolutionary history and rates are developed, and tests are derived to evaluate rate changes. Simulations show that these tests are more powerful than existing tests using standardized contrasts. 2) Species delimitation and species tree inference are difficult problems in the case of recent divergences, especially when different loci have different histories. I quantify the difficulty of the problem and introduce a non-parametric method for simultaneously dividing anonymous samples into different species and inferring a species tree, using individual gene trees as input. This heuristic method seeks to both minimize gene tree \u2013 species tree discordance and excess population structure within a species. Analyses suggest that the method may provide useful insights for systematists working at the species level with molecular data.3) The phylogeny of Myrmecocystus ants is estimated using nine loci, finding that none of the three subgenera are monophyletic, implying repeated evolution of foraging times and particular morphologies. A new partitioned likelihood program, MrFisher, is created from MrBayes to aid analysis of multilocus datasets without assuming priors. Simulations show that using a partitioned likelihood approach in the presence of rate heterogeneity and missing data, as is common in supermatrix analyses, can recover correct branch lengths where non-partitioned likelihood gives predictably biased estimates of branch lengths but the correct topology.4) Evolution of foraging time and coevolution of behavior and morphology in Myrmecocystus ants is examined. New models for reconstructing discrete states along branches of a tree and for examining continuous trait evolution and coevolution with discrete traits are developed and implemented. Foraging transitions between diurnal and nocturnal foraging evidently go through crepuscular intermediates. There is some evidence for increased rates of morphological character evolution associated with changes in foraging regime, but little evidence for particular optimum values for morphological traits associated with foraging.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/2261/version/1', [u'Ecology', u'Evolutionary Biology'], [u'Center for Population Biology, University of California, Davis, USA']]

Alternatively, the ability of an organism to express different phenotypes depending on the environment (i.e. phenotypic plasticity) could produce reproductive isolation2,3. Sexually selected traits are expected to be phenotypically plastic and can result in modifications of the species recognition system and thus originate new species4. Here we show that the population-characteristic male courtship behaviour of a fish (Girardinichthys multiradiatus) is modified in the presence of females from other populations, that this is due to the males responding to subtle cues from females, and that they fail to emulate the female&apos;s population-characteristic behaviour.

The warm regime is characterized by much lower plankton production, which we argue is the primary cause of the degraded infaunal community at the end of the warm regime. In 1997-98, we resampled a depth gradient along a subtidal, high-energy sandy beach (6-24m) in Monterey Bay that was sampled for five years at the end of the last cold regime (1971-75). There was a dramatic decline in the total number species, number of individuals, and biomass by the end of the warm period. There was no overlap in benthic assemblages at all water depths between the decades in either non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination or cluster analysis. In the 1970s, the community dominants in the shallow crustacean zone, centered in 9 m, were pericarid crustaceans, including predacious phoxocephilid amphipods, haustoriid amphipods, and ostracods, which all live in the sediment. The amphipods, in particular, are well adapted to burrowing in sand. The numerical dominants in the deeper polychaete zone (18-24m) were large, sedentary polychaete worms. The largest was a tube-dwelling predator (Nothria) accounting for most of the biomass. The other was a suspension and surface deposit feeding polychaete worm, Magelona. By the 1990s, the most abundant crustacean was a small, swimming amphipod; and the most abundant polychaetes were small, relatively mobile, and deposit feeding. This trend from large size, sedentary, and suspension feeding to smaller size, higher mobility, and deposit feeding also characterizes infaunal shifts from the food-rich continental shelf into the food-poor deep sea. The dominant polychaetes had more opportunistic life histories, and shallow faunal zones extended into deeper water in the 1990s. If global warming continues, the ongoing cold regime may be less productive and the sandy bottom communities should not develop the species composition and high diversity, abundance, and biomass observed in the 1970s.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/2103/version/1', [u'Ecology'], [u'Moss Landing Marine Laboratories']]

However, there is a lack of empirical studies linking plant diversity with altered trophic levels7,8, especially for large herbivores, the important but often neglected, controlling trophic level in terrestrial systems. Here we examine responses in performance of the large generalist herbivore to changes in plant diversity, using an indoor cafeteria trial and a field experiment. Our results show that increased plant diversity improves herbivore performance but it is depressed at highest plant diversity levels. We propose the Disturbance Selection Hypothesis for explaining plant diversity effects on primary consumers. Increasing the number of plant species in grassland, increases consumption and enhances nutrient intake (presumably improving animal fitness) by modifying nutrient balance, toxin dilution and taste modulation. High plant diversity simultaneously intensifies animal diet switching frequency, and weakens the herbivore\u2019s ability to select food, thereby increasing foraging cost and disturbing the herbivore\u2019s selection of forage. Thus, the consequence of plant diversity for large herbivore performance depends on the trade-off between the positive and negative effects. At highest plant diversity the positive effects weaken and negative effects strengthen. We suggest knowledge of the mechanisms is the means for understanding relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, and the management of large herbivores on rangelands used for conservation and grazing.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/2058/version/1', [u'Ecology'], [u'Northeast Normal University, Institute of Grassland Science, China', u'CSIRO, Sustainable Ecosystems, Australia']]
[u'Feeding preferences of Microcerotermes championi (snyder) on different timbers dried at different temperatures under choice and no choice trials', ['Khalid Zamir Rasib'], u'2008-07-06', u'Ten species of wood were tested for their natural resistance and to reveal feeding preferences of M. championi. In \u201cno choice\u201d laboratory experiments, Abies pindrow was found highly resistant and Populus euramericana highly palatable. The impact of drying temperature (60\xb0C, 70\xb0C, 80\xb0C, 90\xb0C and 100\xb0C) was studied. The amount of wood consumed in general, increased with increase in drying temperature indicating that heat contributed to the loss of natural resistance components of the woods. When M. championi was given a choice and the woods were offered in combination of two, this termite species repeated its instinct, easily identified the more preferred wood and consumed more of it. Consequently, M. championi showed maximum feeding on P. euramericana and the minimum on A. pindrow and the mean feeding propensity was significantly different (P < 0.0028). Based on the feeding propensity, the woods are arranged in descending order of preference: Populus euramericana > Azadirachta indica > Cedrus deodara > Pinus roxburghii > Morus alba > Tectona grandis > Mangifera indica > Acacia arabica > Thuja occidentalis > Abies pindrow.

Standard epidemiological models can reproduce many general features of outbreaks. Unfortunately, the large temporal fluctuations which often dominate real-world data are thought to require more complicated, system-specific models involving super-spreaders, specific social network topologies and rewirings, and birth-death processes. However we show here that these large fluctuations have a generic explanation in terms of underlying community dynamics. Communities increasing (or decreasing) in size, act as instantaneous amplifiers (or suppressors) yielding a complex temporal evolution whose features vary dramatically according to the relative timescales of the community dynamics. We uncover, and provide an analytic theory for, a novel epidemiological phase transition driven by the population&apos;s response to an outbreak.

[u'Mechanisms to overcome ecosystem nitrogen and phosphorus limitation', ['Rebecca Ostertag'], u'2008-06-20', u'Nutrients limit plant growth in many ecosystems, and many species develop adaptations to either obtain more nutrients or to avoid losses. Much past ecological work has focused either on temperate nitrogen-limited systems or has addressed infertile soils as a single entity, rather than addressing the nature of the limitation. Although low nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) soils are found worldwide, the consequences of N and P limitation for plants may vary due to fundamental differences in the soil mobility, availability, uptake, and cellular uses of N and P. Using a well-studied chronosequence in the Hawaiian Islands, which contains both low N and P soils but which is dominated by similar plant communities, foliar N and P plant responses to fertilization were examined across a diverse group of species and life forms. Here it is shown that in response to N fertilization, foliar N concentrations do not significantly increase. In contrast, P fertilization leads to highly elevated foliar P concentrations and lower N:P values. This accumulation of P is evident across all species, occurs regardless of site fertility, results in increased concentrations of P in both inorganic and organic forms, and may be highly advantageous due to the patchy nature of soil P availability. Results indicate that greater variation in foliar P than foliar N after fertilization transcends soil nutrient availability and may be widespread among ecosystems. Such P accumulation means that N and P concentrations may not be in close association after pulses of soil P. It also provides a mechanism whereby ecosystem P limitation may be overcome with external inputs more easily than N limitation and points for the need to think about N and P limitation not just as infertile stressful conditions for plants, but as two fundamentally different phenomena.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/1993/version/1', [u'Ecology', u'Plant Biology'], [u'University of Hawaii at Hilo, Department of Biology']]
[u'Bird pollination of Canary Island endemic plants', ['Jeff  Ollerton', 'Louise  Cranmer', 'Ralph Stelzer', 'Steve Sullivan', 'Lars Chittka'], u'2008-06-16', u'The Canary Islands are home to a guild of endemic, threatened bird pollinated plants.  Previous work has suggested that these plants evolved floral traits as adaptations to pollination by flower specialist sunbirds, but subsequently they appear to be have co-opted passerine birds as sub-optimal pollinators. To test this idea we carried out a quantitative study of the pollination biology of three of the bird pollinated plants, Canarina canariensis (Campanulaceae), Isoplexis canariensis (Veronicaceae) and Lotus berthelotii (Fabaceae), on the island of Tenerife.  Using colour vision models, we predicted the detectability of flowers to bird and bee pollinators. We measured pollinator visitation rates, nectar standing crops, as well as seed set and pollen removal and deposition.  These data showed that the plants are effectively pollinated by non-flower specialist passerine birds that only occasionally visit flowers. The large nectar standing crops and extended flower longevities (>10days) of Canarina and Isoplexis suggests that they have evolved bird pollination system that effectively exploits these low frequency non-specialist pollen vectors and is in no way suboptimal.  Seed set in two of the three species was high, and was significantly reduced or zero in flowers where pollinator access was restricted. In L. berthelotii, however, no fruit set was observed, probably because the plants were self incompatible horticultural clones of a single genet.   We also show that, while all three species are easily detectable for birds, the orange Canarina and the red Lotus (but less so the yellow-orange Isoplexis) should be difficult to detect for insect pollinators without specialised red receptors, such as bumblebees. Contrary to expectations if we accept that the flowers are primarily adapted to sunbird pollination, the chiffchaff (Phylloscopus canariensis) was an effective pollinator of these species.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/1977/version/1', [u'Ecology', u'Plant Biology'], [u'University of Northampton', u'Queen Mary University of London']]

By analogy with the proposed policing strategy stabilizing intraspecific cooperation, host sanctions against non N2 fixing, cheating symbionts have been proposed as a force stabilizing mutualism in legume-Rhizobium symbiosis. Following this proposal, penalizations would include decreased nodular rhizobial viability and/or early nodule senescence in nodules occupied by cheating rhizobia. In this work, we analyze the stability of Rhizobium-legume symbiosis when \u201ccheating\u201d strains are present, using an experimental and modelling approach. We used split-root experiments with soybean plants inoculated with two rhizobial strains, a cooperative, normal N2 fixing strain and an isogenic non-fixing, \u201cperfect\u201d cheating mutant derivative that lacks nitrogenase activity but has the same nodulation abilities inoculated to split-root plants. We found no experimental evidence of functioning plant host sanctions to cheater rhizobia based on nodular rhizobia viability and nodule senescence and maturity molecular markers. Based on these experiments, we developed a population dynamic model with and without the inclusion of plant host sanctions. We show that plant populations persist in spite of the presence of cheating rhizobia without the need of incorporating any sanction against the cheater populations in the model, under the realistic assumption that plants can at least get some amount of fixed N2 from the effectively mutualistic rhizobia occupying some nodules. Inclusion of plant sanctions merely reduces the time needed for reaching plant population equilibrium and leads to the unrealistic effect of ultimate extinction of cheater strains in soil. Our simulation results are in agreement with increasing experimental evidence and theoretical work showing that mutualisms can persist or even improve in presence of cheating partners.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/1964/version/1', [u'Ecology', u'Microbiology', u'Evolutionary Biology'], [u'Laboratorio de Ecolog\xeda Matem\xe1tica, Area de Producci\xf3n Org\xe1nica, Facultad de Ciencias Agropecuarias, Universidad Nacional de C\xf3rdoba, Ciudad Universitaria', u' Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Dept. of Informatics, University of Zurich', u' Instituto de F\xedsica de la Facultad de Matem\xe1tica, Astronom\xeda y F\xedsica (IFFMAMAF-CONICET), Universidad Nacional de C\xf3rdoba,Ciudad Universitaria ', u'Dept.

Although in countries like India, which is multi-ethnic having multi socio-economic levels, is typically known for high prevalence of under nutrition, significant proportions of overweight and obese now coexist with the undernourished. Objectives: The study aims to find the prevalence of overweight and obesity, and its association with socio-economic change among Tangkhul Naga women of Manipur, North East India and also to compare with other female populations of India.Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out among 346 Tangkhul Naga tribal women of Manipur, age ranging from 20 to 70 years, divided into five different age groups with ten years interval each. Results and conclusions: Mean BMI was found to be lowest among the youngest age group and it increased with age till fifty nine years and then declined. BMI was assessed using recommended cut-off points for Asians and the prevalence of overweight and obesity among the Tangkhul Naga women was found to be 27.1%. When BMI was assessed using the WHO International Classification of adult overweight and obesity, the prevalence percentage was 9.8. Though the prevalence of obesity among Tangkhul females (2.0%) was low when compared to Indian non-tribal female populations the prevalence of overweight (25.1%) was not far behind. Tangkhul Naga is a population where majority of them were believed to be thin traditionally owing to difficult hilly terrain habitation and physically active lifestyle. With urbanization and economic development, a nutritional transition characterized by improved dietary habits, improvement in socio-economic status and increasingly sedentary lifestyle has been observed which has contributed to the increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity among the Tangkhul Naga tribal women.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/1947/version/1', [u'Ecology'], [u'Department of Anthropology, University of Delhi, Delhi-110007', u' Department of Anthropology, University of Delhi, Delhi-110007']]

The fungus is an asymptomatic endophyte in mature plants, and disease and mortality are expressed in some seedlings, while others remain disease free. Here we show that seedlings bearing the endophyte show enhanced resistance to insect herbivory. However, high light availability triggers pathogenicity of the fungus, while low light favors endosymbiotic development, constraining recruitment of endophyte-infested seedlings to the shaded understory by limiting survival of seedlings in direct light.

During the Second International Barcode of Life Conference in Tapei (September 2007), different plastid regions were proposed as potential plant DNA barcodes, such as atpF-atpH and psbK-psbI, but no consensus on which region to use was reached during the meeting. The largest plant DNA barcoding study to date proposed matK as the best candidate and suggested that in combination with trnH-psbA a slight increase in performance could be achieved. However, no study has tested the suitability of the newly proposed psbK-psbI and atpF-atpH for plant barcoding purposes. Four potential DNA barcodes, matK, trnH-psbA, atpF-atpH, and psbK-psbI, were amplified and sequenced for a selective sampling including mainly trees and shrubs of the flora of the Kruger National Park Africa (South Africa). The performance of each region and also each possible combination of these were tested by applying a battery of metrics and statistical tests. Our results confirm that the second half (5\u2019 end) of matK is the best candidate in a single locus barcoding approach reaching 87.5% of species correctly identified. Combining matK with trnH-psbA and psbK-psbI increased only slightly the performance in discriminating species.

[u'Atmospheric hypoxia limits selection for large body size in insects', ['C Jaco Klok', 'Jon Harrison'], u'2008-04-24', u'Recent geological models indicate a marked increase in atmospheric oxygen partial pressure (aPO2) to 32 kPa in the Permo-Carboniferous (approx. 300 million years ago), subsequently falling to 13 kPa in the Triassic1.These aPO2 changes have been hypothesized to cause multiple major evolutionary events2 including the appearance and subsequent extinction of giant insects and other taxa3, 4. Patterns of increasing tracheal investment in larger insects support this hypothesis5, as do observations of positive relationships between aPO2 and body size in single- or multi-generational experiments with Drosophila melanogaster and other insects6. Large species likely result from many generations of selection for large body size driven by predation, competition or sexual selection7. Thus a crucial question is whether aPO2 influences the capacity of such selection to increase insect size. We tested that possibility by selecting for large body size in five Drosophila melanogaster populations for 11 generations in hypoxic (10 kPa), normoxic (21 kPa) and hyperoxic (40 kPa) aPO2, followed by three generations of normoxia without size selection to test for evolved responses. Average body sizes increased by 15% during 11 generations of size selection in 21 and 40 kPa aPO2 flies and even stronger responses were observed for the flies in the largest quartile of body masses. However, flies selected for large size in 10 kPa aPO2 had strongly reduced sizes compared to those in higher aPO2. Upon return to normoxia, all flies had similar, enlarged sizes relative to the starting populations. These results demonstrated that positive size selection had equivalent genetic effects on all flies independent of aPO2, but that hypoxia provided a physical constraint on body size even in a relatively small insect under strong selection for larger mass. Our data support the hypothesis that Triassic hypoxia may have contributed to a reduction in insect size.

This was stressed recently by Cibulskis et al (2007) in the view of completeness of monthly reporting for cerebral malaria admissions in Papua New Guinea (latitude 6 degree S, 1987-1996). Notably, regardless of the rate of its completeness, the temporal dynamics of admissions was preserved over the years, however, neither raw data nor results on further analyses about eventual inter-annual cyclic components (periods T>1 year) were provided despite obvious graphical patterns for such a specific time structure (chronome). Interestingly, in a recent analysis by Gomez-Elipe et al (2007) on monthly malaria notifications in Burundi, at almost the same latitude (province of Karuzi, >3 degree S, 1997-2001), the data have shown neither trend not periodic oscillations beyond a 6-month (0.5-year) period. Since the graphical representation of both data sets have indicated an eventual existence of inter-annual variations, and because both are located at the same latitude zone, we have further analyzed the data from Burundi for such periodic oscillations. By using a periodogram regression analysis, we discovered a multicomponent cyclic chronome with periods above 12 months (T=17.5-18.0, 27.5 and 65.0-65.5 months, all at p<0.002 in the periodogram of the detrended malaria rates in Burundi remained only that with a peak at  about 1.5 years (period T=17.5-18.0 months, R=0.51, z=5.3).

[u'Towards a cognitive definition of colour vision', ['Peter Skorupski', 'Lars Chittka'], u'2008-04-04', u'In recent years, colour vision abilities have been rather generously awarded to vari-ous invertebrates and even bacteria. This uncertainty of when to diagnose colour vi-sion stems in part from confusing what colour vision can do with what it is. What col-our vision can do is discriminate wavelength independent of intensity. However, if we take this as a definition of what colour vision is, then we might indeed be obliged to conclude that some plants and bacteria have colour vision. Moreover, there is a simi-lar confusion of what are necessary and what are sufficient mechanisms and behav-ioural abilities for colour vision. To humans, seeing in colour means seeing an image in which objects/lights have chromatic attributes \u2013 in contrast to the sensation that we have when viewing monochrome movies, or our experience in dim light when only rod vision is possible. The necessary basic equipment for this is to have at least two types of photoreceptors that differ in spectral sensitivity, and at least one type of spectrally opponent cell to compare the signals from the photoreceptors. Clearly, however, a necessary additional prerequisite for colour vision is to have vision, which entails the identification of shapes, sizes and locations of objects in the world. Thus if an animal has colour vision, it should see an image in which distinct objects/lights have colour attributes. This distinguishes colour vision from what has historically been called wavelength-specific behaviour: a type of behaviour triggered by fixed configurations of spectral receptor signals; however, we discuss difficulties in diagnosing wavelength specific behaviour as an indicator of the absence of colour vision.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/1766/version/1', [u'Ecology', u'Neuroscience'], [u'Biological & Chemical Sciences, Queen Mary, University of London', u'Queen Mary University of London']]

We are interested in how altruistic populations survive in the presence of selfish individuals in a non-stirred, closed and complex nutrient landscape. Well-stirred (landscape-free) but closed environments have a depressing future when selfish individuals arise in a population, a fate known as the tragedy of the Commons. Over-exploitation of a well-stirred communal habitat by selfish individuals which do not follow rules of communal self-regulation ends up in the elimination (extinction) of both the original altruistic inhabitants and the selfish population. In the context of bacterial population, the Commons tragedy that occurs is the consumption of limited resources by the individuals, resulting in metabolic stressing of the bacteria and growth advantages to be gained by defection from a ``social contract\u201d of altruistic cooperation. There is no avoidance of this tragedy and the collapse of an original altruistic wild-type population by an emergent selfish population in a well-stirred but closed environment is inevitable. However, there is a fundamental difference between resource exploitation in a well-stirred homogenous commons and in a heterogenous landscape of nutrients which is not stirred. We show here using a non-stirred nanofabricated habitat landscape that altruists and selfish bacteria can in fact coexist, that they can maintain phenotype diversity and avoid the tragedy of the Commons.

In a game theory model, we demonstrate that the most rational behaviour is to rush to consume rare species, even though this precipitates their extinction. We conclude that the human predisposition to place exaggerated value on rarity probably drives the entire market for luxury goods from reptile skins to exotic woods. Our findings suggest that allowing low levels of legal trade will exacerbate the arbitrary value of rare species and thereby stimulate demand. Only a total ban on trade from the wild (with very strict controls) combined with strong support for farmed equivalents will protect rare species.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/1690/version/1', [u'Ecology'], [u'UMR CNRS 8079 - Universite Paris-Sud, Laboratoire Ecologie, Systematique et Evolution (ESE)', u"UMR 6579, Groupement d'Economie Quantitative d'Aix-Marseille, D\xe9partement de Philosophie Economique"]]

[u'Biodiversity shapes tree species aggregations in tropical forests', ['Shan-Huah Wu', 'Wei-Chun Chao', 'Chang-Fu Hsieh'], u'2008-03-10', u'Spatial patterns of conspecific trees are considered as the consequences of biological interactions and environmental influences. They also reflect species interactions in plant communities. However, biological attributes are often neglected while deliberating the factors shaping species distributions. As rising attentions are paid to spatial patterns of tropical forest trees, we noticed that seven Center of Tropical Forest Sites and four Forest Dynamic Plots in Asia and America have presented analogously high proportions of species with aggregated conspecific individuals coincidently. This phenomenon is distinctive and repudiates fundamental ecology hypotheses which suggested dispersed distributions of conspecific tropical trees due to intensive density and natural enemy pressures in tropical forests. We believe that similar aggregation patterns shared by these tropical forests implies the existence of structuring forces in biogeographical scale instead of habitat heterogeneity in local community scales as scientists have considered. To approach the factors contributing to this cross-continent spatial pattern of trees, we obtained and reviewed ecosystem attributes, including topography, temperature, precipitation, biodiversity, density, and biomass, of these forests. Here we show that the proportions of aggregated species are actually constants independent of any ecosystem attributes regardless the nature of these tropical forests. However, local biodiversity are the major factor determining the number of aggregated species and the aggregation of large individuals of these forests. Aggregation of large trees declines along rising biodiversity, while the numbers of aggregated species increase permanently along lifting biodiversity. We propose a possible equilibrium and saturated status of the tropical forests in accommodating aggregated species. Furthermore, the tight correlations of biodiversity and species aggregation strongly imply the importance of overlooked biological interactions in shaping the spatial patterns in the tropical forests.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/1670/version/1', [u'Ecology'], [u'Life Science, National Taiwan Normal University', u'Ecology & Evolutionary Biology, National Taiwan University']]

Our findings during a farmers\u2019 survey in the Lotkho area of Chitral, Pakistan, revealed that the sheep native to the region, locally called \u201cKari\u201d, gestates for a period of only three months. This duration is 25-40% short of the usual gestation length and is shorter than ever recorded for the species. The mean and mode gestation length (GL) was 110 and 92 days respectively and was concentrated in three distinct clusters: day 87-95, 120-123 and 151-153, accounting for 52% of all observations. GL was influenced by location, season of conception and lambing and the interaction of location with season; had an estimated repeatability of zero. The mean lambing interval was 224.7 \xb15.24 days, ranging between 109 and 467 days. During a trial conducted in a controlled environment, only three out of the 27 copulated ewes conceived, and gestated in 113, 125 and 145 days respectively. Gestation length during the trial supported field findings. The results suggest that GL in Kari sheep is unusual as many ewes gestated in three months, with variations of up to 5 months. Genotype by environment interaction is a possibility. However, reasons for the findings are still not clear and further controlled studies should be carried out to establish and further explore the factor(s) responsible for this unusual and unique manifestation of the Kari with regards to its gestation length.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/1620/version/1', [u'Ecology'], [u'Department of Animal Breeding and Genetics, University of Agriculture Faisalabad']]

We then motivated intruders to fight hard by subjecting them to the threat of predation, and found that they were more likely to win contests. When we also motivated residents to fight hard by placing a female in his burrow (i.e. both rivals were simultaneously motivated to fight due to the perceived increase in resource value), we found that the contests escalated more and that resident males had a slightly increased chance of winning.

Kazura'], u'2008-02-02', u'The ultimate goal of the global programme against lymphatic filariasis is eradication through irrevocable cessation of transmission using 4 to 6 years of annual single dose mass drug administration. The costs of eradication, and logistical and managerial impediments to executing national and regional control programmes, and scientific uncertainty about transmission endpoints, are challenges to the success of this effort, especially in areas of high endemicity where financial resources are limited. We used a combined analysis of empirical community data describing the association between infection and chronic disease prevalence, mathematical modelling, and economic analyses to identify and evaluate the feasibility of setting an infection target level at which the chronic pathology attributable to lymphatic filariasis \u2013 lymphoedema of the extremities (elephantiasis) and hydroceles \u2013 becomes negligible in the face of continuing transmission as a first stage option in achieving the elimination of this parasitic disease. The results show that microfilaria prevalences below a threshold of 3.55% at a blood sampling volume of 1 ml could constitute readily achievable and sustainable targets to control disease due to lymphatic filariasis. They also show that as a result of the high marginal cost of curing the last few individuals to achieve elimination, maximal benefits can occur at the disease control threshold. Indeed, a key finding from our coupled economic and epidemiological analysis is that when initial uncertainty regarding eradication occurs and prospects for improving information to resolve such uncertainty over time exist, it is economically beneficial to adopt a flexible, sequential, eradication strategy based on controlling chronic disease initially. These results suggest that it may be optimal to set phased targets for the elimination of lymphatic filariasis, starting with disease control followed by intensified efforts to eradicate transmission as better knowledge regarding transmission dynamics and issues of implementation feasibility becomes evident. They also illustrate the importance of taking explicit accounts of uncertainties, multi-staged endpoints, and the value of embedding flexibility in the decision making process when determining optimal parasite eradication strategies.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/1564/version/1', [u'Ecology'], [u'Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College', u'National Institute for Medical Research, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania', u'Mathematics Department, London School of Economics and Political Science', u'Center for Global Health and Diseases, Case Western Reserve University']]

Magurran'], u'2007-12-07', u'The universal observation that some species in an ecological community are common, but many more are rare, is neatly encapsulated in a species abundance distribution (SAD)1. However, the shape of the distribution can depend on the currency used to measure abundance 2. Here we show how the SADs for numerical abundance and biomass are related and how this relationship can be used to predict the form of the SAD. When plotted in log numerical abundance, log biomass space, species points lie within an approximately triangular area the limits of which are set by body size range, and the upper limit of abundance in both metrics. Under the simplifying, but reasonable, assumption that the observed scatter of species within this region is random, the shape of the SAD is immediately derived from simple geometrical considerations. For the SAD of numerical abundance this is a power curve. The biomass SAD can be either a power curve or, more frequently, a unimodal curve, which can approximate a log normal. This log triangular random placement model serves as a null hypothesis against which actual communities can be compared. Data from two intensively surveyed local communities indicate that it can give a good approximation, with species scattered within a triangle. Further, we can predict the consequences, for the SAD, of size-selective sampling protocols.  We argue that mechanistic models of SADs must be able to account for the relative abundance of species in alternative currencies.

Epidemics of certain infectious diseases (e.g., influenza) can rise and fall with a well-defined periodicity; this cycling behavior is important because it can have significant implications for the design and effectiveness of control strategies. Here we discuss the methodology that has been used to identify epidemic cycles in longitudinal data sets, and the endogenous and exogenous mechanisms that generate cycling. We then examine the recently proposed hypothesis that syphilis epidemics cycle. This hypothesis was proposed based upon the results of a spectral analysis of a longitudinal data set that had been collected by the (CDC), and the analysis of a syphilis transmission model. We use spectral analysis to reanalyze the CDC\u2019s data set, as well as to analyze a longitudinal mortality data set provided by the CDC. We also use published transmission models to predict the expected dynamics of syphilis epidemics. In contrast to the previous findings we find that: (i) that neither of the CDC\u2019s data sets provide compelling evidence that syphilis epidemics cycle and (ii) published transmission models predict that syphilis epidemics should monotonically decrease (as a function of the treatment rate) rather than cycle.

The basic tenets of influenza genetics5 define gradual changes as drifts caused by point mutations created by a polymerase that lacks a proof reading function.  More abrupt changes have been linked to reassortment, which shuffles the eight sub-genomic segments of the influenza genome in dually infected host. The complex evolution of these viruses has created a challenge in vaccine development.  Swine influenza isolates from 2003 and 2004 have been identified6 that have acquired a human influenza gene, PB1.  My analysis of the eight gene segments found large portions of two genes, PB2 and PA, which were identical matches with 1977 swine isolates7,8.  Additional regions were exact matches with 1998 and 2002 isolates,9,10 demonstrating homologous recombination between earlier genomes.  The absolute fidelity discounts the role of point mutations in gene drift. Moreover the human PB1 gene represented a reservoir for acquisition of polymorphisms in human seasonal flu.

Current molecular phylogenies have predominantly identified Amborella, followed by Nymphaea (water lilies) or Amborella plus Nymphaea, in the ANITA clade (Amborella, Nymphaeales, Illiciaceae, Trimeniaceae and Austrobaileyaceae) as the earliest angiosperm. However, developmental studies suggest that the earliest angiosperm had a 4-cell/4-nucleus female gametophyte and a diploid endosperm represented by Nymphaea, suggesting that Amborella, having an 8-cell/9-nucleus female gametophyte and a triploid endosperm, cannot be representative of the basal angiosperm. This evolution-development discordance is possibly caused by erroneous inference based on phylogenetic signals with low neutrality and/or high saturation. Here we show that the 3rd codon transversion (P3Tv), with high neutrality and low saturation, is a robust high-resolution phylogenetic signal for such divergences and that the P3Tv-based land plant phylogeny cautiously identifies Nymphaea, followed by Amborella, as the most basal among the angiosperm species examined in this study.

The genetic code is an important universal feature of extant organisms and indicates a common ancestry of different forms of life on earth. Known variants of the genetic code can be mainly divided in mitochondrial and nuclear classes. Here we provide a new insight on the origin of the mitochondrial genetic code: we found that its degeneracy distribution can be explained by using a mathematical approach recently developed for the description of the Euplotes nuclear variant of the genetic code. The results point to a primeval mitochondrial genetic code composed of four base codons, which we call tesserae, that, among other features, exhibit outstanding error detection capabilities. The theoretical description suggests also a formulation of a plausible biological theory about the origin of protein coding. Such theory is based on the symmetry properties of hypothetical primeval chemical adaptors between nucleic acids and amino acids (ancient tRNA\u2019s).

The alternative explanation, that recombination is mutagenic, has been rejected by the absence of a similar association between regional recombination rate and nucleotide divergence between species. However, many recent studies show that recombination rates are often very different even in closely related species, questioning whether an association between recombination rate and divergence between species has been tested satisfactorily. To circumvent this problem, we directly surveyed recombination across approximately 43% of the D. pseudoobscura physical genome in two separate recombination maps, and 31.3% of the D. miranda physical genome, and we identified both global and local differences in recombination rate between these two closely related species.  Using only regions with conserved recombination rates between and within species and accounting for multiple covariates, our data support the conclusion that recombination is positively related to diversity because recombination modulates hitchhiking in the genome.  Finally, our data show that diversity around nonsynonymous substitutions is recovered at closer distances in areas of higher recombination than in areas of lower recombination \u2014 empirically demonstrating that recombination rate can limit the size and severity of potential selective sweeps.

[u'The biological cost of consciousness', ['Bernard J. Baars'], u'2012-01-11', u'Some philosophers maintain that consciousness as subjective experience has no biological function. However, conscious brain events seem very different from unconscious ones. The cortex and thalamus support the reportable qualitative contents of consciousness. Subcortical structures like the cerebellum do not. Likewise, attended sensory stimuli are typically reportable as conscious, while memories of those stimuli are not so reportable until they are specifically recalled.  Reports of conscious experiences in normal humans always involve subjectivity and an implicit observing ego. Unconscious brain events are not reportable, even under optimal conditions of report. While there are claimed exceptions to these points, they are rare or poorly validated. Normal consciousness also implies high availability (rapid conscious access) of the questions routinely asked of neurological patients in the Mental Status Examination, such as common sense features of personal identity, time, place, and social context. Along with \u201ccurrent concerns,\u201d recent conscious contents, and the like, these contents correspond to high frequency items in working memory. While working memory contents are not immediately conscious, they can be rapidly re-called to consciousness. The anatomy and physiology of reportable conscious sensorimotor contents are ultraconserved over perhaps 200 million years of mammalian evolution. By comparison, full-fledged language is thought to arise some 100,000 years ago in homo sapiens, while writing, which enables accel-erated cultural development, dates between 2.5 and 6 millennia. Contrary to some claims, therefore, conscious waking precedes language by hundreds of millions of years. Like other major adaptations, conscious and unconscious brain events have distinctive biological pros and cons. These involve information processing efficiency, metabolic costs and benefits, and behavioral pros and cons. The well known momentary limited capacity of conscious contents is an example of an information processing cost, while the very large and energy-hungry corticothalamic system makes costly metabolic demands. After a century of scientific neglect, fundamental concepts like \u201cconscious,\u201d \u201cunconscious,\u201d \u201cvoluntary\u201d and \u201cnon-voluntary\u201d are still vitally important, because they refer to major biopsychological phenomena that otherwise are difficult to discuss.

The dynamic shape changes during the cardiac cycle of systole and diastole in valvular regurgitations when ventricular volumes are within normal range have proved that shape changes are clearly dissociated from volume changes in the early stages. In the scenario of advanced heart failure, several therapeutic interventions have been tried with variable success. These therapies aim at decreasing the ventricular equator, and hence its volume. However, the ventricular shape may still be spherical leading to suboptimal function.

These odors are rich source of information, and are perceived by sophisticated olfactory systems, that have evolved over time. The sense of smell helps species to localize prey, evade predators, explore food and recognize viable mates. In humans, memoirs, thoughts, emotions, and associations are more readily reached through the sense of smell than through any other channel. This suggests that olfactory processing is imperative and may differ fundamentally from processing in other sensory modalities. The molecular age in olfaction initiated in 1991 with the significant discovery of a large, multigene family of olfactory receptors in rat by Linda Buck and Richard Axel (Buck and Axel, 1991). The first cloned olfactory receptors consisted of a diverse repertoire of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) with seven-trans membrane topology, and they were sparsely expressed in the olfactory epithelium. This Nobel Prize worthy pioneering discovery, together with availability of modern techniques and numerous completely sequenced genomes opened the way to characterize the gene families of olfactory receptors through exhaustive computational data mining in different species genome as well as by in vitro biology.

It is widely believed that primordial endosymbiosis occurred in the last common ancestor of all algae1, which then diverged into the three primary photosynthetic eukaryotic lineages, viz. the Rhodophyta (red algae), Glaucocystophyta (cyanelle-containing algae) and Viridiplantae (green algae plus all land plants)2. Members of these three groups invariably have double membrane-bound plastids3, a property that endorses the primary endosymbiotic origin of the organelles. On the other hand, the three or four membrane-bound plastids of the evolutionary complicated Chromalveolates [chromista (cryptophytes, haptophytes, and stramenopiles) and alveolata (dinoflagellates, apicomplexans, and ciliates)] are inexplicable in the light of a single endosymbiosis event, thereby necessitating the postulation of the secondary4,5 and tertiary6 endosymbiosis theories where a nonphotosynthetic protist supposedly engulfed a red or a green alga7 and an alga containing a secondary plastid itself was engulfed8 respectively. In the current state of understanding, however, there is no clue about the taxonomic identity of the cyanobacterial ancestor of chloroplasts, even though there is a wide consensus on a single primordial endosymbiosis event. During our metagenomic investigation of a photosynthetic geothermal microbial mat community we discovered a novel order-level lineage of Cyanobacteria that \u2013 in 16S rRNA gene sequence-based phylogeny \u2013 forms a robust monophyletic clade with chloroplast-derived sequences from diverse divisions of Viridiplantae. This cluster diverged deeply from the other major clade encompassing all hitherto known groups of Cyanobacteria plus the chloroplasts of Rhodophyta, Glaucocystophyceae and Chromalveolates. Since this fundamental dichotomy preceded the origin of all chloroplasts, it appears that two early-diverging cyanobacterial lineages had possibly given rise to two discrete chloroplast descents via two separate engulfment events.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/6607/version/1', [u'Microbiology', u'Evolutionary Biology'], [u'Bose Institute, Microbiology']]

We identified two major events during the diversification of the RRM in plants, one at the emergence of green plants, and the other at the water-to-land transition. We focused on proteins that combine a single RRM with a glycine-rich stretch, known as glycine-rich RNA-binding proteins (GRPs).

We provide evidence that plant GRPs form a polyphyletic group.Conclusion:Our work provides insights into the origin of GRPs in plants. We determined that the RRM from plants and cyanobacteria do not have a common origin. We could also determine that the acquisition of the glycine-rich stretch has happened at least on three separate occasions during the evolution of GRPs. One event led to the emergence of cyanobacterial GRPs, while later acquisition events led to the emergence of GRPs in the green lineage. No GRPs were found in red or marine green algae.

The most investigated type of metabolic depression is hibernation. Research into the basic properties of liver mitochondria energetics during hibernation is essential for fundamental biology and medicine. However, the absence of a suitable hepatocyte culture makes it impossible to study the characteristic features of mitochondrial metabolic states in living cells during hibernation. We proposed that under selected conditions, the unicellular eukaryote Tetrahymena pyriformis resembles hepatocytes under hibernation, as (i) both cell types survive under condition of restricted food supply, hypoxia, and accumulation of toxic products of metabolism; (ii) the mechanisms for survival during drastically reduced oxidative metabolism probably developed in the ancestors of the eukaryote mitochondria and may be conserved, in somewhat modified forms, in mitochondria of the ciliates and mammalian cells; (iii) mitochondria isolated from rat liver and Tetrahymena  pyriformis are similar in their energetics properties. The already published results of experiments with Tetrahymena pyriformis and with mitochondria isolated from the liver of hibernating animals are considered in this paper to support and develop this suggestion. Sharp decreases in the maximal uncoupler-stimulated respiration rates in liver mitochondria isolated from the hibernating animals was described in many publications.

Each path phenotype is associated with a reward that determines whether the edges of that path will be multiplicatively strengthened (or weakened). A pair-wise tournament selection algorithm is implemented which compares the reward obtained by two paths. The directed edges of the winning path are strengthened, whilst the directed edges of the losing path are weakened. Edges shared by both paths are not changed (or weakened if diversity is desired). Each time a node is activated there is a probability that the path will mutate, i.e. find an alternative route that bypasses that node. This generates the potential for a novel but correlated path with a novel but correlated phenotype. By this process the more frequently traversed paths are responsible for most of the exploration. Nodes that are inactive for some period of time are lost (which is equivalent to connections to and from them being broken). This network-based natural selection compares favourably with a standard pair-wise tournament-selection based genetic algorithm on a range of combinatorial optimization problems and continuous parametric optimization problems. The network also exhibits memory of past selective environments and can store previously discovered characters for reuse in later optimization tasks. The pathway evolution algorithm has several possible implementations and permits natural selection with unlimited heredity without template replication.

[u'Fish play Minority Game as humans do', ['Sy-Sang Liaw', 'Ruey-Tarng Liu', 'Fei Fang Chung'], u'2010-12-27', u'Previous computer simulations of the Minority Game (MG) have shown that the average agent number in the winning group (i.e., the minority group) had a maximal value such that the global gain was also maximal when an optimal amount of information was available to all agents . This property was further examined and its connection to financial markets has also been discussed . Here we report the results of an unprecedented real MG played by university staff members who clicked one of two identical buttons (A and B) on a computer screen while clocking in or out of work. We recorded the number of people who clicked button A for 1288 games, beginning on April 21, 2008 and ending on October 31, 2010, and calculated the variance among the people who clicked A as a function of time. We find that variance per person decreases to a minimum and rises to a value close to 1/4 which is the expected value when agents click buttons randomly. Our results are consistent with previous simulation results for the theoretical MG and suggest that our agents had employed more information for their strategies as their experience playing the game grew. We also carried out another experiment in which we forced 101 fish to enter one of the two symmetric chambers (A and B). We repeated the fish experiment 500 times and found that the variance of the number of fish that entered chamber A also decreased to a minimum and then increased to a saturated value, suggesting that fish have memory and can employ more strategies when facing the same situation again and again .', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/5440/version/1', [u'Evolutionary Biology'], [u'National Chung Hsing University, Physics']]

Males of concave-eared torrent frog (Odorrana tormota) have ultrasonic communication capacity 1, 2, but it is unknown whether females communicate with ultrasound. Here we show that O. tormota exhibits great sex differences in the auditory frequency sensitivity. Acoustic playback experiments demonstrated that the male\u2019s advertisement calls evoke gravid females\u2019 positive phonotaxis and vocal responses, whereas ultrasonic components of the male\u2019s calls (frequencies above 20 kHz) do not elicit female phonotaxis or vocalization. The behavioral study was complemented by electrophysiological recordings from the auditory midbrain and by laser Doppler vibrometer measurements of the tympanic membrane\u2019s response to acoustic stimuli. These measurements revealed that females have an upper frequency limit up to 16 kHz (threshold 107 dB SPL) and no ultrasound sensitivity, unlike males which have an upper frequency limit of up to 35 kHz (87 dB SPL). Single units in the female auditory midbrain have the best excitatory frequencies (BEFs) peaked around 5 kHz, corresponding to the fundamental frequency (F0) of male\u2019s most calls, whereas the male auditory midbrain units have BEFs mostly above 8 kHz, largely consistent with the F0 of female courtship calls. Females have a frequency sensitive bandwidth (10 dB above threshold) ranged from 2 to 6 kHz, narrower than that males have (5-20 kHz). The velocity amplitude of the tympanic membranes peaked around 5 kHz in females, whereas 7 kHz in males.

[u'Homochirality through Photon-Induced Melting of RNA/DNA: the Thermodynamic Dissipation Theory of the Origin of Life', ['Karo Michaelian'], u'2010-11-04', u'The homochirality of the molecules of life has been a vexing problem with no generally accepted solution to date. Since a racemic mixture of chiral nucleotides frustrates the extension and replication of RNA and DNA, understanding the origin of homochirality has important implications to the investigation of the origin of life. Theories on the origin of life have generally elected to presume an abiotic mechanism giving rise to a large prebiotic enantiomer enrichment. Although a number of such mechanism have been suggested, none has enjoyed sufficient plausibility or relevance to be generally accepted. Here we suggest a novel solution to the homochirality problem based on a recently proposed thermodynamic dissipation theory for the origin of life. The ultraviolet absorption and dissipation characteristics of RNA/DNA point to their origin as photoautorophs, their replication assisted by UV light and temperature, and acting as catalysts for the global water cycle. Homochirality is suggested to have been incorporated gradually into the emerging life as a result of asymmetric right- over left-handed photon-induced denaturation of RNA/DNA occurring when Archean sea surface temperatures became close to the denaturing temperatures of RNA/DNA. This differential denaturing success would have been promoted by the somewhat right-handed circularly polarized submarine light of the late afternoon when surface water temperatures are highest, and a negative circular dichroism band extending from 220 nm up to 260 nm for small segments of RNA/DNA. A numerical model is presented demonstrating the efficacy of such a mechanism in procuring 100% homochirality of RNA or DNA from an original racemic solution in less than 500 Archean years assuming a photon absorption threshold for replication representing the hydrogen bonding energy between complementary strands. Because cholesteric D-nucleic acids have greater affinity for L-amino acids due to a positive structural complementarity, and because D-RNA/DNA+L-amino acid complexes also have a negative circular dichroism band between 200 \u2013 300 nm, the homochirality of amino acids can also be explained by the theory.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/5177/version/1', [u'Genetics & Genomics', u'Evolutionary Biology'], [u'Instituto de Fisica, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico']]
[u'High Perceptual Load Makes Monocular Attention Different', ['Dingyuan Tan'], u'2010-11-02', u'Attention is a fundamental function of the human which is important in our daily life. Perceptual load is thought to play an important role in selective attention1,2. When perceptual load is high, the distracting information will be kept out of perception and will not affect us. When perceptual load is low, the distracting information will be processed deeply by us and will influence us3. However, most of the past research was concerned with binocular attention instead of monocular attention. In spite of the differences such as visual acuity4, stereopsis5,6 between binocular and monocular vision, there were few reports of their difference regarding to perceptual load which means more items and features in our research. Here we show their difference with the application of perceptual load to a selective attention task adapted from Eriksen&apos;s flanker task7. According to our research, monocular subjects are more sensitive to perceptual load with a lower perceptual load keeping them from the distracting effect. The difference may be attributed to less perceptual capacity rather than better attention of monocular vision.

[u'Visualization of Minute Mechanical-Excitation/Relaxation Wave-front Propagation in Myocardial Tissue', ['Hiroshi Kanai', 'Motonao Tanaka'], u'2010-09-22', u'Unlike the case of skeletal muscle, the direction of myocardial contraction does not coincide with the direction of work necessary to eject the intraventricular blood, contributing to great complexity of the wall deformation sequence of cardiac contraction. The advent of advanced techniques (CT1, MRI2,3, SPECT4, echocardiology5-9, electrocardiography10, and magnetocardiography11,12) has enabled to the evaluation of cardiac function and disorders by the measurement of blood flow, pressure, electrical reaction process, and other factors. However, complexity of the contraction sequence is still not fully understood because the dynamic mechanical excitation process, which directly correlates with contraction, cannot be accurately measured based on these electro-magnetic phenomena. Here, developing and using a noninvasive novel imaging modality with high temporal and spatial resolutions13-17, we show that the propagation of the mechanical wave-front occurs at the beginning of each cardiac contraction and relaxation sequence for the first time. The former occurs about 60 ms prior to the ordinarily accepted onset time of the contraction (R-wave of the electrocardiogram). From the apical side of the interventricular septum, close to the terminal of the Purkinje fibers (specialized to carry contraction impulses), a minute velocity component with an amplitude of several tenth micrometers is generated and propagates sequentially to the entire left ventricle, that is, it propagates from the apex to the base of the posterior wall, and then from the base to the apex of the septum, with a propagation speed of 3-9 m/s. The latter occurs at the end of the first heart sound at the apical side and propagates to the base side with a speed of 0.6 m/s. These physiological findings, unlike the widely accepted myocardial excitation process, have potential for accurate assessment of myocardial tissue damage in coronary disease and cardiomyopathy.

[u'Does human imitate successful behaviors immediately?', ['Zhao-Jin Xu', 'Lian-Zhong Zhang'], u'2010-05-21', u'The emergence and abundance of cooperation in animal and human societies is a challenging puzzle to evolutionary biology. Over the past decades, various mechanisms have been suggested which are capable of supporting cooperation. Imitation dynamics, however, are the most representative microscopic rules of human behaviors on studying these mechanisms. Their standard procedure is to choose the agent to imitate at random from the population. In the spatial version this means a random agent from the neighborhood. Hence, imitation rules do not include the possibility to explore the available strategies, and then they have the possibility to reach a homogeneous state rapidly when the population size is small. To prevent evolution stopping, theorists allow for random mutations in addition to the imitation dynamics. Consequently, if the microscopic rules involve both imitation and mutation, the frequency of agents switching to the more successful strategy must be higher than that of them transiting to the same target strategy via mutation dynamics. Here we show experimentally that the frequency of switching to successful strategy approximates to that of mutating to the same strategy. This suggests that imitation might play an insignificant role on the behaviors of human decision making. In addition, our experiments show that the probabilities of agents mutating to different target strategies are significantly distinct. The actual mutation theories cannot give us an appropriate explanation to the experimental results. Hence, we argue that the mutation dynamics might have evolved for other reasons.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/4480/version/1', [u'Evolutionary Biology'], [u'School of Science, Tianjin University of Technology', u'School of Phycics, Nankai University']]

However, menstrual cycle synchronisation, puberty onset in young pre-pubertal girls exposed to their stepfather, and consanguinity avoidance suggest a function in the physiological regulation of sexual and reproductive behaviour in humans. These phenomena are related to activation of the limbic system by pheromones. On the basis of sexually dimorphic activation of brain hypothalamic areas and the control of body temperature via the hypothalamus, our hypothesis is that human sexual pheromones can induce thermal effects that can be revealed by high-resolution thermal infrared imaging. Here we show that in women, male sexual pheromones induce thermal effects that are linked to the ovarian cycle.

Introns are classified in two main groups (I and II) according to their RNA secondary structure involved in the intron self-splicing mechanism (ref. 5,6). Most of the group I introns carry a \u201cHoming Endonuclease Gene\u201d (ref. 7-9) encoding a DNA endonuclease acting in the transfer and site specific integration \u201choming\u201d) and allowing the intron spreading and gain after lateral transfer even between species from different kingdoms (ref. 10,11). Opposite to this \u201clate intron\u201d paradigm, the \u201cearly intron\u201d theory indicates that introns, which would have been abundant in the ancestral genes, would mainly evolve by loss (ref. 12,13).Here we report the sequence of the cox1 gene of the button mushroom Agaricus bisporus, the most worldwide cultivated mushroom. This gene is both the longest mitochondrial gene (29,902 nt) and the largest Group I intron reservoir reported to date.

Viruses, however, are the most abundant life forms, and their exclusion from mainstream biology and the Tree of Life (TOL) is a major paradox in biology. This article presents a broad, unifying scenario on the origin and evolution of cellular and viral domains that challenges the conventional views about the history of life and supports a TOL that includes viruses. Co-evolution of viruses and their host cells has led to some of the most remarkable developments and transitions in the evolution of life, including the origin of non-coding DNA as a genomic protective device against viral insertion damage. However, one of the major fundamental evolutionary developments driven by viruses was probably the origin of cellular domains \u2013 Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya \u2013 from the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA) lineage, by evolving anti-fusion mechanisms. Consistent with a novel fusion/fission model for the population mode of evolution of LUCA, this paper presents a \u201ccell-like world\u201d model for the origin of life. According to this model the evolution of coupled replication, transcription and translation system (RT&T) occurred within non-living cell-like compartments (CCs). In this model, the ancestral ribosome originated as template-based RNA synthesizing machinery. The origin of the cellular genome as a centralized unit for storage and replication of genetic information within the CCs facilitated the evolution of the ancestral ribosome into a powerful translation machinery \u2013 the modern ribosome. After several hundred millions of years of providing an enclosed environment and fusion/fission based exchanges necessary for the population mode of evolution of the basic metabolism and the RT&T, the CCs evolved into the first living entities on earth \u2013 the LUCA lineage. The paper concludes with a proposal for a TOL that integrates the co-evolution of cellular and viral domains. This is one of a series of three articles that present a unifying scenario on the origin and evolution of viral and cellular domains, including the origin of life, which has significant t bio-medical implications and could lead to a significant paradigm shift in biology.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/3888/version/1', [u'Genetics & Genomics', u'Immunology', u'Microbiology', u'Evolutionary Biology'], [u'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA 30333']]
[u'Endogenous Viral Etiology of Prion Diseases', ['Claudiu I. Bandea'], u'2009-10-21', u'Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), or prion diseases, are a group of incurable neurodegenerative disorders, including Kuru and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, \u201cmad cow\u201d disease in cattle, and scrapie in sheep. This paper presents structural, genetic, and evolutionary evidence supporting an endogenous TSE virus model that integrates the three major traditional views on the nature of TSE pathogens, the conventional virus view, the prion hypothesis, and the virino concept, into a novel conceptual and evolutionary framework. According to this model, the TSE pathogens are symbiotic endogenous viruses that inadvertently produce transmissible viral particles that lack the viral genome and are composed primarily of the viral prion protein (PrP). Production of defective viral particles that contain a partial genome or lack the viral genome entirely is a relatively common event in the life cycle of many viruses. Similar to the normal viral particles, which contain a genome, these defective viral particles can be transmitted to new host cells. Obviously, in the absence of viral genome, these protein-only viral particles cannot establish a productive infection. However, if these viral particles enter a host cell that carries the parental or a related virus and induce the production of similar protein-only particles, then they would appear as self-replicating, protein-only infectious pathogens if mistakenly taken out from the context of the viral life cycle. This misconception, which is rooted into the current dogma of viruses as viral particles, led to the development of the prion theory. The endogenous TSE virus model is consistent with the TSE data and offers solutions to many enigmatic features associated with TSE, including the function of PrP that, despite more than two decades of TSE research conducted primarily within the framework of the prion hypothesis, is still not known. According to the TSE endogenous virus model, PrP is the protein of an endogenous virus that has co-evolved with their vertebrate hosts by providing a protective function against pathogenic viruses. The evidence for the endogenous TSE virus model and for the antiviral protective function of PrP is strong, and they are fully open to additional experimental testing. The endogenous virus model opens the TSE research field to new interpretations and directions, both in basic research and in associated biomedical and public health fields, and could lead to development of new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/3887/version/1', [u'Microbiology', u'Neuroscience', u'Evolutionary Biology'], [u'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA 30333']]
[u'The Origin and Evolution of Viruses as Molecular Organisms', ['Claudiu I. Bandea'], u'2009-10-21', u'Viruses are the most abundant life forms and the repertoire of viral genes is greater than that of cellular genes. It is also evident that viruses have played a major role in driving cellular evolution, and yet, viruses are not part of mainstream biology, nor are they included in the Tree of Life. A reason for this major paradox in biology is the misleading dogma of viruses as viral particles and their enigmatic evolutionary origin. This article presents an alternative view about the nature of viruses based on their properties during the intracellular stage of their life cycle, when viruses express features comparable to those of many parasitic cellular species. Supporting this view about the nature of viruses is a novel hypothetical evolutionary model for their origin from parasitic cellular species that fused with their host cells. By losing their membrane and cellular structure within the host cell, these new types of parasitic species gained full access to precursors for the synthesis of their specific molecules and to the host\u2019s information processing machineries, such as translation, which created unique parasitic and evolutionary opportunities. To identify viruses during their intracellular stage of their life cycle, in which their specific molecules are free or dispersed within the host cell, this paper introduces the concept of \u201cmolecular structure\u201d and labels viruses as \u201cmolecular organisms.\u201d Among the extant viruses, the life cycle of poxviruses and other complex viruses that fuse with their host cells provides compelling evidence for the fusion model. One of the most remarkable implications of fusion model is that new viral lineages originated from parasitic cellular species throughout the history of life, and that this process might still be active. Surprisingly, it appears that several parasitic cellular species are currently evolving into molecular organisms. More remarkably though, according to this model, several parasites that are currently classified as cellular organisms are in fact genuine molecular organisms. The current evidence for the fusion hypothesis is strong and it is fully testable using both experimental and phylogenetic approaches. The academic and research implications of this model, which supports the inclusion of viruses in the Tree of Life, are highly significant. Some of these implications are discussed in more detail in two other articles of this series, which presents a unifying model for the origin and evolution of cellular and viral domains, including the origin of life.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/3886/version/1', [u'Genetics & Genomics', u'Microbiology', u'Evolutionary Biology'], [u'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA 30333']]

Careful application of these methods would enable the collection of better-quality serological data on a greater number of circulating influenza viruses than is currently possible, and improve the ability to identify potential epidemic/pandemic viruses before they become widespread.

In this paper we examine the fit between morphological and molecular data in the systematic revision of Paroaria, a group of conspicuous songbirds endemic to South America. We delimited species based on examination of > 600 specimens, and developed distance-gap, and distance- and character-based coalescent simulations to test species limits with molecular data. The morphological and molecular data collected were then analyzed using parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian phylogenetics. The simulations were better at evaluating the new species limits than using genetic distances. Species diversity within Paroaria had been underestimated by 60%, and the revised genus comprises eight species. Phylogenetic analyses consistently recovered a congruent topology for the most recently derived species in the genus, but the most basal divergences were not resolved with these data.

[u'Ustilago and the accidental domestication of maize', ['Juan Pablo Martinez-Soriano', 'Katia Avina-Padilla'], u'2009-05-13', u'Maize is the essential crop of the Americas. Maize appeared suddenly about 8,500 years ago as domesticated teosinte; however, there is no evidence (genetical, archaeological, linguistic or ethnobotanical) able to support a gradual transformation from the teosinte ear into the corn ear. Teosinte has never been cultivated by Americans, nor did they ever attempt to domesticate it. Its grains were not used as food, making unrealistic the assumption that prehispanics created something edible from seeds that were not so. Plant domestication is a slow process in almost every known crop but maize evolution might not be the case. Teosinte has a brittle cob, whereas maize forms solid ones that do not release their seeds 2. The latter are soft, while in teosinte they are enclosed in hard inedible cases. Why would the prehispanic natives even think of modifying those hard seeds, if they were not used as food in the first place?. The switch from teosinte to maize were due to important mutations, occurring in a relatively short period so that natives immediately noticed if they were well aware of the importance of teosinte (or its parasites) and rescued the resultant newborn maize.Teosinte-maize hybrids were highly susceptible to the fungus Ustilago maydis (known in Mexico as huitlacoche) under natural conditions. Consequently, this parasite was found to infect every part of the hybrid plant.Huitlacoche is well known as a food delicacy and it has been important to Mexicans since prehispanic times and it might have been very likely used as food taken from infected teosinte at the same time it was changing into maize. Ustilago maydis probably played a vital role on the domestication process of maize, since the change from teosinte to maize was noticed by humans, who then rescued it from nature', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/3240/version/1', [u'Plant Biology', u'Evolutionary Biology'], [u'CINVESTAV Guanajuato, Biotecnologia y Bioquimica, Mexico']]

Tomato genotypes exhibited seed abortion where in only some proportion of ovules developed into matured seeds. Seed abortion in tomato cultivars would increase the cost of hybrid seed production. In this study, we have analyzed 19 genotypes for number of ovules, seed set and seed abortion. Tomato genotypes differed significantly for number of ovules per ovary, seed set per fruit and per cent seed abortion. The ovules, matured seeds and seed abortion ranged from 52 to 412 per ovary; 50.90 to 240.76 per fruit and 6.06 to 24.44 per cent respectively.

In evolutionary game theory, a pair is randomly picked from population, and play a prisoner\u2019s dilemma game. Here we also show the finiteness encourages cooperation but use different approach: in spite of random-pick, individuals join and leave a spot or territory with a limited capacity to form a pair and play prisoner\u2019s dilemma game during their stay in the spot. We use a simple finite-state continuous-time Markov chain to analyze the dynamics in the spot and find that, given large cooperation benefit, just leaving together from the spot is enough for cooperation to be emerged.

From about 18 months of age children will routinely copy arbitrary and unnecessary actions. This puzzling behaviour is called &apos;over-imitation&apos;. By documenting similarities exhibited by children from a large, industrialised city and children from remote Bushman communities in southern Africa, we provide here the first indication that over-imitation is a universal human trait.

[u'A condition of cooperation. Games on network', ['Tomohiko Konno'], u'2009-04-06', u'Natural selection is often regarded as a result of severe competition. Defect seems beneficial for a single individual in many cases.However, cooperation is observed in many levels of biological systems ranging from single cells to animals, including human society. We have yet known that in unstructured populations, evolution favors defectors over cooperators. On the other hand, there have been much interest on evolutionary games1,2 on structured population and on graphs3-16. Structures of biological systems and societies of animals can be taken as networks. They discover that network structures determine results of the games. Together with the recent interest of complex networks17,18, many researchers investigate real network structures. Recently even economists study firms&apos; transactions structure19. Seminal work11 derives the condition of favoring cooperation for evolutionary games on networks, that is, benefit divided by cost, b/c, exceeds average degree, (k). Although this condition has been believed so far20, we find the condition is b/c (knm) instead. knm is the mean nearest neighbor degree. Our condition enables us to compare how network structure enhances cooperation across different kinds of networks. Regular network favors most, scale free network least. On ideal scale free networks, cooperation is unfeasible. We could say that (k) is the degree of itself, while knm is that of others. One of the most interesting points in network theory is that results depend not only on itself but also on others.

[u'Exaptation and emergence as mechanisms to cross fitness valleys during evolution: an example using simulated homing behaviour', ['Richard Stafford'], u'2008-08-12', u'Evolution is often considered a gradual hill climbing process, slowly increasing the fitness of organisms. I investigate the evolution of homing behaviour in simulated intertidal limpets. In order to evolve path integration as a homing mechanism, a temporary reduction in an organism\u2019s fitness is required \u2013 since high developmental costs occur before a successful homing strategy evolves. Simple hill-climbing algorithms, therefore, only rarely result in the evolution of a functional homing behaviour. The inclusion of a second behaviour (trail-following) greatly increases the frequency of success of evolution of a path integration strategy. Initially an emergent homing behaviour is formed combining path integration with trail following. This also demonstrates evolution through exaptation, since the original role of trail following is likely to be unrelated to homing. Analysis of the fitness landscapes of homing in the presence of trail-following behaviour shows a high variability of fitness, which results in the formation of \u2018stepping-stones\u2019 of high fitness across fitness valleys.

[u'Why are women smaller than men? When anthropology meets evolutionary biology', ['Priscille Touraille', 'Pierre-Henri Gouyon'], u'2008-04-25', u'There are large variations of size among humans but in all populations, men are larger on average than women. For most biologists this fact can be easily explained by the same processes that explain the size dimorphism in large mammals in general and in apes in particular. Due to fights between males for the possession of females, sexual selection has favoured bigger males. Indeed, this factor certainly explains why males are selected for being large but lets aside the question of selection on the female side. Actually, it has been shown that larger females are also favoured by natural selection. This is particularly relevant for women because their probability of dying when giving birth is then reduced. In this paper, the common view that size dimorphism in humans results from the fact that the advantage of being big is stronger for men than for women is challenged by another hypothesis, namely that the difference results from a difference of cost rather than from a difference of benefits. The cost of being big would be higher in women simply because, under gender hierarchical regimes found in all cultures, men are allocated the best food.

[u'Idiosyncratic evolution of conserved eukaryote proteins that are similar in sequence to archaeal or bacterial proteins', ['Roy J.

Highly conserved eukaryotic proteins are often strikingly similar in sequence to archaeal and bacterial proteins. Yet in many cases similarity to archaeal proteins is not correlated to the similarity to bacterial proteins. In these comparisons there are hundreds of eukaryote proteins that match well archeal proteins, but do not match recognizably to bacterial proteins, while thousands of proteins match well to bacterial proteins but not recognizably to archeal proteins. Forty percent of the 21,440 human proteins that significantly match prokaryote proteins are in this extreme idiosyncratic category. These relationships have been preserved over billions of years since the last common ancestor or sharing of protein genes between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. For each of the 21,440 members of this set of human proteins (that make significant matches to any of the 1.8 million proteins in this set of prokaryote species protein libraries) it is certain that each protein has important functions both in  prokaryotes and eukaryotes and the precursor proteins have been important in the precursor species of both. That is the only explanation for the preservation of amino acid sequence similarity for the billions of years since the last common ancestor or period of sharing of proteins. Comparisons were made between the proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana  and Saccharomyces cerevisiae to the proteins of the 571 prokaryote species.

[u'Genetic similarity promotes evolution of cooperation under lethal intergroup competition', ['Oleg Smirnov', 'John Orbell'], u'2008-03-21', u'Altruism (helping others at a cost to oneself) may evolve via group selection if the cost of altruism to the individual is compensated for by growth differences among groups when (1) there is high genetic variation among members of different groups; (2) more altruistic groups grow faster and (3) between-group migration is low. Nevertheless, group selection may not fully explain the actual evolution of helping behaviour if between-group migration was sufficiently common to have reduced between-group genetic variance. Lethal intergroup competition, which amplifies such growth differences between groups, appears to have been frequent in humans\u2019; ancestral environments and could bear importantly on the evolution of altruism. Here we show that between-group migration and resulting genetic similarity can promote the evolution of costly helping behavior in the context of lethal intergroup conflict, albeit by selection at the individual level and not by group selection.

This relationship is thought to have depended upon the transfer of both genetic information and catalytic function in living systems. We investigated whether ribozymes could transfer genetic information and catalytic function at the chemical level. We identified a family of peptides encoded by ribozymes: 13-residue peptide encoded by the hammerhead ribozyme, a 19-residue peptide encoded by the genomic hepatitis delta virus (HDV+) ribozyme, a 25-residue peptide encoded by the antigenomic HDV (HDV-) ribozyme, a 15-residue peptide encoded by the smallest trans-acting genomic HDV (SHDV) ribozyme, and a 22-residue peptide encoded by an open reading frame (ORF) of RNase P. We show that all these peptides possess the ability to cleave single-stranded RNA substrates. Furthermore, we expressed a 56-residue peptide encoded by an intact ORF (616-783) of the VS ribozyme, and found that it has single-stranded RNA cleavage activity as well.

The polygalacturonase (PG) (EC3.2.1.15) gene family is one of the largest gene families in plants. PG is a pectin-digesting enzyme with a glycoside hydrolase 28 domain. It is involved in numerous plant developmental processes. The evolutionary processes accounting for the functional divergence and the specialized functions of PGs in land plants are unclear. Here, phylogenetic and gene structure analysis of PG genes in algae and land plants revealed that land plant PG genes resulted from differential intron gain and loss, with the latter event predominating. PG genes in land plants contained 15 homologous intron blocks and 13 novel intron blocks. Intron position and phase were not conserved between PGs of algae and land plants but conserved among PG genes of land plants from moss to vascular plants, indicating that the current introns in the PGs in land plants appeared after the split between unicellular algae and multicelluar land plants. These findings demonstrate that the functional divergence and differentiation of PGs in land plants is attributable to intronic loss.

As a RecA phenotype increases genetic stability and may contribute restricting the ongoing evolution of the various BCG substrains, we aimed to inactivate recA by allelic replacement in BCG vaccine strains representing different phylogenetic lineages (Pasteur, Frappier, Denmark, Russia). Homologous gene replacement was successful in three out of four strains. However, only illegitimate recombination was observed in BCG substrain Russia. Sequence analyses of recA revealed that a single nucleotide insertion in the 5\u2019 part of recA led to a translational frameshift with an early stop codon making BCG Russia a natural recA mutant. At the protein level BCG Russia failed to express RecA. According to phylogenetic analyses BCG Russia is an ancient vaccine strain most closely related to the parental M. bovis.

Game theoretical solutions to stabilize cooperation rely on reciprocity and reputation in iterated games[4-5]. One of the basic requirements for reciprocity or reputation building is that the strategies of players and the resulting payoffs should be open at the end of every interaction. For games in which the strategies and payoffs remain hidden, these stabilizing factors are unlikely to work. We examine the evolution of cooperation for hidden-strategy games using human mating game as an example.  Here faithful parenting can be considered as cooperation and extra-pair mating (EPM) or cuckoldry as defection. Cuckoldry may get exposed only occasionally and the genetic benefits of cuckoldry also remain hidden from the players. Along with mate guarding, social policing is enabled in humans by language and gossiping. However, social policing can be invaded by second order free riders. We suggest that opportunistic blackmailing, which is unique to hidden strategy games can act as a keystone strategy in stabilizing co-operation. This can counteract free riding and stabilize policing. A game theoretical model results into a rock \u2013 paper \u2013 scissor (R-P-S) like situation with no evolutionary stable strategy (ESS). Simulations result into a stable or stably oscillating polymorphism. Obligate monogamy is an essential trait in the co-existence.

Furthermore, it lacks an accepted procedure to select which genetic markers needs to be investigated, to evaluate their specific role and, as consequence, to define a personalized diet.

Understanding the cellular and molecular determinants of sociability may reveal therapeutic approaches to treat individuals with these disorders and improve their quality of life. Previous experiments from our laboratory have identified selective mRNA and protein expression of a nonselective cation channel known as the canonical transient receptor potential channel 4 (TRPC4s) in brain regions implicated in emotional regulation and anxiety. TRPC4 is highly expressed in the corticolimbic regions of the mammalian brain. We hypothesized that robust corticolimbic expression of TRPC4 may regulate the brain\u2019s response to emotion and anxiety resulting in changes in social interaction. Here we test trpc4 gene knockout rats in a model of social anxiety/interaction. We found that the Trpc4 knockout animals spent significantly less time exploring a juvenile intruder rat compared to their wild-type counterparts and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Furthermore, Trpc4 wild-type (Fisher 344) rats explored the juvenile significantly less than the SD rats. These findings indicate that the trpc4 gene plays a role in modulating cellular excitability in specific regions of the brain associated sociality and/or anxiety.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/6367/version/1', [u'Genetics & Genomics', u'Neuroscience'], [u'Center for Neuroscience, Department of Neuroscience, Institute for Behavioral Genetics, University of Colorado at Boulder, Boulder Colorado 80303, USA', u'Transposagen Biopharmaceuticals, Inc Lexington, KY 40506']]

[u'A Possible Solution to the Etiological Paradox that Ties Anti-Social Personality Disorder to Major Depression', ['Alvaro Machado Dias'], u'2011-08-30', u'Abstract. Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) is a pervasive condition among youngsters around the globe, which has particular pungency in countries where the socioeconomic context favors delinquency. Several behavioral genetics studies have linked the disorder to the presence of copies of a polymorphic variation of the MAO-A gene that leads to enzymatic hypofunction.  An emerging tendency in this literature is to also associate it to the presence of short variations of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism, which is well-known for its possible role in the vulnerability to major depression of individuals that were exposed to early-life stress. The current paper argues that the association of these findings introduce a theoretical problem that is not trivial (\u201can apparent paradox\u201d), and further proposes a solution to it.

After reaching concentration levels of 10 000/ml of the cells, the cultures were treated with 60 ng/ml and 300 ng/ml doses of paclitaxel. The concentrations were calculated in relation to therapeutic doses of paclitaxel, applied in polytherapy in patients with breast cancer.

[u'Widespread Mitochondrial Disease in North American Bison', ['Thomas H. Pringle'], u'2011-02-07', u'North American bison have rebounded from near-extinction in the nineteenth century but from such small inbred founding populations that once-rare deleterious nuclear gene alleles and mitochondrial haplotypes are now at high frequencies. The initial bottleneck was compounded by decades of unnatural selection affecting bison conservation genomics and undercutting restoration initiatives. The genomics era began in late 2010 for bison and sister species yak with the release of 102 whole mitochondrial genomes, displacing earlier control region and microsatellite data not extending to coding regions. This allows detection of both sporadic and sub-clade level mutations in mitochondrially encoded proteins and tRNAs by comparative genomics methods: deleterious mutations in both cytochrome b (V98A) and ATP6 (I60N) occur within a single common bison haplotype. Since similar mutations in human and dog cause clinical impairment of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, these bison are predicted to be significantly impaired in aerobic capacity, disrupting highly evolved cold tolerance, winter feeding behaviors, escape from predators and competition for breeding. Because Yellowstone National Park bison are subjected to genetically uninformed culls and surplus animals used to seed new conservation herds, mutational status has significant implications. Continuing take of the remaining bison with wildtype mitochondria may recapitulate errors of nineteenth century bison stewardship bringing bison conservation to the point of no return.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/5645/version/1', [u'Genetics & Genomics'], [u'Sperling Foundation']]

The concept was experimentally proven by sequencing a synthetic mixture of genomic DNA samples from a child and her mother, whose whole-genome haplotypes (defined by ~800,000 SNPs), together with those of the father, were previously determined. Light sequencing (0.25x) of such sample containing ~16% child\u2019s DNA enabled the inheritance of parental haplotypes to be correctly resolved over most part of the genome, and partially resolved when prior knowledge of paternal whole-genome haplotypes is absent.

There are 3 clinical types of SMA; type I, type II and type III. Type I SMA is the most severe type and only a small amount of FL-SMN protein is present in these individuals. We postulated that the difference in the promoter region of SMN2 gene produces the different level of FL-SMN protein. To verify this hypothesis, the DNA samples of 69 SMA patients who were referred to the Human Genome Center, USM were extracted from their blood. The SMN1 deletion analysis was performed, followed by the SMN2 copy no. analysis and NAIP deletion analysis to remove any clinical bias as NAIP gene deletion and SMN2 copy number have been reported to be associated with SMA disease severity. Only 10 SMA patients from different clinical types (type I=2, type II=3, type III=5) with homozygous deletion of the SMN1 and 2 copies of the SMN2 and deletion in NAIP were finally recruited. Primers were designed for the amplification of the SMN2 promoter region. Bioinformatics analysis was performed to identify the crucial transcription factor binding sites within the reported ~4.6 kb promoter region. As the core promoter region is still unknown (unreported), we analyzed 15 ORFs and 24 nested ORFs with 15 TATA boxes reflecting the diverse functional integrity of this region. The promoter prediction and core promoter prediction was also performed. Based on the bioinformatics analysis and the designed primers, PCR amplification was done for different regions in the promoter and the PCR products were subjected to direct DNA sequencing. The results were analyzed by Vector NTI suite 9, ClustalX and Gene Doc softwares. The molecular analysis confirmed the absence of any mutation in the promoter region of the SMN2 gene between normal healthy individuals (total 2) and SMA patients. In 4 patients and 1 normal healthy individual the CA repeats were found to be increased which we think cause no effect in disease progression and severity. In conclusion, there was no mutation found in the promoter region of the SMN2 gene among the SMA patients of different clinical types and normal controls.

Some may be derived from Herpes simplex and 68 other virus proteins matching an immunogenic and fibrillogenic VGGVV A\u03b2 sequence.Many other viral, microbial and allergenic proteins (particularly from dust mites) align with A\u03b2 as do proteins from C.Neoformans which has been associated with a rare but curable form of the disorder. Immune-related proteins are present in amyloid plaques and the complement membrane attack complex in neurones in Alzheimer\u2019s disease brains. Alzheimer\u2019s disease may thus be an autoimmune disorder triggered by pathogenic antigens homologous to A\u03b2, whose antibodies target and kill A\u03b2 containing neurones, via immune activation and complement-related lysis. This scenario explains many epidemiological observations in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, which is more common in women and Afro-Americans, as is HSV-2 seroprevalence; related to the number of pregnancies (exposure to childhood infections) and less severe in nuns (low exposure to sexually transmitted diseases). Atopy and autoimmune disorders are common in Alzheimer\u2019s disease in accord with allergen homology to A\u03b2, and anti-inflammatory agents reduce Alzheimer\u2019s disease risk. Cancer-causing, and plant viruses from Mediterranean diet components align with the A\u03b2 sequence targeted by catalytic autoantibodies, perhaps explaining the inverse association of diet and cancer with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. As a papillomavirus vaccine already exists, it may have a role to play in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. This scenario is also relevant to familial Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Mutant forms of APP717 and the Swedish mutant convert the surrounding peptide to matches with commensal bacteria (E.Coli, E. Faecalis, P.Gingivalis) and to viruses with very high seroprevalence (HHV-6, norovirus, influenza and the common cold).

[u"Extensive Viral mimicry of human proteins in AIDS, autoimmune disorders, late-onset and familial Alzheimer's disease and other genetic diseases", ['Christopher J. Carter'], u'2010-06-27', u'Peptide stretches within HIV-1 proteins display homology to over 50 components from all compartments of the human immune defence network. The homologous peptides are in most cases immunogenic, suggesting that antibodies to HIV-1 proteins could mount an autoimmune attack against multiple components of the immune system itself. HIV-1 proteins are also homologous to autoantigens in Alzheimer&apos;s disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, multiple sclerosis, Myasthenia Gravis, Pemphigus Vulgaris, Sjogrens syndrome and systemic Lupus Erythematosus, all of which have been associated with HIV-1 infection. This mimicry suggests that HIV-1/AIDS has a major autoimmune component and that HIV-1 antibodies could selectively target the immune system and autoantigens in other autoimmune disorders. This could radically change our conception of how HIV-1 acts, and perhaps lead to novel therapeutic strategies, which, counter intuitively might even involve the use of immunosuppressants in the early stages of the disease. Autoantigens from the human autoimmune diseases mentioned above also align with peptides from other viruses implicated as risk factors in each disease. Mutant peptides from Huntington&apos;s disease and other polyglutamine disorders, and from cystic fibrosis also align with common viruses.

Viral mimicry related autoimmunity may thus play a role in many autoimmune and even human genetic disorders.

[u'The E3 ubiquitin ligase c-IAP1 regulates PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation: Linking the TNF-\u03b1 pathway to cholesterol uptake', ['Weiming Xu', 'Lizhi Liu'], u'2010-06-21', u'Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), in addition to LDLR (low-density lipoprotein receptor) and APOB (apolipoprotein B), is one of three loci implicated in autosomal dominant hypercholesterolaemia (ADH)1. A number of PCSK9 gain-of-function mutations and loss-of-function mutations have been identified from families afflicted with ADH with hypercholesterolaemia or hypocholesterolaemia, respectively1-4. In humans, the main function of PCSK9 appears to be the post-transcriptional regulation of the number of cell-surface LDL receptors5-7. To date, only LDLR and its closest family members VLDLR and ApoER2 have been shown to bind with PCSK98,9. To find new binding partners for PCSK9, we used a shotgun proteomic method to analyse the protein complex pulled down by immunoprecipitation against FLAG-tagged PCSK9 protein. Among 22 potential novel binding proteins identified, we found that the cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 (c-IAP110) and the TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF211) complex are regulated differently in different dominant PCSK9 mutations that occur naturally. Further immunoprecipitation analysis showed that c-IAP1 is a direct binding partner for PCSK9. One of the \u201cgain-of-function\u201d mutants, PCSK9-S127R, which has impaired autocatalytic activity, is defective in binding to c-IAP1. The other dominant mutation, PCSK9-D374Y12, which is 10-fold more potent in degrading the LDLR protein than wild-type PCSK9, can be significantly ubiquitinated by c-IAP1 in vitro. The ubiquitinated PCSK9-D374Y is unable to degrade LDLR, which is its main cause of hypercholesterolaemia in patients. These results indicate that there is a novel cholesterol uptake regulation pathway linking PCSK9/LDLR to the E3 ubiquitin ligase c-IAP1 in a TNF-\u03b1 response pathway. This highlights the possibility of developing new treatments for human cardiovascular diseases through ubiquitin ligase-mediated ubiquitination of target proteins in cholesterol metabolism.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/4554/version/1', [u'Genetics & Genomics', u'Molecular Cell Biology'], [u'The University of Sheffield, Molecular Biology and Biotechnology']]

We assessed the addition of risk information from a panel of BCa-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on risk stratification offered by the Gail Model.Methods: We selected 7 validated SNPs from the literature and genotyped them among white women in a nested case-control study within the Women\u2019s Health Initiative Clinical Trial.  To model SNP risk, previously published odds ratios were combined multiplicatively.  To produce a combined clinical/genetic risk, Gail Model risk estimates were multiplied by combined SNP odds ratios.  We assessed classification performance using reclassification tables and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results: The SNP risk score was well calibrated and nearly independent of Gail risk, and the combined predictor was more predictive than either Gail risk or SNP risk alone.  In ROC curve analysis, the combined score had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.594 compared to 0.557 for Gail risk alone.  For reclassification with 5-year risk thresholds at 1.5% and 2%, the net reclassification index (NRI) was 0.085 (Z = 4.3, P = 1.0\xd710-5).  Focusing on women with Gail 5-year risk of 1.5-2% results in an NRI of 0.195 (Z = 3.8, P = 8.6\xd710\u22125).Conclusions: Combining clinical risk factors and validated common genetic risk factors results in improvement in classification of BCa risks in white, postmenopausal women.

Cardiovascular involvement represents a well-known complication and the primary cause of mortality, both in transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia major (\u03b2-TM) and in transfusion-independent beta thalassemia intermedia (\u03b2-TI). In \u03b2-TM, heart iron overload is considered the main cause of this complication. This is likely due to poor adherence to iron-chelating therapy, resulting in the inability of the body to efficiently remove iron excess derived from transfused red blood cell breakdown. Different clinical pictures may instead be evoked in cardiovascular involvement occurring in \u03b2-TI; however, until now, no factor has emerged as the major one responsible for these complications. Design and Methods. In the present study, iron status, and lipid profiles in serum, as well as lipid content in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were evaluated in 70 adult \u03b2-TM and in 22 adult \u03b2-TI patients. Ninety-two age-matched blood donors, free from any form of thalassemia, were utilized as controls. The mRNA levels of genes involved in the regulation of iron metabolism, such as interleukine 1 alfa (IL1\u03b1), tumor necrosis factor alfa (TNF\u03b1), as well as those involved in cholesterol homeostasis, such as acetyl-coenzymeA: cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT-1), neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase (nCEH), and ATP binding cassette-A (ABCA1), were also evaluated in PBMCs from the above subjects.Results. In \u03b2-TI patients, serum iron, transferrin saturation and erythropoietin levels were higher, while transferrin and hepcidin were lower, compared to both \u03b2-TM and controls. Hepcidin and IL\u03b1 mRNA levels were found to be reduced in \u03b2-TI-PBMCs, while those of TNF\u03b1 were increased. A reduction in total and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (TC and HDL-C) in serum, and an accumulation of neutral lipids (NL), coupled with increased mRNA levels of ACAT-1 and decreased nCEH in PBMCs were also observed in \u03b2-TI. Conclusions. Since most of the parameters found to be altered in \u03b2-TI patients have a key role in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis, we suggest that cardiovascular complications in these patients may be, at least partially, dependent on the occurrence of premature atherosclerotic lesions.

In this novel mode of inheritance, transcriptomic alteration induced by the neuroactive drug pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) has been found to leak to future generations. Here, the available microarray gene expression data pertaining to CNS and/or testis of exposed F0 and the resulting F1 and F2 generations has been pooled and analyzed in an unbiased manner at four levels, namely, biological processes and pathways, protein interactome networks, miRNA-targets, and microarray expression profile similarities. Enrichment for processes related to translation, energy metabolism, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, secretion, central nervous system development, germ cell development, gamete generation, wing development, nutrition etc. was observed. Also, ribosome, oxidative phosphorylation and, to a lesser extent, wingless signaling pathway showed overrepresentation. In the proteomic interactome map, the cell cycle gene Ras85D exhibited overinteraction. In miRNA-target network, the fly transgenerational genes showed overrepresentation of mir-315 targets. Transcriptomic matching revealed overlap of transgenerational set with genes related to epigenetic drug treatment, stem cells, Myc targets and miRNA targets. Many of the findings were consistent with the existing epigenetic evidence in complex mammalian traits. Converging evidence suggests that ribosomal RNA and proteins may serve as candidate biomarkers of transgenerational environmental effect. A compelling systems biology frame-work integrative of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance is suggested. Nutrient, circulating peptide hormone, Myc, Wnt, and stem cell signaling pathways constitute the frame-work.

The CHRM2 vagal vigour hypothesis posits that variation at rs8191992 alters the binding site for a brain-expressed microRNA (hsa-mir-383) thereby changing expression of brain M2 muscarinic receptors to cause pleiotropic effects on cognition and vagus nerve signalling which then affects health via the vagal cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. This may help explain ethnic health differences, including the Hispanic Health Paradox, since ethnic differences in rs8191992 allele frequencies correspond to ethnic differences in systemic inflammation and mortality.

Reduced expression of this gene and the protein it encodes, dysbindin-1, has been reported in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of schizophrenia cases. It has not been established, however, if all dysbindin-1 isoforms are reduced in the DLPFC or if the reduction is associated with reduced DTNBP1 gene expression. Using Western blotting of whole-tissue lysates of the DLPFC with antibodies differentially sensitive to the three major isoforms of this protein (dysbindin-1A, -1B, and -1C), we found no significant differences between our schizophrenia cases and matched controls in dysbindin-1A or -1B, but did find a mean 46% reduction in dysbindin-1C in 71% of 28 case-control pairs (p = 0.022). This occurred in the absence of the one DTNBP1 risk haplotype for schizophrenia reported in the US and without alteration in levels of dysbindin-1C transcripts. Conversely, the absence of changes in the dysbindin-1A and -1B isoforms was accompanied by increased levels of their transcripts. We thus found no correspondence between alterations in dysbindin-1 gene and protein expression, the latter of which might be due to posttranslational modifications such as ubiquitination. Reduced DLPFC dysbindin-1C in schizophrenia probably occurs in PSDs, where we find dysbindin-1C to be heavily concentrated in the human brain. Given known postsynaptic effects of dysbindin-1 reductions in the rodent homolog of the prefrontal cortex, these findings suggest that reduced dysbindin-1C in the DLPFC may contribute to cognitive deficits of schizophrenia by promoting NMDA receptor hypofunction.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/2779/version/1', [u'Genetics & Genomics', u'Molecular Cell Biology', u'Neuroscience'], [u'University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA', u'Cardiff University, UK']]

A general model has been proposed for heterochromatin formation and epigenetic gene silencing in different species that implies an essential role for HP1. According to the model, histone methyltransferase enzymes (HMTases) methylate the histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3-MeK9), creating selective binding sites for itself and the chromodomain of HP15. This complex is thought to form a higher order chromatin state that represses gene activity. It has also been found that HP1 plays a role in telomere capping6. Surprisingly, recent data have suggested an association of HP1 in gene activity7-10 but the nature of this interaction is still completely obscure. Here we show, that HP1 is required for positive regulation of more than one hundred euchromatic genes by its association with the corresponding RNA transcripts and by its interaction with the well known proteins DDP111, HRB87F12 and PEP13, which belong to different classes of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) involved in RNA processing . We also found that all these hnRNP proteins also bind heterochromatin and are dominant suppressors of position effect variegation. Our data together, show novel and unexpected functions for HP1 and hnRNPs proteins. All these proteins are in fact involved in both RNA transcript processing and in heterochromatin formation.

Thus, while up-regulated levels of D-aspartate increased LTP and spatial memory in four-month old adult mice, the prolonged deregulation of this molecule in thirteen-month old animals induced a substantial acceleration of age-dependent decay of synaptic plasticity and cognitive functions. Moreover, we highlighted a role for D-aspartate in enhancing NMDAR-dependent synaptic plasticity through an inducible "turn-on/turn-off-like mechanism". Strikingly, we also showed that D-aspartate, when administered to aged mice, strongly rescued their physiological synaptic decay and attenuated their cognitive deterioration. In conclusion, our data suggest a tantalizing hypothesis for which this in-embryo-occurring D-amino acid, might disclose plasticity windows in the aging brain.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/1891/version/1', [u'Genetics & Genomics', u'Neuroscience'], [u'CEINGE - Biotecnologie Avanzate, Behavioural Neuroscience', u'IRCCS S.

[u'IL-1 regulates the IL-23 response to wheat gliadin, the etiologic agent of Celiac Disease', ['Kristina M. Harris', 'Alessio Fasano', 'Dean L. Mann'], u'2008-05-13', u'Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease prevalent in ~1% of the general population. CD is unique because both the major genetic (Human Leukocyte Antigen-DQ2/DQ8 alleles) and etiologic factors (dietary glutens) for susceptibility are known. While these alleles are responsible for the inappropriate T cell response that characterizes CD, they are not sufficient since most HLA-DQ2+/DQ8+ individuals exposed to glutens never develop disease. The reasons for this have not been explained; however our novel findings strongly advocate a role for interleukin-23 (IL-23) in the immunopathogenesis of CD. We demonstrate that wheat gliadin stimulates monocytes to produce significantly higher amounts of inflammatory cytokines IL-1b, IL-23, and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNFa) in CD patients compared to HLA-DQ2+ healthy individuals. Furthermore, we determine that IL-1 signalling is obligatory for production of IL-23, since IL-1b triggers IL-23 secretion in a dose-dependent manner and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) blocks IL-23 responses to gliadin. Our results suggest that gliadin activation of monocytes and the subsequent robust secretion of IL-1b and IL-23 initiate the immune response cascade that is manifest as CD, and reveal for the first time that the IL-1 system regulates production of IL-23. The discovery of IL-23 has highlighted the critical role of the innate immune response in autoimmunity and other inflammatory conditions. We anticipate that our novel findings will lead to the discovery of therapeutic targets for this disease and other inflammatory diseases mediated by IL-23.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/1882/version/1', [u'Genetics & Genomics', u'Immunology'], [u'University of Maryland School of Medicine, Pathology', u'University of Maryland School of Medicine, Mucosal Biology Research Center']]

[u'Preincision Processing of Cyclobutane Pyrimidine Dimers in Escherichia coli', ['Sunirmal Paul', 'Mitsumasa Hashimoto', 'Opinder Bhanot', 'Yoke Kow', 'Moon-shong Tang'], u'2008-03-21', u'In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) formed by UV-irradiation are repaired mainly by the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway. Evidence has been presented that CPDs are repaired more rapidly and efficiently in vivo than when using purified NER components in vitro, and raises the possibility that CPD can be processed at the preincision stage before being removed by NER pathway. We investigated this hypothesis in E. coli cells and found that the phosphodiester bonds in CPDs are indeed incised (for the sake of simplicity we term this result as CPD*) in a time-dependent fashion in NER-proficient cells. This CPD preincision processing also occurs in NER-deficient uvrB- and uvrC-, but not in uvrA-mutant cells, and in endonuclease V (nfi) mutant cells. Introduction of the nfi mutation into wild type or uvrB-mutant cells results in disablement of CPD to CPD* conversion and enhances UV sensitization to the level of uvrA-mutant cells. We found that in a reconstituted in vitro system, that purified UvrA and Nfi are necessary but not sufficient to convert CPD to CPD*. A UvrC homologous protein, Cho, is also needed for this conversion. In addition, we found that Nfi does not bind to UV-irradiated DNA, suggesting that UvrA and Cho proteins may function as matchmakers for Nfi-CPD binding, which consequently results in the conversion of CPD to CPD*. We further demonstrated that CPD*, but not CPD, can allow efficient translesion bypass synthesis with accuracy. We thus have elucidated a new CPD preincision processing mechanism and genes involved in this process.

Upon re-feeding of starved cells, c-Myc activity enhances the efficiency of RNA Polymerase I and SL1/TIF-1B recruitment to the rDNA and rapidly induces higher order gene loop structures in rDNA chromatin that juxtapose upstream and downstream rDNA sequences.

[u'Dissecting the mechanisms of learning-by-doing in Drosophila', ['Bjorn Brembs', 'Wolfgang Plendl'], u'2007-11-20', u'At the heart of learning-by-doing lies a well-known psychological phenomenon: information will be remembered better if it is actively generated rather than passively read or heard. First described in humans, this generation effect can also be observed in various animal models. However, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the generation effect are unknown. Here we show that two reciprocal interactions between its active and passive components contribute to the generation effect in flies. One interaction consists of the active (skill-learning) component facilitating the passive (fact-learning) component. Fact-learning, on the other hand, inhibits skill-learning. Experiments with adenylyl cyclase I deficient rutabaga mutant flies revealed that the fact- but not the skill-learning component requires this evolutionarily conserved learning gene. Using mushroom-body deficient transgenic flies we observed that the mushroom-bodies mediate the inhibition of skill-learning. This inhibition also enables generalization and prevents premature habit formation. Extended training in wildtype flies produced a phenocopy of mushroom-body impaired flies, such that generalization was abolished and goal-directed actions were transformed into habitual responses. Thus, our results identify various neural processes underlying learning-by-doing, delineate some of their synergisms and provide a framework for further dissecting them in a genetically tractable model system.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/1354/version/1', [u'Genetics & Genomics', u'Neuroscience'], [u'Institut f\xfcr Biologie, Neurobiologie, Freie Universit\xe4t Berlin', u'Theodor-Boveri-Institut f\xfcr Biowissenschaften, Lehrstuhl f\xfcr Genetik und Neurobiologie']]
[u'Mushroom-bodies mediate hierarchical interactions between fact- and skill-learning in Drosophila', ['Bjorn Brembs', 'Wolfgang Plendl'], u'2007-09-04', u'Different brain circuits mediate the acquisition of skills and habits (via operant/instrumental learning) and the acquisition of facts (via classical/Pavlovian learning). Realistic learning situations always comprise interactions of skill- and fact-learning components (composite learning). So far, these interactions have escaped thorough scrutiny. Fixed flying Drosophila melanogaster at the torque meter provide one of the very few systems where the relationship of operant and classical predictors in composite learning can be studied with sufficient rigor. Experiments with wildtype, mutant and transgenic flies show that there is an interaction between predictive stimuli (classical component) and goal-directed actions (operant component) which makes composite conditioning more effective than the operant and classical components alone. Rutabaga (rut) mutants are impaired in learning about the (classical) stimuli, but show improved (operant) behavior learning. This is the first evidence that operant and classical conditioning differ not only at the circuit, but also at the molecular level. The interaction between operant and classical components is reciprocal and hierarchical, such that an impaired classical component (in rut flies) suppresses retrieval and an intact classical component suppresses acquisition of the operant component. Experiments with transgenic flies demonstrate that this suppression of operant acquisition is mediated by the mushroom-bodies and serves to ensure that the classical memories can be generalized for access by other behaviors. Extended training can overcome this suppression and transforms goal-directed actions into habitual responses. In conclusion, composite conditioning consists of two components with reciprocal, hierarchical interactions. Acquisition of the rut-dependent classical component suppresses acquisition of the rut-independent operant component via the mushroom-bodies. The operant component facilitates acquisition of the classical component via unknown, non-mushroom-body pathways. This interaction leads to efficient learning, enables generalization and prevents premature habit-formation. Habit formation after extended training reveals the gate-keeping role of the mushroom-bodies, allowing only well-rehearsed behaviors to consolidate into habits.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/905/version/1', [u'Genetics & Genomics', u'Neuroscience'], [u'Freie Universit\xe4t Berlin, Germany', u'Universit\xe4t W\xfcrzburg, Germany']]

Objective correlates of OSMD in GWI and overlapping conditions are examined. Discussion: OSMD is an expected consequence of known GWI exposures; is compatible with symptom characteristics observed; and accords with objective markers and health conditions linked to GWI, extending to autoimmune disease and infection. Emergent triangulating evidence directly supports OSMD in multisymptom \u201coverlap\u201d CMI conditions, with similarities to, and diagnosed at elevated rates in, GWI, suggesting a common role in each. Conclusions: GWI is compatible with a paradigm by which uncompensated exposure to oxidative/nitrative stressors accompanies and triggers mitochondrial dysfunction, cell energy compromise, and multiple downstream effects such as vulnerability to autoantibodies.

The surface expression of 2B4 and other activating natural killer cell receptors is down-modulated after receptor engagement, which results in a weaker response to consecutive stimulation. We tested whether this regulatory mechanism applies to all SLAM-related receptors expressed by primary human natural killer cells. After co-culture with target cells expressing the respective ligands different effects on receptor surface expression were observed. While 2B4 ex-pression was strongly reduced, NTB-A showed less prominent down-modulation and the expression level of CRACC remained unchanged. The expression levels of the receptor-proximal signaling molecules SAP, EAT-2 and FynT did not change after receptor engagement. Co-culture with target cells expressing the ligands for NTB-A or CRACC had no impact on subsequent NTB-A or CRACC-mediated NK cell activation.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/4917/version/1', [u'Immunology'], [u'Institute for Immunology, University Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 305, Heidelberg, Germany']]

Design: Prospective randomized, controlled trial Setting: University laboratory research centerAnimals: 9-10 weeks old BALB/c female mice Interventions: In our laparoscopic mouse model acute inflammation of the peritoneal cavity and adhesion formation were evaluated in a control group with CO2 pneumoperitoneum (PP)-enhanced adhesions, in CO2 PP plus manipulation-enhanced adhesions and in the latter group + dexamethasone-reduced adhesions. Adhesions and acute inflammation were assessed by neoangiogenesis, diapedesis and leukocytes accumulation on the 2nd day after surgery. Main outcome measure(s): Qualitative and quantitative adhesion scores and an acute inflammation score.Results: Adhesions were enhanced by the CO2 PP (p=0.007), further enhanced by manipulation (p<0.0001 versus CO2 PP) and decreased by the administration of dexamethasone (p<0.0001 versus CO2 PP+manipulation ). Acute inflammation scores strongly correlated with total adhesion score whether assessed as total inflammation score (p<0.0001) or as neoangiogenesis (p<0.0002), diapedesis (p<0.03) or leukocyte accumulation (p<0.0002).

[u'Interaction of the TNFR-Receptor Associated Factor TRAF1 with I-kappa B Kinase-2 and TRAF2 Indicates a Regulatory Function for NF-kappa B Signaling ', ['Kalsoom A. Sughra', 'Andreas Birbach', 'Rainer de Martin', 'Johannes A. Schmid'], u'2010-08-13', u'BackgroundI-kappa B kinase 2 (IKK2 or IKK-beta) is one of the most crucial signaling kinases for activation of NF-kappa B, a transcription factor that is important for inflammation, cell survival and differentiation. Since many NF-kappa B activating pathways converge at the level of IKK2, molecular interactions of this kinase are pivotal for regulation of NF-kappa B signaling.Methodology/Principal FindingsWe searched for proteins interacting with IKK2 using the C-terminal part (amino acids 466-756) as bait in a yeast two-hybrid system and identified the N-terminal part (amino acids 1-228) of the TNF-receptor associated factor TRAF1 as putative interaction partner. The interaction was confirmed in human cells by mammalian two-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation experiments. The IKK2/TRAF1 interaction seemed weaker than the interaction between TRAF1 and TRAF2, an important activating adapter molecule of NF-kappa B signaling. Reporter gene and kinase assays using ectopic expression of TRAF1 indicated that it can both activate and inhibit IKK2 and NF-kappa B. Co-expression of fluorescently tagged TRAF1 and TRAF2 at different ratios implied that TRAF1 can affect clustering and presumably the activating function of TRAF2 in a dose dependent manner.Conclusions/SignificanceThe observation that TRAF1 can either activate or inhibit the NF-kappa B pathway and the fact that it influences the oligomerization of TRAF2 indicates that relative levels of IKK2, TRAF1 and TRAF2 may be important for regulation of NF-kappa B activity. Since TRAF1 is an NF-kappa B induced gene, it might act as a feedback effector molecule.

In order to find out whether the gene was expressed in the cells, the RNA was isolated and RT-PCR was carried out. Before carrying out the RT-PCR, RNA gel electrophoresis was carried out to show the 28S and 18S bands. Once the gene expression was analysed protein expression was carried out by extracting the protein using RIPA buffer and running the SDS-PAGE followed by staining. Silver staining and western blotting results revealed clear bands at 116kDa illustrating that the TLR9 protein had been expressed.

This hypothesis has been disputed in the literature.

[u'The Symmetrical Immune Network Theory and a New HIV Vaccine Concept', ['Geoffrey  W. Hoffmann'], u'2010-02-19', u'The symmetrical immune network theory is based on Jerne\u2019s network hypothesis. An improved version of the theory is presented. The theory is characterized by symmetrical stimulatory, inhibitory and killing interactions between idiotypic and antiidiotypic immune system components. In this version killing is ascribed to IgM antibodies, while IgG antibodies are stimulatory. In the symmetrical immune network theory T cells make specific T cell factors, that have a single V region, and are cytophilic for non-specific accessory cells (A cells, including macrophages and monocytes) and play a role in the system switching between stable steady states. A recurring theme in the theory is the concept of co selection. Co-selection is the mutual positive selection of individual members from within two diverse populations, such that selection of members within each population is dependent on interaction with (recognition of) one or more members within the other population. Prior to exposure to an antigen, antigen-specific and antiidiotypic T cells are equally diverse. This equality is a form of symmetry. Immune responses with the production of IgG involve co selection of the antigen-specific and antiidiotypic classes with the breaking of this diversity symmetry, while induction of unresponsiveness involves co-selection without the breaking of diversity symmetry. The theory resolves the famous I-J paradox of the 1980s, based on co selection of helper T cells with some affinity for MHC class II and suppressor T cells that are anti-anti-MHC class II. The theory leads to three experimentally testable predictions concerning I-J. The theory includes a model for HIV pathogenesis, and suggests that polyclonal IgG from many donors given in immunogenic form may be an effective vaccine for protection against infection with HIV. Surprisingly, a mathematical model that simulates the autonomous dynamics of the system is the same as one that models a previously described neural network.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/4228/version/1', [u'Immunology', u'Neuroscience'], [u'Network Immunology Inc.']]

The organism is transmitted by ingestion of oocysts, which are shed in faeces, and completes its lifecycle in a single host.1 C. parvum is ubiquitous on dairy operations worldwide and is one of the leading causes of diarrhoea in calves on these farms.2,3 Here, for the first time, we describe the antibody response in a large group of cows to a recombinant C. parvum oocyst surface protein (rCP15/60) vaccine and the antibody response in calves fed rCP15/60-immune colostrum produced by these vaccinated cows. Results of recent genotype surveys indicate that calves are the only major reservoir for C. parvum infections in humans.4 Human C. parvum infections are particularly prevalent and often fatal in neonates in developing countries and to immunocompromised people, such as AIDs patients.4 Drug therapy against cryptosporidiosis is limited and not wholly efficacious in either humans or calves5, making development of an effective vaccine of paramount importance. To date, there is no commercially available effective vaccine against C. parvum, although passive immunization utilizing different zoite surface (glyco)proteins has showed promise.6-9 All cows we vaccinated produced an antibody response to the rCP15/60 vaccine and the magnitude of response correlated strongly with the subsequent level of antibody in their colostrum. All calves fed rCP15/60-immune colostrum showed a dose-dependent absorption of antibody. Our results demonstrate that vaccination of cows with rCP15/60 successfully induces antibodies against CP15/60 in their serum and colostrum and that these antibodies are then well absorbed when fed to neonatal calves.

Since HVJ infection (1,2) and influenza virus infection (3,4) cause infected cells to activate homologous serum complement, the systemic inflammatory response elicited could be attributed to the unlimited generation of C5a anaphylatoxin of the complement system, which is a causative peptide of serious inflammation. In monkeys inoculated with a lethal dose of LPS (4 mg/kg body weight), inhibition of C5a by an inhibitory peptide termed AcPepA (5) rescued these animals from serious septic shock which would have resulted in death within a day (6). Therefore, we tested whether AcPepA could also have a beneficial effect on chickens with bird flu.

[u'Cyclin kinase inhibitor p21: a mediator of immune tolerance: direct and indirect evidence', ['Ashwani Khanna'], u'2009-06-26', u'Background: Uncontrolled proliferation of T-cells is considered a barrier to the induction of transplantation tolerance by T regulatory cells. Therefore, cyclin kinase inhibitor p21, one of the most potent inhibitors of cell proliferation, may exert an important role in the induction/generation of T regulatory cells.Methods: CD4+CD25+ and CD4+CD25- cells were isolated from normal healthy blood donors (n=6), p21-/- mice (n=9) and wild type mice (n=9). Proliferation with and without cyclosporine was quantified by 3H-thymidine uptake assay (expressed as counts per minute) and FoxP3 mRNA was studied by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Results: The difference in proliferation (p<0.002) lower (2.6 \xb1 0.8%) than wild type mice (14.5 \xb1 1.6%,) and similar to CD4+CD25- T cells, CD4+25+ T cells from p21-/- mice lacked FoxP3 gene expression. T lymphocytes from wild type inhibited the proliferation of T lymphocytes from p21-/- mice similar to the effect of CD4+CD25+ T cells on the proliferation of CD4+CD25- cells. Conclusions: Presence of the p21 creates a milieu favorable for immune tolerance and consistent with antiproliferative and immunosuppressive effect of CD4+CD25+ T-regulatory cells.

Live attenuated vaccine strains of S. equi are available but adverse reactions have been reported and they suffer from a short duration of immunity. Thus, a safe and effective vaccine against S. equi is highly desirable. In this report, Welsh mountain ponies vaccinated with a combination of seven recombinant S. equi proteins, were significantly protected from experimental infection by S. equi, resembling the spontaneous disease. The protective antigens consisted of five surface localized proteins and two IgG endopeptidases.

CD14 deficiency results in hyperphosphorylation of AKT and reduced activation of p38. Such aberrant signaling leads to decreased negative regulation by SOCS1, SOCS3, and CIS thereby engendering a more severe and persistent inflammatory response to B. burgdorferi.

[u'How gut sampling and microbial invasiveness/noninvasiveness provides mucosal immunity with a nonmolecular pattern means to distinguish commensals from pathogens: A review', ['John R. Skoyles'], u'2008-05-16', u'Mucosal immunity distinguishes not only different microbial antigens but also separates those of pathogens from those of commensals. How this is done is unknown. The present view is that the pathogen/commensal determination of antigens depends upon as yet to be discovered molecular patterns. Here I review the biological feasibility that it also involves the detection of the invasive differences in their motility towards the gut wall when they are sampled by differently biased methods. By their nature, pathogens and commensals have different motility \u2013 invasive and noninvasive \u2013 in regard to the epithelium. The immune system is in a position to detect such motility differences. This biological opportunity arises since different microbe sampling methods can \u201ccatch\u201d different groups of microbes depending upon how their motility interacts with the epithelium. A biological method biased to sample those with invasive motility\u2014pathogens\u2014could be achieved by \u2018honey pot traps\u2019 that preferentially (but not exclusively) sample microbes that have a taxis to breaches in the epithelium. A biological method biased to sample those that are noninvasive\u2014commensals\u2014could be done by capturing microbes that are passively and stably residing in the biofilm \u201coffshore\u201d of the epithelium. Such differential sampling strategies would seem to relate to those carried out respectively by (i) M-cells (working with subepithelial dome dendritic cells), and (ii) sub- and intraepithelial dendritic cells.The interactions of antigen presentation can be arranged so that the immune system links antigens from biased microbial sampling with pathogenic or commensal appropriate immune responses. Such immune classification could feasibly occur biologically through a winner-take-all competition between inhibiting and activating antigen presentation. Winner-takes-all types of processing classification are already known to underlie the biologically interactions between neurons that classify sensory inputs making it also plausible that they are exploited by the immune system. In pathogen identification, M-cell antigens would be activating and biofilm antigens inhibitory, and vise versa for commensal identification. This winner-take-all competition between antigen presentation would act to amplify small statistical biases in the two samples linked to invasiveness/noninvasiveness into a reliable pathogen/commensal distinction. This process would both complement, and acts as independent guarantor, upon the alternative pathogenicity/commensality recognition provided by molecular pattern recognition.

Immune complexes are internalized by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DC) via Fc-\u03b3 ReceptorIIA, reach the endosomal compartment and activate IFN-\u03b1 secretion through TLR7/9-dependent pathways. Naturally occurring differences in expression of the TLR7/9 gene as well as factors that modulate TLR7/9 expression, including CD154 could therefore contribute to SLE pathogenesis. Although its origin is not elucidated CD154 is hyperexpressed in SLE patients, and is important for the differentiation of autoantibody-secreting cells. We hypothesized that platelets which are an abundant source of CD154, and which can mediate proinflammatory effects could be an actor involved in SLE pathogenesis. Platelets from SLE patients are activated in vivo by circulating immune complexes which are abundant in SLE sera, via a CD32-dependent mechanism. Activated platelets formed aggregates with antigen-presenting cells in SLE patients and enhanced interferon-\u03b1 secretion induced by immune-complexes stimulated plasmacytoid DCs. Finally, in vivo depletion of platelets and megakaryocytes in NZBxNZW(F1) lupus prone mice improved all parameters assessing disease activity, whereas transfusion of activated platelets worsened the disease course.

[u'The Roles of Membrane Rafts in CD32A-Mediated Phagocytosis', ['Timothy P. Tolentino', 'Periasamy Selvaraj', 'Cheng Zhu'], u'2007-09-28', u'Membrane rafts are highly dynamic heterogeneous sterol- and sphingolipid-rich micro-domains on cell surfaces. They are generally believed to provide residency for cell surface molecules (e.g., adhesion and signaling molecules) and scaffolding to facilitate the functions of these molecules such as membrane trafficking, receptor transport, cell signaling, and endocytosis.The governing, or overall hypothesis, for this project is that membrane rafts provide residency for Fc\u03b3RIIA (CD32A) on K562 cells, and that by doing so they provide a platform from which Fc\u03b3RIIA initiate or carry out their functions, which include migration, signaling, phagocytic synapse formation, and internalization of IgG opsonized targets.Using immuno-fluorescent laser scanning confocal microscopy and reflection interference microscopy (RIM), we studied the spatial and temporal distributions of membrane rafts and surface receptors, signaling molecules, and cell organelles during the formation of phagocytic contact areas.  K562 cells, which naturally express CD32A, a cell surface receptor for the Fc portion of Immuno-globulin G(IgG), was chosen as a model for neutrophils.  An opsonized target was modeled using a glass supported lipid bilayer reconstituted with IgG.  CD32A was found to cluster and co-localize with membrane rafts. Placing the K562 cells on the lipid bilayer triggered a process of contact area formation that includes binding between receptors and ligands, their recruitment to the contact area, a concurrent membrane raft movement to and concentration in the contact area, and transport of CD32A, IgG, and membrane rafts to the Golgi complex.  Characterization of these processes was performed using agents known to disrupt detergent resistant membranes (DRMs), dissolve actin microfilaments, and inhibit myosin motor activity, which abolished the CD32A clusters and prevented the contact area formation. The relevance to phagocytosis of contact area formation between K562 cells and lipid bilayers was demonstrated using micro-beads coated with a lipid bilayer reconstituted with IgG as the opsonized target instead of the glass supported planar lipid bilayer.  Disruption of membrane rafts, salvation of the actin cytoskeleton, and inhibition of myosin II activity were found to inhibit phagocytosis.These data suggest membrane rafts play several important roles in CD32A mediated phagocytosis including pre-clustering CD32A, transport of CD32A to the phagocytic cup, and transport of the opsonized target towards the Golgi complex.  Here we have provided evidence that membrane rafts serve as platforms which are used to cluster CD32A and transport CD32A along the actin cytoskeleton to the site of phagocytic synapse formation thus allowing for the quick assembly of a phagocytic synapse.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/1191/version/1', [u'Immunology', u'Molecular Cell Biology'], [u'Wallace H.

Viral or sub-viral nucleic acids have long been sought in scrapie to explain the existence of multiple agent strains.  Many different approaches were undertaken to find such nucleic acid. Despite that no scrapie specific nucleic acid sequences have been found in infected cells or tissues.  Most viruses induce synthesis of long double stranded RNA (dsRNA) during their replication in cells. Therefore the presence of long dsRNA would be an indication of viral infection in cells.

The purpose of this investigation was to perform antibiotic susceptibility on a panel pathogenic strain of bacteria isolated step by step from dental caries infection. Materials and Methods-Bacteria were isolated from caries site of patients and cultivated identified at the species level. Each of 150 species of bacteria was tested for antibiotics susceptibility to a five antibiotics using Etest. Antibiotic used were Amoxicillin, Cloxocillin, Erythromycin, Tetracycline, Penicillin-V.Results- The percentages of Resistance in treatment for each antibiotic in this study were penicillin V: 72/150 (48%), Tetracycline: 99/150 (66%), amoxicillin: 135/150 (90%), Cloxocillin: 117/150 (78%), and Erythromycin: 90/150 (60%) (Table 1).

[u'Single gene-based distinction of individual microbial genomes from a mixed population of microbial cells', ['Manu Tamminen', 'Marko Virta'], u'2010-08-11', u'Background: Recent progress in environmental microbiology has revealed vast populations of microbes in any given habitat that cannot be detected by conventional culturing strategies. The use of sensitive genetic detection methods such as CARD-FISH and in situ PCR have been limited by the cell wall permeabilization requirement that cannot be performed similarly on all cell types without lysing some and leaving some unpermeabilized. Furthermore, the detection of low copy targets such as genes present in single copies in the microbial genomes, has remained problematic.Methodology/Principal Findings: We describe an emulsion-based procedure to trap individual microbial cells into picoliter-volume polyacrylamide droplets that provide a support for genetic material and therefore allow degradation of cellular material to expose the individual genomes. The polyacrylamide droplets are subsequently converted into picoliter-scale reactors for genome amplification. The amplified genomes are labelled based on the presence of a target gene and differentiated from those that do not contain the gene by flow cytometry. Using the Escherichia coli strains XL1 and MC1061, which differ with respect to the presence (XL1) or absence (MC1061) of a single copy of a tetracycline resistance gene per genome, we demonstrate that XL1 genomes present at 0.01% of MC1061 genomes can be differentiated using this method. Using a spiked sediment microbial sample, we demonstrate that the method is applicable to complex environmental microbial communities as a target gene-based screen for individual microbes. Conclusions/Significance: The genomic support for complete cell degradation allows an exposure of individual genomes of environmental bacteria. The genome exposure followed by genome amplification and labelling combines the benefits of in situ-PCR and FISH methods and permits the detection cells with single copy chromosomal targets in complex mixtures of microbial cells. The method could be optimized for fluorescence-activated cell sorting to enrich genetic material of interest from complex environmental samples.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/4761/version/1', [u'Microbiology'], [u'University of Helsinki']]

We find that diamagnetic levitation increases the rate of population growth in a liquid culture and reduces the sedimentation rate of the cells. Further experiments and microarray gene analysis show that the increase in growth rate is due to enhanced oxygen availability. We also demonstrate that the magnetic field that levitates the cells also induces convective stirring in the liquid. We present a simple theoretical model, showing how the paramagnetic force on dissolved oxygen can cause convection during the aerobic phases of bacterial growth. We propose that this convection enhances oxygen availability by transporting oxygen around the liquid culture. Since this process results from the strong magnetic field, it is not present in other weightless environments, e.g. in Earth orbit.

Polarization required vectorial delivery of PS-enriched secretory and recycling vesicles. Rapid dissipation of the PS gradient is prevented by the slow diffusion of lipids along the plasmalemmal inner leaflet, estimated by photobleaching recovery measurements to be over an order of magnitude slower than in mammalian cells.

Ongoing history of fever was used as a case definition for malaria and malaria was confirmed from microscopic examination of thick and thin film of blood sample obtained from the patients during presentation with fever. The CD4 count was evaluated during presentation of fever and post-fever using flow cytometry. There was significant decrease in CD4 count of the patients. However, upon classifying the patients into 2 groups \u2013 those that returned to the clinic after a week and those that returned after a month \u2013 a significant increase in CD4 count was noticed in the group that returned after a week, while a significant decrease was noticed in the group that returned after a month (at p value of 95%). Further classification of the patients based on presence of malaria parasite, and body temperature resulted in varying effects on CD4 count post-fever (in the general group, 27 were positive for malaria parasites. Of these 27, there was an increase in CD4 count in 9 (33.3%).  However in the group that returned after a week, all 6 (100%) that were positive for malaria parasites showed increase in CD4 count.

Our studies on the role of cholesterol in prion infection/replication showed that brains and peripheral cells of sheep susceptible to or suffering from Scrapie were characterized by an altered cholesterol homeostasis compared to animals with a scrapie-resistant genotype, and that drugs influencing cholesterol esterification were endowed with selective anti-prion activity in N2a cell lines infected with the 22L and RML prion strains. Results. In prion-infected N2a cell lines we now report increased anti-prion activity of dual-drug combinations consisting of cholesterol ester modulators associated with prion inhibitors Synergism was obtained with the cholesterol ester modulators everolimus, pioglitazone, progesterone, and verapamil associated with the anti-prion chlorpromazine, and with everolimus and pioglitazone associated with the anti-prion quinacrine. Comparative lipid analyses in prion-infected and non-infected N2a cells by colorimetric, enzymatic, and chemical means, clearly demonstrated a derangement of type and distribution of cholesterol esters, free cholesterol, and triglycerides in the infected N2a cells. Although single-drug treatments influenced lipid syntheses, only the combined-drug treatments appeared to restore a lipid profile similar to that of untreated-uninfected cells. Conclusions. We conclude that the anti-prion synergistic effect of cholesterol ester modulators with the cholesterol metabolism interfering anti-prion drugs chlorpromazine and quinacrine may arise from the ability of combined drugs to re-establish the intracellular lipid profile of untreated-uninfected cells. Overall, these data suggest that inhibition of prion replication can be readily potentiated by combinatorial drug treatments, and that steps of cholesterol/cholesterol ester metabolism may represent suitable targets.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/3883/version/1', [u'Microbiology', u'Neuroscience', u'Pharmacology'], [u'Department of Biomedical Science and Technology, University of Cagliari', u'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Cagliari']]

Here, the applicability of a periodic table for the genetic code of influenza A/H3N2 virus is explored.

The first rule states that non-synonymous single point mutations are intimately associated with the first or second base replacements between two congener codons of four groups (5, 6, 9, and 10) in the proposed periodic table.

In addition, it was observed that the activation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells, regulated usually in cells of the immune system, was strongly influenced after infection. When primary duck liver cells were infected with purified virions of duck hepatitis B virus the activation of this factor was reduced in a similar way as it was achieved by inhibition of calcineurin, a cellular phosphatase necessary to control the factor, whereas the addition of subviral particles inhibited this reduction. It was found that the large surface protein of the virus was responsible for the reduced activity. Although this protein was embedded in similar amounts into the envelopes of both particles, only virions were able to inhibit the activity of the nuclear factor. An explanation of the different performances of the particles in primary duck liver cells apparently depends on the individual mode of insertion of the large surface proteins into the viral membrane.

Aging is known to occur in bacteria and yeast that divide with morphological asymmetry. Morphologically symmetrically dividing bacteria such as Escherichia coli were assumed not to age until they were shown to divide with functional asymmetry leading to aging and death of some of the cells even in exponentially growing cultures. In asymmetrically dividing E. coli the newly synthesized components are presumed to occupy one pole so that after division one of the daughter cells receives newly synthesized components whereas the other retains the older components. Mathematical models predicted that at the population level, asymmetric growth should result in higher growth rate and symmetric growth in higher growth yield. Therefore, arguably symmetric cell division should be selected in low nutrient environments and asymmetric division in nutrient rich environments. A further prediction was that lower substrate concentrations should strengthen repair mechanisms and suppress aging whereas higher substrate concentrations suppress repair and enhance aging. We show here that E. coli divides more symmetrically under caloric restriction, that both genetic selection and phenotypic plasticity are important determinants of cell division symmetry and also that the proportion of cells that stop dividing and therefore are presumably dead is significantly lower in symmetrically dividing cultures. However, contrary to the prediction, symmetry was not always accompanied by reduced growth rate. These results demonstrate that asymmetry of division in E. coli is not hardwired but responsive to the nutritional environment. This provides a new perspective on why caloric restriction increases lifespan in organisms ranging from microbes to mammals.

Bacterial shoot blight (BSB) disease, caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. theae (Pst), is a major bacterial disease of tea plants in Japan and substantially reduces tea productivity. BSB mainly occurs in the low-temperature season, and lesion formation by Pst is enhanced by both low temperature and the presence of ice nucleation-active Xanthomonas campestris (INAX), which catalyses ice formation at -2 to -4oC and is frequently co-isolated with Pst from tea plants5. Low temperature is thus the most important environmental factor to influence the incident; however, the effects of environmental controls in fields on the occurrence of the disease are poorly understood.

Hydrophobic molecules,  including proteins, accumulate  selectively  into  stable  populations,  enriched  in  high  density  water,  at charged  sites on  biopolymers.

Diabetic patients glycemic control can be achieved by increasing the blood concentration of GLP-1, a hormone produced by L cells that are more densely concentrated in the terminal ileum. Early and extended improvement of diabetes in patients submitted to bariatric surgeries awakened the necessity of investigating the isolated ileal interposition as surgical alternative for the treatment of diabetes. The interposition of this ileal segment to a more anterior region (proximal jejunum) can promote a greater stimulation of the L cells by poorly digested food, increasing the production of GLP-1 and reflecting on glycemic control. However, in order to consolidate the ileal interposition as a surgical treatment of diabetes it is necessary that the interposed ileum keep the same differentiation rate into L cells for a long period to justify the intervention.AIMS: To investigate the isolated ileal interposition influence on the differentiation of intestinal precursor cells into enteroendocrine L cells over time.METHODS: Twelve 12-week-old male Wistar rats (Rattus norvegicus albinus) of the WAB strain (heterogeneous) will be used. All animals will receive a high-calorie, high-fat diet for 16 weeks or more until they develop glucose dysmetabolism confirmed by glycemic test. They will be divided into two groups of 10 animals each: the isolated ileal interposition group (GI) and the control group (GC), comprising animals that will not be submitted to any surgical intervention. Blood samples will be collected under anesthesia at the weeks 12, 26, 36 and 44 for the determination of serum levels of glucose, insulin, GLP-1, glucagon, C-peptide and glycosilated hemoglobin. The insulin tolerance test will be performed and insulin resistance will be calculated. For the comparative analysis of the ileal precursor cells differentiation into enteroendocrine cells among the two groups, the following intestinal fragments will be collected after euthanasia: interposed ileum and remaining ileum from GI, jejunum and ileum from GC. These fragments will be analyzed by imunofluorescence and also by Real Time PCR using PCR Arrays for target genes including the main ones related to stem cell, stem cell singnalling, diabetes, Wnt and Notch signaling pathways and other genes and pathways involved in the differentiation of intestinal precursor cells into enteroendocrine cells, especially GLP-1-producing L cells that play important role in euglycemia.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/6614/version/2', [u'Molecular Cell Biology'], [u'Federal University of Sao Paulo, Brazil']]

Golomb'], u'2011-10-15', u'Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is commonly presumed to stem from obesity, with both propelled by energy surfeit: positive balance of calories consumed to energy expended. A complementary thesis is proposed: that episodes of cell energy deficit (not expressly calorie deficit) drive MetS \u2013 the \u201cStarving Cell.\u201d Risk factors for MetS include hypoxemia from sleep apnea, severe calorie debt, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress; and sleep restriction, illness, surgery, trauma, cold. Each fosters inadequate cell energy, hampering production or boosting demand. MetS factors support energy: glucose, triglycerides, abdominal/visceral fat \u2013 and blood pressure, sustaining perfusion. Additional energy-supportive adaptations co-occur in MetS: e.g. increased free fatty acids and deposition of metabolically active ectopic fat. Indeed, increased appetite/calories and reduced activity \u2013 features of the energy surfeit model \u2013 also arise as adaptations to cell energy deprivation. Among persons who are overweight, the risk for MetS remains determined by energy deprivation contributors. The Thrifty Gene hypothesis, and MetS promotion by fetal energy deprivation, prefigure the Starving Cell thesis. However, evidence is vastly more comprehensive in connecting cell energy deprivations to MetS elements: generalizing the sources of energy deficit that dispose to MetS; the populations vulnerable to their impact; and the forms of adaptation implemented to protect energy. This clarifies why MetS factors cohere; and why other energy-supportive adaptations attend them. It explains bidirectional MetS associations; and why MetS factors appear \u201cparadoxically\u201d protective in some populations. It generates predictions, and suggests approaches to MetS mitigation that complement and modify existing approaches, and may augment their efficacy.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/6535/version/1', [u'Molecular Cell Biology'], [u'Department of Medicine; Department of Family and Preventive Medicine University of California, San Diego']]

Using both in vitro and in vivo models and samples from patients, this study demonstrates for the first time that CRP plays important roles in reducing the toxic effects of histones released into the circulation after extensive cell death. CRP protects endothelial cells by preventing histone integration into the cell membrane and thus reducing Ca2+ influx. In vivo, circulating histones cause endothelial damage, increased microvascular permeability, coagulation activation and IL-6 secretion. The latter induces CRP production in hepatocytes to form a negative feedback loop, a possible evolutionally conserved mechanism to limit secondary damage after extensive tissue injury.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Because intraalveolar CO2 concentration ([CO2]iA) declines as a consequence of poor pulmonary perfusion we postulated the existence a novel alveolar CO2-sensing mechanism which adapts the ventilation to perfusion. Real-time fluorescence imaging of rat lungs revealed that low [CO2]iA decreased cytosolic and increased mitochondrial Ca2+ in alveolar epithelial cells (AEC), leading to reduction of surfactant secretion and alveolar ventilation. Mitochondrial inhibition by ruthenium red or rotenone blocked the hypocapnia-induced responses. In cultured Type 2 AEC hypocapnia decreased cytosolic Ca2+ independently from pH and increased the NADH production, the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and subsequently the mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. All responses were completely blocked by the gene knockdown of the NADH producing Krebs cycle enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase. Furthermore, ligature of the pulmonary artery of rabbits decreased alveolar ventilation, surfactant secretion, and lung compliance. Addition of 5% CO2 to the inspiratory gas inhibited all responses. Accordingly, we provide evidence for a novel CO2-sensing mechanism of AEC regulated by the Krebs cycle activity in terms of a negative feedback loop adapting surfactant secretion and thus regional ventilation to pulmonary perfusion.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/6185/version/1', [u'Molecular Cell Biology'], [u'University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf, Department of Anesthesiology']]

However, inhibition of NCX1 enhances cell blebbing to cause cell swelling which is correlated with an intracellular sodium accumulation induced by NHE17. These data suggest that sodium influx induced by NHE1 is a driving force for membrane blebbing growth, while sodium efflux induced by NCX1 in a reverse mode causes membrane blebbing retraction.

However, its role has not been identified in substantial detail. With the advent of the fact that CD34 binds adapter protein like CRK-L in cytosol and CD34 knock out studies identified a a signaling role, CD34 antigen has been proposed to play a signaling function. Since it is a sialomucin, a member of the group adhesion molecules, we attempted to identify a role by over-expreesing its gene in cell lines.

Therefore, targeting of protein-protein interactions that have been identified as mediators of transcriptional repression that blocks normal hematopoietic differentiation holds great promise for therapeutic applications. An example is GATA-1, a critical erythroid transcription factor that is capable of suppressing the myeloid phenotype by down-regulating PU.1 in a dose-dependent manner. PU.1 is the most crucial transcription factor known to be required for myeloid differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells or progenitor cells. Its reduced expression correlates with a bad prognosis and immature phenotype in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). GATA-1 downregulates PU.1 by interacting though its C-terminal zinc finger region with the \u03b23/\u03b24 region of PU.1 and displacing its coactivator c-Jun. We hypothesize that disruption of PU.1-GATA-1 interaction by mutating the \u03b23/\u03b24 region of PU.1 may prevent its GATA-1-mediated repression, which in turn will upregulate PU.1 expression and hence myelopoiesis.

[u'EGFP-FMRP Granules Are Proto-Granules That Can Be Shunted to Stress Granules During a Stress Response', ['Robert Denman'], u'2010-12-27', u'Overexpressed EGFP-FMRP has been used as a substitute for endogenous fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) in protein-protein interaction studies, and in studies concerning the composition, the formation and the localization of neuronal granules. However, the question of whether this tool truly recapitulates the properties of the endogenous protein has not been addressed. Here we demonstrate that overexpressed EGFP-FMRP forms three distinct granule types based on colocalization with various marker proteins. The majority of EGFP-FMRP-containing granules are larger and more amorphous than known granule types. Consistent with this, there is only partial colocalization with stress granule or P-body markers and no colocalization with a putative Drosophila ortholog neuronal granule marker. Nevertheless, agents such as arsenite and hippurstanol, which create endogenous stress granules and P-bodies, drive EGFP-FMRP into such granules. Additionally, whereas inhibiting cellular methyl-protein formation alters the composition of endogenous FMRP-containing stress granules, we found that such treatment had little effect on the formation of EGFP-FMRP granules, or their composition. Altogether these data suggest that many overexpressed EGFP-FMRP granules represent proto-stress granules requiring external stimuli for their conversion. More importantly, the inherent heterogeneity of these granules suggests that caution should be used in extrapolating results obtained with EGFP-tagged surrogates of FMRP to endogenous FMRP granules.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/5442/version/1', [u'Molecular Cell Biology', u'Neuroscience'], [u'NYS Institute for Basic Research in Developmental Disabilities']]

Several lines of evidence are now indicating an association between alterations of cholesterol homeostasis and cell cycle progression in cancer cells. However, the role of cholesterol in cell differentiation is still largely unknown. To begin to address this issue, in this study we examined changes in cholesterol metabolism and in the mRNA levels of proteins involved in cholesterol import and esterification (multi-drug resistance, MDR-3) and acylCoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) and cholesterol export (caveolin-1) in Friend virus-induced erythroleukemia cells (MELC), in the absence or in the presence of the chemical inducer of differentiation, hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA). In uninduced MELC, cholesterol synthesis, esterification and MDR-3 and ACAT mRNAs increased as cells progressed from resting to proliferating phase, while caveolin-1 decreased. These results provide evidence that cholesterol esterification \u201cper se\u201d may have a role in cell division. When MELC are treated with HMBA, the reduction of DNA synthesis caused by the inducer is accompanied by an extensive decrease of cholesterol esterification and of ACAT and MDR-3 mRNA levels and by a significant increase in caveolin-1 mRNA. On the other hand, detection of cytoplasmic neutral lipids by staining MELC with oil-ORO, a dye able to evidence CE but not FC, revealed that HMBA-treatment inhibits cholesterol ester accumulation in MELC to approximately the same extent as the ACAT inhibitor, SaH.

How kinesin converts chemical energy into directed motion is a question that has been actively studied since its discovery. Even at the most coarse-grained level of chemical kinetics, understanding is still lacking. Minimal kinetic models are often developed to both explain kinesin\u2019s hand-over-hand forward-stepping behavior and to infer important kinetic rate constants from experimental data. These minimal models are often limited to a handful of two-headed states on a core cycle and have been essential for the current level of understanding. However, it is not always clear how to evolve these core-cycle models to explain more complex behavior such as non-processive motion. We have taken a different approach and have developed a kinetic model without a pre-defined core cycle. Our model includes 80 two-headed states and permits transitions between any two states that differ by a single catalytic or binding event. We constrain the rate constants as much as possible by published experimental data. We define many of the remaining unknown rate constants based on mechanical strain in the kinesin neck linkers and their docking state. We present a one-dimensional  model for neck-linker modulation of head binding and unbinding rates and nucleotide binding and unbinding rates.

Hence, C value increase exerts an ambiguous effect on MGT. The C value is not the only factor, which determines the duration of the plant development.

The classical role attributed to RBC was scavenging of NO, thereby impacting the local bioavailability of this important regulator of vascular tone1.

Under specific conditions, haemoglobin plays an active role in converting NO derivatives (e.g., nitrite) to NO4, 5, with this NO originating from RBC being an effective modulator of vascular smooth muscle tone6. Interestingly, RBC contain a NO synthase (NOS) protein7, can actively synthesize NO using L-arginine as a substrate8, and can export NO under appropriate conditions8, 9.

A biochemical model for neuronal development that might have implications for AD, recently proposed by Nikolaev and co-workers, hinges on a novel protein-protein interaction between the death cell receptor six (DR6) ectodomain and an N-terminal fragment of amyloid precursor protein (NAPP). The model provides a coherent and satisfying framework for better understanding AD pathophysiology. Moreover, the DR6-NAPP interaction offers a tempting target for novel pharmacological intervention. Given all of this, we constructed a structural model of the DR6-NAPP interaction using the neurotrophin p75 receptor as a template. Importantly, crucial steps in the modeling pipeline were independently validated using the p75 receptor. The final docked model shows excellent agreement with a variety of biophysical and theoretical data sets. Particularly worth noting is the excellent observed agreement between the theoretically calculated DR6-NAPP binding free energy and the corresponding experimental quantity. In brief, the balance of the evidence suggests that the DR6-NAPP model proposed here should prove useful in future studies, modeling work and efforts aimed at structure-based drug design.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/4545/version/1', [u'Molecular Cell Biology', u'Neuroscience'], [u'Sacred Heart University, Department of Chemistry', u'Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry']]

On the other hand, the tumor-suppressor gene p53 and its downstream genes consist of a complex molecular signaling network and p53 is at the center of this network regulating diverse physiological responses to cancer-related stresses. We report here that h-eag1 expression is controlled by the p53\u2212miR-34\u2212E2F1 pathway through a negative feed-forward mechanism. We first established E2F1 as a transactivator of h-eag1 gene. We then revealed that miR-34, a known transcriptional target of p53, is an important negative regulator of h-eag1 through dual mechanisms by directly repressing h-eag1 at the post-transcriptional level and indirectly silencing h-eag1 at the transcriptional level via repressing E2F1. The antisense against h-eag1 antagonized the growth-stimulating effects and the upregulation of h-eag1 expression in SHSY5Y cells, induced by E2F1 overexpression, inhibition of p53 activity, or knockdown of miR-34. Thus, negative regulation of p53 causes oncogenic overexpression of h-eag1 by relieving the negative feed-forward regulation of the p53\u2212miR-34\u2212E2F1 pathway or overexpression of h-eag1 fulfills the oncogenic cell growth-stimulating effect of p53 inactivation.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/4507/version/1', [u'Molecular Cell Biology'], [u'Montreal Heart Institute, Research Center ', u'Harbin Medical University, Pharmacology']]
[u'p53 Response to DNA Damage in S-phase', ['David Reisman', 'Paula Takahashi', 'Amanda Polson'], u'2010-04-29', u'p53 induces the transcription of genes that negatively regulate progression of the cell cycle in response to DNA damage or other cellular stressors, and thus participates in maintaining genome stability. Under stress conditions, p53 must be activated to prohibit the replication of cells containing damaged DNA. However, in normal, non-stressed cells, p53 activity must be inhibited. Previous studies have demonstrated that p53 transcription is activated before or during early S-phase in cells progressing from G0/G1 into S-phase. In that this is not what would be predicted from a gene involved in growth arrest and apoptosis, in this study, we provide evidence that this induction occurs to provide available p53 mRNA in order to prepare the cell for DNA damage in S-phase, ensuring a rapid response to DNA damage before exiting this stage. When comparing exponential to synchronized Swiss3T3 cells upon Camptothecin-induced DNA damage, we found that in synchronized cells, p53 protein levels increased earlier, Bax and p21 transcription was activated earlier and to a greater extent and apoptosis occurred earlier and to a greater extent. These findings are consistent with p53 transcription being induced in S-phase to provide for a rapid DNA-damage response during S-phase of the cell cycle.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/4403/version/1', [u'Molecular Cell Biology'], [u'University of South Carolina, Biological Sciences']]

[u'A schistosome \u03b2 subunit remodels inactivation of a calcium channel via an N-terminal polyacidic motif', ['Vicenta Salvador-Recatala', 'Robert M. Greenberg'], u'2010-02-19', u'The beta subunit of high voltage-activated Ca (Cav) channels targets the pore forming \u03b11 subunit to the plasma membrane and defines the biophysical phenotype of the Cav channel complex. Cav channel inactivation following activation and opening is tightly regulated and is an essential property that not only prevents excessive entry of Ca2+ into the cell but may also have functions in signal transduction. The \u03b2 subunit modulates Ca2+-dependent and voltage-dependent components of Cav channel inactivation via its interaction with the I-II linker of the \u03b11 subunit. Here, using Cav2.3 and whole-cell patch-clamp, we show that a \u03b2 subunit from the human parasite Schistosoma mansoni (\u03b2Sm) accelerates inactivation via a unique, long N-terminal polyacidic motif (NPAM). The accelerating effect of NPAM-containing subunits, both native (\u03b2Sm)and chimeric mammalian \u03b21b, \u03b22a and \u03b23 subunits to which NPAM had been attached, was only apparent when Ca2+ was internally buffered with BAPTA (5 mM) or when Ba2+ was used as the charge carrier, two commonly used strategies to eliminate Ca2+/calmodulin dependent inactivation. These results indicate that calmodulin is not involved. In addition to accelerating inactivation, NPAM-containing \u03b2 subunits significantly reduced current density with respect to their non NPAM-bearing counterparts. Interestingly, when the amino acids N terminal to NPAM were deleted, inactivation of Cav2.3 currents was faster than in the presence of the entire N-terminal portion of the \u03b2Sm subunit, as if the pre-NPAM region counteracts the effect of NPAM. Presence of NPAM also resulted in currents that activated faster, suggesting that NPAM increases open channel probability. However, NPAM does not modulate inactivation gating.

A number of miRNAs have been found to be present in blood plasma and other body fluids of humans and mice in surprisingly high concentrations. This observation was unexpected in two respects: first, the fact that these molecules are present at all outside the cell at significant concentrations; and second, that these molecules appear to be stable outside of the cell. In light of this it has been suggested that the biological function of miRNAs may also extend outside of the cell and mediate cell-cell communication[1-5]. Such a system would be expected to export specific miRNAs from cells in response to specific biological stimuli. We report here that after serum deprivation several human cell lines tested do export a spectrum of miRNAs into the culture medium. The export response is substantial and prompt. The exported miRNAs are found both within and outside of microvesicles and exosomes. We have identified some candidate protein components of this system outside the cell, and found one exported protein that plays a role in protecting miRNA from degradation.

[u'Technical Note: The Use of RNA-interference as a Tool to Find Proteins Involved in Melanosome Formation or Transport', ['Eva M.

Mutations in proteins required for melanosome transport and formation lead to a range of pigmentation defects, manifested at the cellular level as perinuclear clustering of melanosomes, or reduced sorting of melanosomal cargo such as tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP1). A pilot screen was carried out to investigate whether a combination of cellular imaging and RNA interference could be used to identify new proteins involved in pigmentation pathways. In this study, eleven genes known to play a role in melanosome transport/formation or other pigmentation properties were knocked down in mouse melanocytes with shRNAmir constructs. The investigated genes were TYRP1, pallidin, cappuccino, dysbindin, HPS5, LYST, Myosin Va, melanophilin, RhoA, UBPY and mahogunin. In a blinded confocal imaging experiment, the only reproducible change observed in cells in which these targets were knocked down was a decrease in TYRP1 levels upon transfection with knockdown constructs against TYRP1 itself, or one of three constructs targeting HPS5 (Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome 5). Upon analysis with high-content imaging software, only the knockdown construct against TYRP1 itself was detected. RT-PCR analysis showed that many of the shRNAmir constructs did not reduce mRNA and proteins levels enough to detect effects on melanosome properties. This was further examined for melanophilin, a protein necessary for melanosome transport. Altogether, the data show that this system is currently not sensitive enough for use in a screen for unknown regulators of melanosome transport and formation. The main obstacle appears to be incomplete reduction of target protein levels. Our observation that a ~50% reduction in mRNA level is not sufficient to elicit an effect is supported by the fact that heterozygous carriers of melanosomal transport disorders (Griscelli Syndrome, Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome) do not display diseases phenotypes.

The former is mainly involved in the detoxification of chemical reactive species; the latter in the regulation of cell proliferation. G6PD deficiency is the most common enzymopathy in the human population, characterized by decreased G6PD activity, mainly in red blood cells, but actually also in nucleated cells. This decreased activity is not due to enzyme synthesis impairment, but rather to reduced enzyme stability, which leads to a shortening of its half-life. Therefore, a major problem is to understand the underlying mechanisms linking G6PD deficiency to oxidative stress and cell proliferation. In order to address this issue, in the present study we utilized, as an experimental model, fibroblasts isolated from pterygium, an ocular proliferative lesion, from G6PD normal and deficient (PFs+ and PFs-, respectively) patients. Our choice was determined by the fact that pterygium is believed to be caused by chronic oxidative stress induced by UV exposure, and that pterygium fibroblasts resemble a tumorigenic phenotype. As controls we utilized fibroblasts isolated from conjunctiva from G6PD normal and deficient patients (NCFs+ and NCFs-, respectively) who had undergone cataract surgery. Growth rate analysis revealed that PFs grow faster than NCFs, but while NCFs- grow more slowly than NCFs+, PFs- and PFs+ grow at the same rate. This was associated with significantly lower G6PD activity in NCFs+ compared to NCFs-, while no significant differences in the G6PD activity of PFs+ and PFs- were noted. This result was supported by the finding that in PFs-, G6PD mRNA levels were significantly higher than in PFs+. Another interesting finding of this study was increased green autofluorescence in both NCFs- and PFs- compared to corresponding positive cells, indicative of pronounced oxidative stress in deficient cells. Finally, abnormal accumulation of neutral lipids, mainly cholesterol esters was observed both in PFs- and PFs+ compared to NCFs- and NCFs+. Though further studies are necessary for better understanding the exact mechanism which links G6PD to oxidative stress and cell proliferation, our data allow to speculate on the role of G6PD on tumorigenesis, and to consider G6PD-deficient subjects at major risk to develop common and dreaded proliferative disorders, such as atherosclerosis and cancer.

Intracellular Ca2+ transients in HEK293 cells elicited by stimulation of purinergic P2Y2-receptors were augmented but more transient after expression of hBest1, in contrast to dominant negative hBest1-R218C, which attenuated Ca2+ increase. The p21-activated protein kinase Pak2 was found to phosphorylate hBest1, thereby enhancing Ca2+ signaling and activation of Ca2+ dependent Cl- (TMEM16A)4 and K+ (SK4)5 channels. Lack of bestrophin 1 expression in respiratory epithelial cells of mBest1 knockout mice caused expansion of ER cisterns and induced Ca2+ deposits.

[u'Effect of Stimulators upon Human Hepatic Adenylate Cyclase Activity: A Tool of Nitroimidazole Cytotoxicity Assessment', ['Rakesh Sharma', 'Soonjo Kwon'], u'2009-02-04', u'Nitroimidazole is an antibiotic and radiosensitizer chemical with great potentials in imaging. The hepato-cytoxicity evaluation of nitroimidazole and possible energy status changes in liver cells due to its anti-inflammatory characteristics are crucial in tumor imaging and chemotherapy. Adenylate cyclase is key enzyme to cause energy imbalance leading to cytotoxicity. To evaluate energy status in hepatocytes and Kupffer cells, adenylate cyclase activities in isolated liver cells were compared in presence of stimulators. To evaluate the effect of effectors on adenylate cyclase in cultured hepatocyte cells, adenylate cyclase enzyme was stimulated by different GITP, GTP, progesterone and nitroimidazole effectors. In cultured Kupffer cells, prostaglandin E2 and F2\u03b1 were used as effectors. The results showed that nitroimidazole decreased adenylate cyclase specific activity in dose-dependent manner after pre-incubation of hepatocytes with the nitroimidazole in medium. Nitroimidazole stimulated adenylate cyclase activities in hepatocytes were mediated by cAMP and determined by cAMP mesurement. The stimulatory effect of nitroimidazole on adenylate cyclase was independent of the GTP presence in the assay system perhaps due to a direct effect on the catalytic subunit of adenylate cyclase enzyme. In addition, basal cAMP generation in hepatocyte cells was efficiently suppressed by the nitroimidazole. In conclusion, nitroimidazole exhibits direct effect on the catalytic subunit of the adenylate cyclase system.

Unlike its homologs Ras and Rap, ARHI functions as a tumor suppressor. Our previous study showed that ARHI can interact with transcription activator Stat3 and inhibit its nuclear translocation in human breast and ovarian cancer cells. To identify proteins that interact with ARHI in nuclear translocation, we have performed proteomic analysis and identified several importins that can associate with ARHI. To further explore this novel finding, we have purified 10 GST-importin fusion proteins (importin 7, 8, 13, b1, a1, a3, a5, a6, a7 as well as mutant a1). Using a GST-pull down assay, we found that ARHI can bind strongly to most importins; however, its binding is significantly reduced with an importin a1 mutant which contains an altered nuclear localization signal (NLS) domain. In addition, an ARHI N-terminal deletion mutant (NTD) exhibits much less binding to all importins than does wild type ARHI ARHI and NTD proteins were purified and tested for their ability to inhibit nuclear importation of proteins in HeLa cells. ARHI protein inhibits interaction of Ran-importin complexes with GFP fusion proteins that contain an NLS domain and a beta-like import receptor binding domain, blocking their nuclear localization. Addition of ARHI also blocked nuclear localization of phosphorylated Stat3\u03b2. By GST-pull down assays, we found that ARHI could compete for Ran-importins binding.

Unlike a K+ channel having four equivalent K+-binding sites in its selectivity filter, a NaK channel conducting both Na+ and K+ ions has a vestibule in the middle part of its selectivity filter, in which ions can diffuse but not bind specifically. However, how the NaK channel conducts ions remains elusive. Here we find four water grottos connecting with the vestibule of the NaK selectivity filter. Molecular dynamics and free energy calculations show that water molecules moving in the vestibule-grotto complex hydrate and stabilize ions in the filter and serve as a valve in conveying ions through the vestibule for controllable ion permeating. During ion conducting, the water molecules are confined within the valve to guarantee structure stability. The efficient exquisite hydration valve should exist and play similar roles in the large family of cyclic nucleotide-gated channels which have similar selectivity filter sequences.

Hsp70s are central to protein folding, refolding, and trafficking in organisms ranging from Archae to Homo Sapiens, both at normal and at stressed cellular conditions. Hsp70s are comprised of two main domains: a 44 kDa N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain (NBD), and a 25 kDa substrate-binding domain (SBD) that harbors the substrate binding site. The nucleotide binding site in the NBD and the substrate binding site in the SBD are allosterically linked: ADP binding promotes substrate binding, while ATP binding promotes substrate release. It has long been a goal of structural biology to characterize the nature of the allosteric coupling in these proteins. However, even the most sophisticated X-ray crystallography studies of the isolated NBD could show no difference in overall conformation between the ATP and ADP state. Hence the dilemma: how is the state of the nucleotide communicated between NBD and SBD? The solution of the dilemma is especially interesting in light of the fact that Hsp70s are ancient proteins, and amongst the first allosteric proteins in nature.Here we report a solution NMR study of the NBD of the Hsp70 from Thermus thermophilus, in the APO, ADP and AMP-PNP states, where the latter is a non-hydrolysable ATP analogue. Using the modern NMR methods of residual dipolar coupling analysis, we discovered that the nucleotide binding cleft opens up by as much as 20 degrees between the AMP-PNP (closed) and ADP (open) state. We also discover that a surface cleft, hypothesized to be essential for the allosteric coupling between NBD and SBD, echoes these changes. Hence, the nature of the allosteric trigger and coupling for Hsp70 chaperones is revealed here for the first time, solving the dilemma.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/1978/version/1', [u'Molecular Cell Biology'], [u'University of Michigan, Department of Biological Chemistry and Department of Chemistry']]

It was thought that VSMC do not express NOS by themselves, but to the time of those studies immunohistochemical techniques were not what they are now. State-of-the-art immunohistochemistry permits nowadays to localize NOS both to the endothelium and to VSMC. However, the principal question remained unanswered, is the NO generation by VSMC physiologically relevant? We hypothesized that the destruction of the vascular wall anatomical integrity by rubbing the blood vessel intimal surface may increase vascular superoxides that, in turn, reduce NO bioactivity. To address this issue, we examined ACh-induced vasorelaxation in endothelium-deprived blood vessels under protection against oxidative stress and found that superoxide scavengers \u2013 tempol and N-acetyl-L-cysteine \u2013 restored vasodilatory responses to ACh in endothelium-deprived blood vessels without influencing the vascular wall tension in intact blood vessels. Herewith we provided the first evidence that VSMC can release NO in amounts sufficient to account for the vasorelaxatory response to ACh.

At the Drosophila neuromuscular junction, a mutation in the type II metabotropic glutamate receptor gene (mGluRA) increased motor neuron excitability by disrupting an autocrine, glutamate-mediated negative feedback. We show that mGluRA mutations increase neuronal excitability by preventing PI3 kinase (PI3K) activation and consequently hyperactivating the transcription factor Foxo. Furthermore, glutamate application increases levels of phospho-Akt, a product of PI3K signaling, within motor nerve terminals in an mGluRA-dependent manner. In humans, PI3K and type II mGluRs are implicated in epilepsy, neurofibromatosis, autism, schizophrenia and other neurological disorders; however, neither the link between type II mGluRs and PI3K, nor the role of Foxo in the control of neuronal excitability, had been previously reported. Our work suggests that some of the deficits in these neurological disorders might result from disruption of glutamate-mediated homeostasis of neuronal excitability.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/1767/version/1', [u'Molecular Cell Biology', u'Neuroscience'], [u'Rice University, Department of Biochemistry and Cell biology']]

Until proper attachment of the mitotic spindle to the kinetochore is established, the ubiquitin ligase (E3) Cdc20-activated APC/C (anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome) is repressed by the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) and sister chromatin cohesion is protected. Mutants defective in SAC fail to arrest at metaphase even in the presence of damaged microtubules. Interestingly, a similar phenomenon occurs in yeast cells defective in Bub2, a negative factor of the mitotic exit network (MEN), which is required for telophase onset, although its precise molecular mechanism is unknown. Here, we show that chromosome missegregation occurs frequently in bub2\u2206 cells in the presence of damaged microtubules. The loss of Bub2 caused precocious activation of APC/C-Cdh1/Hct1 at pre-anaphase, leading to securin degradation and then separase-mediated cohesin cleavage. Overexpression of CDH1 and CDC14, encoding Cdc14 phosphatase, at pre-anaphase similarly caused chromosome missegregation. Thus, sequential activation of APC/C-Cdc20 and then APC/C-Cdh1 is critical for precise chromosome segregation and precocious activation of APC/C-Cdh1 at pre-anaphase causes genomic instability. Since degradation of human securin is also mediated by APC/C-Cdc20 and APC/C-Cdh1, this study predicts that precocious activation APC/C-Cdh1 in human cells similarly causes genomic instability, and thereby cell death or tumorigenesis.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/1603/version/1', [u'Molecular Cell Biology'], [u'Shizuoka University, Faculty of Science ', u'Shizuoka University, Faculty of Science', u'Graduate School of Advanced Sciences of Matter, Hiroshima University, Department of Molecular Biotechnology']]

UV irradiation induced the assembly of SGs during the G2 phase and newly formed SGs appeared exclusively in the early G1 phase. SG assembly pathway was activated within the first hours after DNA damage, suggesting that the processing of destabilized RNAs is activated at an early stage. The induction of SGs and RNAi effector protein Argonaute 2 recruitment after UV exposure was independent of ATM and ATR signaling cascades. Apoptosis occurred only in SG-negative cells indicating that SGs promote cell survival after genotoxic stress. Analysis of several DNA damage/repair deficient MEFs revealed that the SG accumulation remained unaltered after UV exposure.

Phosphorylation of eIF2 is known to be central to the global regulation of protein synthesis under stress conditions and infection2. Another distinctive feature of eukaryotic translation is scanning of mRNA 5\u2019-leaders, whose origin in evolution may be relevant to the appearance of eIF2 in eukaryotes. Translation initiation on the hepatitis C virus (HCV) internal ribosome entry site (IRES) occurs without scanning3,4. Whether these unique features of the HCV IRES account for the formation of the final 80S initiation complex is unknown. Here we show that the HCV IRES-directed translation can occur without either eIF2 or its GTPase activating protein eIF5. In addition to the general eIF2- and eIF5-dependent pathway of 80S complex assembly, the HCV IRES makes use of a prokaryotic-like pathway which involves eIF5B, the analogue of bacterial IF25,6, instead of eIF2. This switch from a eukaryotic-like mode of AUG selection to a \u201cbacterial\u201d one occurs when eIF2 is inactivated by phosphorylation, a way with which host cells counteract infection. The relative resistance of HCV IRES-directed translation to eIF2 phosphorylation may represent one more line of defense used by this virus against host antiviral responses and can contribute to the well known resistance of HCV to interferon based therapy.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/1518/version/1', [u'Molecular Cell Biology'], [u'Lomonosov Moscow State University, Belozersky Institute of Physico-Chemical Biology']]

Previous epidemiological and experimental studies indicated cholesterol as a central player  in Alzheimer disease (AD). Here, we utilized skin fibroblasts and PBMC as possible ex vivo models for the study of dysfunctions of cholesterol homeostasis which may be related to AD development. Methods. We analyzed cholesterol homeostasis using colorimetric, thin layer chromatography (TLC), and histologic technique in ex vivo cultures of skin fibroblasts and PBMCs from patients with probable AD and their first-degree relatives. Additionally, healthy age-matched individuals served as controls. Findings. As compared to controls, skin fibroblasts and PBMCs from AD patients, displayed an evident alteration of cholesterol metabolism; namely an anomalous accumulation of cholesterol esters in their cytoplasm. No change in intracellular free cholesterol was observed. Cellular overloading of cholesterol esters was dramatically increased after specific growth stimulation of the different cell types. Cholesterol ester accumulation was negatively correlated to plasma levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and positively correlated with severity of cognitive symptoms measured by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Inhibitors of  cholesterol esterification, such as progesterone and SaH, as well as a potent inhibitor of  cell proliferation, RAD, were able to prevent accumulation of cholesterol esters. Interpretation. Changes of cholesterol esters in the peripheral compartment may be indicative of a systemic alteration of intracellular cholesterol homeostasis, which in turn might create a cellular milieu favourable to the production of \xdf-amyloid in the brain.

So far, no means for ante-mortem diagnosis are available for Scrapie as well as for any other mammal Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopaties. We recently found a strong relationship between cell susceptibility to scrapie-infection and intracellular cholesterol homeostasis alterations. In brain tissues as well as in ex vivo cultures of skin fibroblasts and PBMCs from healthy and scrapie-affected sheep carrying a scrapie-susceptible (ARQ/ARQ) genotype, the levels of cholesterol esters were consistently higher than in tissues and cultures derived from animals with a scrapie-resistant (ARR/ARR) genotype. Moreover, both uninfected and scrapie-affected ARQ/ARQ sheep showed abnormally low levels of high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) in their plasma, as compared to ARR/ARR animals. We now show that intracellular accumulation of cholesterol esters in fibroblasts derived from scrapie-susceptible sheep was accompanied by parallel alterations in the expression level of genes and gene products (ACAT1 and Cav-1) that are involved in the pathways leading to intracellular cholesterol esterification and trafficking. Comparative analysis of PrPc mRNA, showed an higher expression level in cells from animals carrying susceptible genotype, with or without Scrapie. Preliminary experiments also revealed the presence of PK-resistant PrP isoforms in the latter cultures.

Maximum induction of NOR1 by 8-bromo-cAMP was much greater than with LPS, but maximum induction of Nur77 was similar with both agents. Whereas Nurr1 mRNA had very little response to LPS, it was strongly induced by 8-bromo-cAMP, and Nurr1 mRNA levels remained elevated for at least 20 h. The combination of 8-bromo-cAMP and LPS acted synergistically to strongly induce NOR1 and Nur77, whereas LPS partially inhibited the induction of Nurr1 by 8-bromo-cAMP. Nurr1 protein levels correlated with Nurr1 mRNA levels but exhibited slower response kinetics. In summary, the NR4A receptors did not respond identically to individual stimuli or to combinations of stimuli.

We found that the amplitude to food click was significantly greater that the amplitude to the target tone that cued lever insertion. Since the food click is more proximal to the primary reinforcer than the lever tone, it is a stronger conditioned reinforcer than the lever tone that sets the occasion for the food click.

Although NFB is being evaluated as a novel tool for treating brain disorders, evidence is scarce on the mechanism of its impact on brain function. In this study with 34 healthy participants, we examined whether, during the performance of an attentional auditory oddball task, the functional connectivity strength of distinct fMRI networks would be plastically altered after a 30-min NFB session of alpha-band reduction (n=17) versus a sham-feedback condition (n=17). Our results reveal that compared to sham, NFB induced a specific increase of functional connectivity within the alertness/salience network (dorsal anterior and mid cingulate), which was detectable 30 minutes after termination of training. Crucially, these effects were significantly correlated with reduced mind-wandering \u2018on-task\u2019 and were coupled to NFB-mediated resting state reductions in the alpha-band (8-12 Hz). No such relationships were evident for the sham condition. Although group default-mode network (DMN) connectivity was not significantly altered following NFB, we observed a positive association between modulations of resting alpha amplitude and precuneal connectivity, both correlating positively with frequency of mind-wandering. Our findings demonstrate a temporally direct, plastic impact of NFB on large-scale brain functional networks, and provide promising neurobehavioral evidence supporting its use as a noninvasive tool to modulate brain function in health and disease.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/7060/version/1', [u'Neuroscience'], [u'University of Western Ontario', u'The Mind Research Network, Albuquerque']]

[u'The computational magic of the ventral stream', ['Tomaso Poggio'], u'2012-03-21', u'I argue that the sample complexity of (biological, feedforward) object recognition is mostly due to geometric image transformations and conjecture that a main goal of the ventral stream \u2013 V1, V2, V4 and IT \u2013 is to learn-and-discount image transformations.In the first part of the paper I describe a class of simple and biologically plausible memory-based modules that learn transformations from unsupervised visual experience. The main theorems show that these modules provide (for every object) a signature which is invariant to local affine transformations and approximately invariant for other transformations. I also prove that,in a broad class of hierarchical architectures, signatures remain invariant from layer to layer. The identification of these memory-based modules with complex (and simple) cells in visual areas leads to a theory of invariant recognition for the ventral stream.In the second part, I outline a theory about hierarchical architectures that can learn invariance to transformations. I show that the memory complexity of learning affine transformations is drastically reduced in a hierarchical architecture that factorizes transformations in terms of the subgroup of translations and the subgroups of rotations and scalings. I then show how translations are automatically selected as the only learnable transformations during development by enforcing small apertures \u2013 eg small receptive fields \u2013 in the first layer.In a third part I show that the transformations represented in each area can be optimized in terms of storage and robustness, as a consequence determining the tuning of the neurons in the area, rather independently (under normal conditions) of the statistics of natural images. I describe a model of learning that can be proved to have this property, linking in an elegant way the spectral properties of the signatures with the tuning of receptive fields in different areas. A surprising implication of these theoretical results is that the computational goals and some of the tuning properties of cells in the ventral stream may follow from symmetry properties (in the sense of physics) of the visual world through a process of unsupervised correlational learning, based on Hebbian synapses. In particular, simple and complex cells do not directly care about oriented bars: their tuning is a side effect of their role in translation invariance. Across the whole ventral stream the preferred features reported for neurons in different areas are only a symptom of the invariances computed and represented.The results of each of the three parts stand on their own independently of each other. Together this theory-in-fieri makes several broad predictions, some of which are:-invariance to small transformations in early areas (eg translations in V1) may underly stability of visual perception (suggested by Stu Geman);-each cell\u2019s tuning properties are shaped by visual experience of image transformations during developmental and adult plasticity;-simple cells are likely to be the same population as complex cells, arising from different convergence of the Hebbian learning rule. The input to complex \u201ccomplex\u201d cells are dendritic branches with simple cell properties;-class-specific transformations are learned and represented at the top of the ventral stream hierarchy; thus class-specific modules such as faces, places and possibly body areas should exist in IT;-the type of transformations that are learned from visual experience depend on the size of the receptive fields and thus on the area (layer in the models) \u2013 assuming that the size increases with layers;-the mix of transformations learned in each area influences the tuning properties of the cells oriented bars in V1+V2, radial and spiral patterns in V4 up to class specific tuning in AIT (eg face tuned cells);-features must be discriminative and invariant: invariance to transformations is the primary determinant of the tuning of cortical neurons rather than statistics of natural images.The theory is broadly consistent with the current version of HMAX. It explains it and extend it in terms of unsupervised learning, a broader class of transformation invariance and higher level modules. The goal of this paper is to sketch a comprehensive theory with little regard for mathematical niceties. If the theory turns out to be useful there will be scope for deep mathematics, ranging from group representation tools to wavelet theory to dynamics of learning.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/6117/version/3', [u'Neuroscience'], [u'MIT, BCS, I2, CSAIL, CBCL']]

This is partly due to the difficulty of manipulating levels of neurogenesis without inducing off-target effects, which might also influence behaviour. In addition, the analytical methods typically used do not directly test whether neurogenesis mediates the effect of an intervention on behaviour. Previous studies may have incorrectly attributed changes in behavioural performance to neurogenesis because the role of known (or unknown) neurogenesis-independent mechanisms were not formally taken into consideration during the analysis. Causal models can tease apart complex causal relationships and were used to demonstrate that the effect of exercise on pattern separation is via neurogenesis-independent mechanisms. Many studies in the neurogenesis literature would benefit from the use of statistical methods that can separate neurogenesis-dependent from neurogenesis-independent effects on behaviour.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/6988/version/1', [u'Neuroscience'], [u'F.

We present a normative theory in which these persistent effects reflect optimal adaptation to a dynamic environment exhibiting varying rates of change.

[u'Neural Information Processing: between synchrony and chaos', ['Josep  L. Rossello', 'Vincent Canals', 'Antoni Morro'], u'2012-02-25', u'The brain is characterized by performing many different processing tasks ranging from elaborate processes such as pattern recognition, memory or decision-making to more simple functionalities such as linear filtering in image processing. Understanding the mechanisms by which the brain is able to produce such a different range of cortical operations remains a fundamental problem in neuroscience. Some recent empirical and theoretical results support the notion that the brain is naturally poised between ordered and chaotic states. As the largest number of metastable states exists at a point near the transition, the brain therefore has access to a larger repertoire of behaviours. Consequently, it is of high interest to know which type of processing can be associated with both ordered and disordered states. Here we show an explanation of which processes are related to chaotic and synchronized states based on the study of in-silico implementation of biologically plausible neural systems. The measurements obtained reveal that synchronized cells (that can be understood as ordered states of the brain) are related to non-linear computations, while uncorrelated neural ensembles are excellent information transmission systems that are able to implement linear transformations (as the realization of convolution products) and to parallelize neural processes. From these results we propose a plausible meaning for Hebbian and non-Hebbian learning rules as those biophysical mechanisms by which the brain creates ordered or chaotic ensembles depending on the desired functionality. The measurements that we obtain from the hardware implementation of different neural systems endorse the fact that the brain is working with two different states, ordered and chaotic, with complementary functionalities that imply non-linear processing (synchronized states) and information transmission and convolution (chaotic states).

The typical ON, OFF and ON-OFF bipolar cells simultaneously abstracted vectors from green flash stimulus with sine-like functions on their dendritic plane. Atypical bipolar cell had the synchronously monopolar response in contrast to the bipolar responses of typical bipolar cells, they also annotated green flash with facilitated stochastic (asynchronous and rate-coded) responses. Some complex ON-OFF bipolar cells with large voltage-gated Na+ current could generate high-frequent asynchronous responses, others had synchronous ON-OFF responses to green flash. The green flash was synchronously and asynchronously represented by the multiple-dimension signaling space among the parallel bipolar pathways.

[u'Synaptic state matching: a dynamical architecture for predictive internal representation and feature perception', ['Saeed Tavazoie'], u'2012-01-11', u'Here we consider the possibility that a fundamental function of sensory cortex is the generation of an internal simulation of sensory environment in real-time. A logical elaboration of this idea leads to a dynamical neural architecture that oscillates between two fundamental network states, one driven by external input, and the other by recurrent synaptic drive in the absence of sensory input. Synaptic strength is modified by a proposed synaptic state matching (SSM) process that ensures equivalence of spike statistics between the two network states. Remarkably, SSM, operating locally at individual synapses, generates accurate and stable network-level predictive internal representations, enabling pattern completion and unsupervised feature detection from noisy sensory input. SSM is a biologically plausible substrate for learning and memory because it brings together sequence learning, feature detection, synaptic homeostasis, and network oscillations under a single parsimonious computational framework.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/6282/version/2', [u'Neuroscience'], [u'Columbia University']]

Mice receiving i.p. injections of cocaine saw a short lived (1-5 days) decrease in GABAb mediated G-protein coupled inwardly-rectifying potassium (GIRK) currents in DA neurons in the VTA. This decrease parallels an NMDA-mediated increase in the frequency of glutamatergic neurotransmission. Chronic cocaine injections had no additional effects beyond those seen with single injections. Though they found no change in mRNA levels for GABAb receptors, GIRK channels, or RGS-2 (a G-protein regulator), immunoelectron microscopy indicated a decrease in levels of GIRK channels in the plasma membrane of the dendrites of VTA DA neurons. The cocaine-mediated decrease in GIRK currents was abolished in the presence of D2/3R antagonist sulpiride, but not in the presence of D1/5 antagonist SCH23390, indicating a link between D2/3 receptor activation and GIRK activity.

Methods:Our multi-age and multi-language social Network Test implies the two stages, first the subject must order figures of human faces in order of preference, next, the software provides him with different pairs of figures which the subject must fulfill in order to built the intermediate arrays that he believe to interconnect the original pair.

Results:The tendency to produce reorders that are consonant to the one produced in the initial phase increases with age.

Methodology/Principal Findings: The serotonergic genes were the Tph2, Sert, Maoa and Htr1a. The Bdnf, Creb, Cphn, Gapdh, Hprt, B2M, 18S and Actb genes were also studied. The experimental groups were composed of male mice with experience of defeats in 21 daily encounters and male mice with the same track record of defeats followed by a no-defeat period without agonistic interactions (relative rest for 14 days). It has been shown that mRNA levels of the Tph2, Maoa, Sert, Htr1a, Bdnf and Creb genes in the raphe nuclei of defeated mice are decreased as compared with the controls. Under CSDS the Cphn, Gapdh, Hprt, B2M, 18S, Actb genes are also down-regulated. The expression of the serotonergic genes as well as the Cphn and Creb genes is not restored to the control level after the 2 weeks of relative rest. mRNA levels of other genes are not recovered to the control levels, although some up-regulation was observed in rested losers. Significant positive correlations were found between the total time of avoidance behavior demonstrated by the 21-day defeaters in agonistic interactions and Sert, Maoa, Bdnf, Gapdh and 18S mRNA levels. Conclusions: CSDS experience inducing the development of mixed anxious/depression-like state in male mice down-regulates the serotonergic genes expression associated with the synthesis, inactivation and reception of serotonin. The Bdnf and Creb genes as well as the cell and metabolic Cphn, Gapdh, Hprt, B2M, Actb and 18S genes in the midbrain raphe nuclei are also down-regulated under CSDS. Period of relative rest is not enough for most genes to recover expression to the control levels.

Antidepressant medications like desipramine (DMI) inhibit rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep but it is little understood how antidepressant treatments affect learning. We found that DMI strongly suppressed REM sleep in rats for several hours and impaired reconsolidation of a familiar maze and consolidation of moved baited positions (reversal learning) in a sleep-dependent fashion. Unexpectedly, DMI also reduced the spindle-rich transition-to-REM sleep state (TR) and spatial memory changes were more related to TR than to REM sleep. Working memory was unaffected, but overnight reference memory was significantly impaired and subjects increased reliance on non-hippocampal strategies. Procedural memory performance was positively correlated with increases in non-REM sleep after DMI serving to offset memory declines, partially preserving performance. Our results suggest that familiar memories are re-consolidated during REM sleep, reversal memories consolidated during TR, and procedural memories consolidated during non-REM sleep.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/6524/version/1', [u'Neuroscience'], [u'Exosome Diagnostics', u'University of Michigan, Psychology', u'University of Michigan, Anesthesiology', u'University of Michigan Medical School, Department of Anesthesiology and Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology']]
[u'Biophysical Mechanisms Supporting Conscious Perception: Prospects for an Artificial Astrocyte', ['Alfredo Pereira Jr'], u'2011-10-02', u'In perceptual processes, signals carrying information about a stimulus are transmitted through multiple processing lines to populations of receptive neurons and thalamocortical circuits, leading to the formation of a spatial ensemble of local field potentials. This paper addresses the problem of how the brain integrates patterns embodied in local fields to (re)construct the stimulus in a conscious episode. Four examples of human perception are given to illustrate the requirements of the integrative process. Considering the strategic position of astrocytes, mediating somatic signals carried by blood flow and information carried by the neuronal network, as well as their intrinsic information processing capabilities, these cells are in an adequate condition to integrate spatially distributed information. The amplitude-modulated calcium waveform in astrocytes is a multiscale phenomenon, simultaneously operating on temporal scales of milliseconds and seconds, as well as in micro and macro spatial scales. Oscillatory synchrony, constructive wave interference and communication by means of ionic antennas are proposed to constitute a neuro-astroglial self-organizing mechanism of perceptual integration and feeling of the integrated information content. A pilot experiment of a single artificial astrocyte is suggested, both as a test for the hypothesis of astroglial information integration and a multimedia technological application of the model.

Remarkably however, only a handful of studies have investigated human motor reactions to emotional activation as a direct index of physical approximation or withdrawal. Given the inconclusive results of these studies, the approach-avoidance distinction, one of the most salient concepts in human motivational research, remains a broadly exploited hypothesis that has never been empirically demonstrated. Here, we investigate postural responses elicited by discrete emotional stimuli in healthy young adults. We discover that both positive and negative affective pictures induce a significant posterior deviation from postural baseline equilibrium. Further, we find that neutral pictures also evoke posterior deviation, although with a less pronounced amplitude. Exploring the dynamical evolution of postural responses to emotional pictures at high temporal resolution, we uncover a characteristic profile that remains stable for stimuli from all three affective categories. In contrast, the postural response amplitude is modulated by the emotional content of the stimulus. Our observations do not support the interpretation of postural responses to affective picture-viewing as approach-avoidance behavior.

Calbindin-D28k (calbindin) interacts with IMPase enhancing its activity. In the present study in silico modeling of IMPase-calbindin binding using the program MolFit indicated that the 55-66 amino acid segment of IMPase anchors calbindin via Lys59 and Lys61 with a glutamate in between (Lys-Glu-Lys motif). The model further suggested that the Lys-Glu-Lys motif interacts with residues Asp24 and Asp26 of calbindin. Indeed, we found that differently from wildtype calbindin, IMPase was not activated by mutated calbindin in which Asp24 and Asp26 were replaced by alanine. Calbindin&apos;s effect was significantly reduced by a peptide with the sequence of amino acids 58-63 of IMPase (peptide 1) and by six amino-acid peptides including at least part of the Lys-Glu-Lys motif.

The metabolite of chlorpyrifos, chlorpyrifos oxon, is a potent irreversible inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase, much like the nerve agent Sarin. To date, the target brain region(s) most susceptible to the neuroactive effects of chlorpyrifos oxon have yet to be identified. To address this we tested ability of chlorpyrifos oxon to influence neuronal excitability and induce lasting changes in the locus coeruleus, a brain region implicated in anxiety, substance use, attention and emotional response to stress. Here we used an ex vivo rodent model to identify a dramatic effect of chlorpyrifos oxon on locus coeruleus noradrenergic neuronal activity. Prolonged exposure to chlorpyrifos oxon caused acute inhibition and a lasting rebound excitatory state expressed after days of exposure and subsequent withdrawal.

Cooper'], u'2011-08-19', u'Behavioral control over stressful stimuli induces resilience to future conditions when control is lacking. The medial prefrontal cortex(mPFC) is a critically important brain region required for plasticity of stress resilience. We found that control over stress induces plasticity of the intrinsic voltage-gated conductances of pyramidal neurons in the PFC. To gain insight into the underlying biophysical mechanisms of this plasticity we used the conductance- based neural simulation software tool, NEURON, to model the increase in membrane excitability associated with resilience to stress. A ball and stick multicompartment conductance-based model was used to realistically fit passive and active data traces from prototypical pyramidal neurons in neurons in rats with control over tail shock stress and those lacking control. The results indicate that the plasticity of membrane excitability associated with control over stress can be attributed to an increase in Na+ and Ca2+ T-type conductances and an increase in the leak conductance. Using simulated dendritic synaptic inputs we observed an increase in excitatory postsynaptic summation and amplification resulting in elevated action potential output. This realistic simulation suggests that control over stress enhances the output of the PFC and offers specific testable hypotheses to guide future electrophysiological mechanistic studies in animal models of resilience and vulnerability to stress.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/6267/version/1', [u'Neuroscience'], [u'Center for Neuroscience, Department of Neuroscience, University of Colorado at Boulder, Institute for Behavioral Genetics Boulder Colorado 80303, USA']]

Neurons with similar stimulus preferences tend to have higher noise correlations than others. In homogeneous populations of neurons this limited range correlation structure is highly detrimental to the accuracy of a population code. Therefore, reduced spike count correlations under attention, after adaptation or after learning have been interpreted as evidence for a more efficient population code. Here we analyze the role of limited range correlations in more realistic, heterogeneous population models. We use Fisher information and maximum likelihood decoding to show that reduced correlations do not necessarily improve encoding accuracy. In fact, in populations with more than a few hundred neurons, increasing the level of limited range correlations can substantially improve encoding accuracy. We found that this improvement results from a decrease in noise entropy that is associated with increasing correlations if the marginal distributions are unchanged. Surprisingly, for constant noise entropy and in the limit of large populations the encoding accuracy is independent of both structure and magnitude of noise correlations.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/6170/version/1', [u'Neuroscience'], [u'Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics, T\xfcbingen, Germany', u'Baylor College of Neuroscience, Houston, TX, USA']]

However, it is not established whether HA is involved in the AD pathogenesis in humans. We investigated the relationship between urinary HA levels and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores in patients with AD (n = 110, normal =22, AD=88) and found a positive, statistically significant relationship between the two variables (r = 0.39, p =0.00003, n = 110). This relationship was stronger in females. (r = 0.47, p = 0.00008, n = 65 in females; r = 0.39, p = 0.02, n =45 in males). The difference in the urinary HA level between normal and AD females was statistically significant (normal:18.4 + 10.6vsAD: 9.1 + 7.2 mM,p<0.01), but this difference in males was not statistically significant. (normal:12.7 + 6 vs AD8.8 + 7.8). Smoking, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus decreased urinary HA excretion. On the basis of these results, we showed that HA is usually excreted into urine in humans and did not affect brain function in normal individuals. However, when urinary HA excretion was decreased, HA was shown to damage brain function, particularly cognitive ability. To confirm our hypothesis, that is, when urinary HA is suppressed to be excreted into urine, the blood HA level will increase, we examined the relationship between the urinary HA level and blood HA level in 19 patients. The result was shown that the negative statistically significant relationship between them was observed (r=-0.6, p=0.007, n=19). From this result, the uremic encephalopathy of HA toxicity was confirmed. However there remains the question of how the blood HA affected the brain\u2019s cognitive function. The direct effect of green tea leaves ingestion on HA level and MMSE score were also observed. Ingested green tea leaves decreased HA level in blood and concomitantly increased MMSE score, suggesting that blood HA could affect cognitive function. But How?

[u'Maximizing decision rate in multisensory integration', ['Jan Drugowitsch', 'Alexandre Pouget', 'Gregory C. DeAngelis', 'Dora E. Angelaki'], u'2011-03-21', u'Effective decision-making in an uncertain world requires making use of all available information, even if distributed across different sensory modalities, as well as trading off the speed of a decision with its accuracy. In tasks with a fixed stimulus presentation time, animal and human subjects have previously been shown to combine information from several modalities in a statistically optimal manner. Furthermore, for easily discriminable stimuli and under the assumption that reaction times result from a race-to-threshold mechanism, multimodal reaction times are typically faster than predicted from unimodal conditions when assuming independent (parallel) races for each modality. However, due to a lack of adequate ideal observer models, it has remained unclear whether subjects perform optimal cue combination when they are allowed to choose their response times freely.Based on data collected from human subjects performing a visual/vestibular heading discrimination task, we show that the subjects exhibit worse discrimination performance in the multimodal condition than predicted by standard cue combination criteria, which relate multimodal discrimination performance to sensitivity in the unimodal conditions. Furthermore, multimodal reaction times are slower than those predicted by a parallel race model, opposite to what is commonly observed for easily discriminable stimuli.Despite violating the standard criteria for optimal cue combination, we show that subjects still accumulate evidence optimally across time and cues, even when the strength of the evidence varies with time. Additionally, subjects adjust their decision bounds, controlling the trade-off between speed and accuracy of a decision, such that they feature correct decision rates close to the maximum achievable value.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/5822/version/1', [u'Neuroscience'], [u'\xc9cole Normale Sup\xe9rieure', u'University of Rochester', u'Washington University']]

However, it is here estimated that at the population level there are more non-dyslexic individuals than dyslexic individuals with visuo-spatial attention deficits. The reason for this is that in the overall population level there are far more individuals without dyslexia than with dyslexia. Thus, a relatively modest percentage presence of attention problems in the non-dyslexic population can result in a greater absolute number of on-dyslexic individuals with such problems.

In contrast, population codes optimized for Fisher information do not depend on decoding time and are severely suboptimal when only few spikes are available. In addition, we use the neurometric functions of the ideal observer in the classification task to investigate the differential coding properties of these Fisher-optimal codes for fine and coarse discrimination.

Translated into significant changes of endogenous electric field, this dysfunction acts at fundamental level of charge dynamics and leads to chaotic diffusion and electrical resonances within clustered regions with high frequency oscillations (HFO). Since the altered regulation can be modeled by perturbed Hamiltonian systems with many degrees of freedom that describe the motion of charged particles in electric field, the Kolmogorov Arnold Moser theory (KAM) provides a physical model for the mechanism of epileptogenesis.

Contrary to this common belief, spike directivity, a new measure that quantifies transient charge density dynamics within action potentials (APs) provides better results in discriminating different categories of visual object recognition. Specifically, intracranial recordings from medial temporal lobe (MTL) of epileptic patients have been analyzed using firing rate, interspike intervals and spike directivity. A comparative statistical analysis of the same spikes from four selected neurons shows that electrical micro-mapped features in neurons display higher separability to input images compared to spike timing features. If the observation vector include data from all 4 neurons then the comparative analysis shows a highly significant separation between categories for spike directivity (p=0.0023) and does not display separability for ISI (p=0.3768) and firing rate (p=0.5492). The presence of electrical micro-maps within APs suggests the existence of an intrinsic \u201cneural code\u201d where information regarding input images is electrically written/coded and read/decoded during AP propagation in the neuron. The occurrence of electrical micro-maps within APs reflects information communication and computation in analyzed neuron within a millisecond-level time domain of AP occurrence.

Behavioral results from novelty suppressed feeding and force swim tests, as well as direct circuitry measures with manganese enhanced MRI indicate (i) depressive-like behavior and reduced raphe nuclei connectivity/excitability in unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine injected rats, (ii) partial normalization of behavior and raphe connectivity after apomorphine treatment, and (iii) normalization of behavior after bilateral lesion of the habenula.

[u'Motor fluency shapes abstract concepts', ['Daniel Casasanto', 'Evangelia Chrysikou'], u'2010-08-23', u'People with different types of bodies tend to think differently in predictable ways, even about abstract ideas that seem far removed from bodily experience. Right- and left-handers implicitly associate positive ideas like goodness and honesty more strongly with their dominant side of space, the side on which they can interact with their environment more fluently, and negative ideas with their non-dominant side. This suggests a role for motor experience in shaping abstract thoughts. Yet, previous evidence is also consistent with an experience-independent account. Here we show that right-handers\u2019 tendency to associate \u2018good\u2019 with right and \u2018bad\u2019 with left can be reversed due to both long- and short-term changes in motor fluency. Among stroke patients who were right-handed prior to unilateral cerebrovascular accident (CVA), those with left-hemiparesis (following right CVA) associated good with right, but those with right-hemiparesis (following left CVA) associated good with left, like natural left-handers. A similar pattern was found in healthy right-handers whose right or left hand was temporarily handicapped in a laboratory training task.

[u'From Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) signals to brain temperature maps', ['Roberto C Sotero', 'Yasser Iturria-Medina'], u'2010-08-13', u'A theoretical framework is presented for converting Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) images to temperature maps, based on the idea that disproportional local changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) as compared with cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2) during functional brain activity, lead to both brain temperature changes and the BOLD effect. Using an oxygen limitation model and a BOLD signal model we obtain a transcendental equation relating CBF and CMRO2 changes with the corresponding BOLD signal, which is solved in terms of the Lambert W function. Inserting this result in the dynamic bio-heat equation describing the rate of temperature changes in the brain, we obtain a non autonomous ordinary differential equation that depends on the BOLD response, which is solved numerically for each brain voxel. In order to test the method, temperature maps obtained from a real BOLD dataset are calculated showing temperature variations in the range: (-0.15, 0.1) which is consistent with experimental results. The method could find potential clinical uses as it is an improvement over conventional methods which require invasive probes and can record only few locations simultaneously. Interestingly, the statistical analysis revealed that significant temperature variations are more localized than BOLD activations. This seems to exclude the use of temperature maps for mapping neuronal activity as areas where it is well known that electrical activity occurs (such as V5 bilaterally) are not activated in the obtained maps. But it also opens questions about the nature of the information processing and the underlying vascular network in visual areas that give rise to this result.

[u'City rats: From rat behaviour to human spatial cognition in urban environments', ['David Eilam', 'Juval Portugali', 'Osnat Yaski'], u'2010-08-11', u'The structure and shape of an urban environment influence our ability to find our way about in the city1-2. Indeed, urban designers who face the challenge of planning environments that facilitate wayfinding3, have a consequent need to understand the relations between the urban environment and spatial cognition4. Previous studies have suggested that certain qualities of city elements, such as a distinct contrast with the background (e.g. The Eiffel Tower in Paris), or a clear morphology (e.g. the grid layout of Manhattan\u2019s streets) affect spatial behaviour and cognition1,5-7. However, only a few empirical studies have examined the relations between the urban environment and spatial cognition. Here we suggest that testing rats in experimental environments that simulate certain facets of urban environment can provide an insight into human spatial behaviour in urban environments with a similar layout. Specifically, we simulated two city layouts: (1) a grid street layout such as that of Manhattan; and (2) an irregular street layout such as that of Jerusalem. We found that the rats that were tested in the grid layout covered more ground and visited more locations, compared with the restricted movement demonstrated by the rats tested in the irregular layout. This finding in rats is in accordance with previous findings that urban grids conduce to high movement flow throughout the city, compared to low movement flow in irregular urban layouts8-9. Previous studies revealed that the spatial behaviour of rats and humans is controlled by the same underlying mechanisms10-11. In the same vein, we show that rats demonstrate spatial movement patterns that recall those of humans in similar urban environments. Rat behaviour may thus offer an in-vivo means for testing and analyzing the spatial cognitive principles of specific urban designs and for inferring how humans may perceive a particular urban environment and orient in it.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/4759/version/1', [u'Neuroscience'], [u'Tel-Aviv University, Zoology', u'Tel-Aviv University, Geography and the Human Environment']]

[u'Intrinsic Activity in the Fly Brain Gates Visual Information during Behavioral Choices', ['Shiming Tang', 'Mikko Juusola'], u'2010-04-02', u'The small insect brain is often described as an input/output system that executes reflex-like behaviours. It can also initiate neural activity and behaviours intrinsically, seen as spontaneous behaviours, different arousal states and sleep. However, little is known about how intrinsic activity in neural circuits affects sensory information processing in the insect brain and variability in behaviour. Here, by simultaneously monitoring Drosophila\u2019s behavioural choices and brain activity in a flight simulator system, we identify intrinsic activity that is associated with the act of selecting between visual stimuli. We recorded neural output (multi-unit action potentials and local field potentials) in the left and right optic lobes of a tethered flying Drosophila, while its attempts to follow visual motion (yaw torque) were measured by a torque meter. We show that when facing competing motion stimuli on its left and right, Drosophila generate large torque responses that flip from side to side. The delayed onset (0.1-1 s) and spontaneous switch-like dynamics of these responses make this behaviour different from the classic steering reflexes. Drosophila, thus, seem to choose one stimulus at a time and attempt to rotate toward its direction. With this behaviour, the neural output of the optic lobes alternates; being augmented on the side chosen for body rotation and suppressed on the opposite side, even though the visual input to the fly eyes stays the same. Thus, the flow of information from the fly eyes seems gated intrinsically, with this process highlighting chosen information while ignoring the irrelevant. We propose that in small insect brains of limited capacity, intrinsic activity can play an important role in modulating neural information processing and behaviour.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/4325/version/1', [u'Neuroscience'], [u'Beijing Normal University', u'University of Sheffield']]

It is possible to think of this type of discoveries as an expression of creativity, i.e. the ability to use existing pieces of information and combine them in novel patterns leading to greater understanding and new solutions. Preliminary support of the role of sleep in creative thinking comes from a recent study by Wagner et al.2; these authors asked normal participants to perform a cognitive task, the Number Reduction Task. In this task, participants are required to understand a set of stimulus-response sequences and supply a single representative numerical answer. Improvement in task performance may be gradual (i.e., by slowly increasing response speed), or abrupt (after insight into an abstract rule underlying all sequences).

The problem is that, because illumination varies from time to time and from place to place, any amount of light can be reflected from any shade of gray. Thus the amount of light reflected by an object, called luminance, says nothing about its lightness. Experts agree that the lightness of a surface can be computed only by using the surrounding context, but they disagree about how the context is used. We have tested an image in which two major classes of theory, contrast theories and frame-of-reference theories, make very different predictions regarding what gray shades will be seen by human observers. We show that when frame-of-reference is varied while contrast is held constant, lightness varies strongly. But when contrast is varied but frame-of-reference is held constant, little or no variation is seen.

[u'Consciousness as Recursive, Spatiotemporal Self-Location', ['Frederic Peters'], u'2009-10-20', u'At the phenomenal level, consciousness can be described as a singular, unified field of recursive self-awareness, consistently coherent in a particular way; that of a subject located both spatially and temporally in an egocentrically-extended domain, such that conscious self-awareness is explicitly characterized by I-ness, now-ness and here-ness. The psychological mechanism underwriting this spatiotemporal self-locatedness and its recursive processing style involves an evolutionary elaboration of the  basic orientative reference frame which consistently structures ongoing spatiotemporal self-location computations as i-here-now. Cognition computes action-output in the midst of ongoing movement, and consequently requires a constant self-locating spatiotemporal reference frame as basis for these computations. Over time, constant evolutionary pressures for energy efficiency have encouraged both the proliferation of anticipative feedforward processing mechansims, and the elaboration, at the apex of the sensorimotor processing hierarchy, of self-activating, highly attenuated recursively-feedforward circuitry processing the basic orientational schema independent of external action output. As the primary reference frame of active waking cognition, this recursive i-here-now processing generates a zone of subjective self-awareness in terms of which it feels like something to be oneself here and now. This is consciousness. ', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/2444/version/2', [u'Neuroscience'], [u'University of Queensland, Australia']]
[u'An offside position in football cannot be detected in zero milliseconds', ['Francisco Belda Maruenda'], u'2009-10-07', u'Errors when judging an offside position in football are very frequent. In the last years, several scientific papers have tried to explain the causes for human errors. When a referee or an assistant referee misjudges an offside position, it is thought to be caused by a human error. A human error means to carry out incorrectly an action we are physiologically qualified for. The hypothesis to be studied in this paper is if when judging an offside position it is possible to attribute errors to humans or to the fact that human physiology and the technical media are not capable of detecting an offside position. The offside rule has to be applied in real time, in zero milliseconds, in the precise moment when the ball is being passed, never 1 millisecond or even 1 millionth of a second later. This paper shows that the human being and the technological media are both physically and technically incapable of detecting an offside position in real time, in zero milliseconds. The results of this study show that when the ball is passed, the human eye and brain and the technological media need some time to locate the at least four players who intervene in an offside position. When those players are located, time has passed and they are never in the original position, when the ball was passed. Football players are trained for speed and acceleration to change their geographical position in the field when the ball is passed. Therefore, we cannot refer to a human error when an offside position is misjudged. The human being and the technological media will never be capable of detecting an offside position in real time, in zero milliseconds. The key of the offside position is a physical problem: time. The IFAB must abolish the offside rule.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/3835/version/1', [u'Neuroscience'], [u'Servicio Murciano de Salud (Murcian Service of Health), Centro de Salud de Alquerias( Alquerias Center of Health)']]

By applying computer graphics and virtual human imaging techniques to human developmental neuroanatomy, this paradox may potentially be explained: acupuncture Principal meridians likely are TCM&apos;s representation of the nervous system.

Effect-sizes on trust and generosity were sufficiently large that OT started to be perceived as a natural drug that would make people credulous. But could OT really impede judgment and lead individuals to trust untrustworthy peers? Here we show that oxytocin makes people trusting, but not gullible. Namely, OT did not have a trust-enhancing effect on people who interacted with seemingly unreliable peers.

On average, rats estimate that cocaine is worth about 10 times less than the alternative reward. Only a small minority of rats prefer to continue taking cocaine when offered the choice. These findings reveal the existence of a genuine resilience to cocaine addiction in the majority of rats, a phenomenon that has long been suspected, though not firmly demonstrated, in humans.

Traditionally, these computations have been characterized as temporally local, near-instantaneous mappings from the current input of the cell to its current output, brought about by somatic summation of dendritic contributions that are generated in spatially localized functional compartments. However, recent evidence about the presence of oscillations in dendrites suggests a qualitatively different mode of operation: the instantaneous phase of such oscillations can depend on a long history of inputs, and under appropriate conditions, even dendritic oscillators that are remote may interact through synchronization. Here, we develop a mathematical framework to analyze the interactions of local dendritic oscillations, and the way these interactions influence single cell computations. Combining weakly coupled oscillator methods with cable theoretic arguments, we derive phase-locking states for multiple oscillating dendritic compartments. We characterize how the phase-locking properties depend on key parameters of the oscillating dendrite: the electrotonic properties of the (active) dendritic segment, and the intrinsic properties of the dendritic oscillators. As a direct consequence, we show how input to the dendrites can modulate phase-locking behavior and hence global dendritic coherence. In turn, dendritic coherence is able to gate the integration and propagation of synaptic signals to the soma, ultimately leading to an effective control of somatic spike generation.

Coupling between theta and gamma oscillations, the theta/gamma ratio and the regularity of theta phase were also increased, but not neuronal firing rates. A neural network model with fast and slow inhibitory interneurons was developed which generated theta nested gamma. By increasing N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor sensitivity similar learning-evoked changes could be produced. The model revealed that altered theta nested gamma could potentiate downstream neuron responses by temporal desynchronization of excitatory neuron output independent of changes in overall firing frequency. This learning-associated desynchronization was also exhibited by inferotemporal cortex neurons. Changes in theta nested gamma may therefore facilitate learning-associated potentiation by temporal modulation of neuronal firing.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/3151/version/2', [u'Neuroscience'], [u'Cognitive and Systems Neuroscience Group, The Babraham Institute', u'Mathematics Department, Zhejiang Normal University', u'Department of Computer Science, University of Warwick']]

Over a 15 year period, these techniques \u2013 MR Neurography and Diffusion Tensor Imaging \u2013 were then deployed in the clinical and research community and applied to about 50,000 patients. Within this group, about 5,000 patients having MR Neurography were carefully tracked on a prospective basis.Method \u2013 In the study group a uniform imaging methodology was applied and all images were reviewed and registered by referral source, clinical indication, efficacy of imaging and quality. Various classes of image findings were identified and subjected to a variety of small targeted prospective outcome studies. Those findings demonstrated to be clinically significant were then tracked in the larger clinical volume data set.Results \u2013 MR Neurography demonstrates mechanical distortion of nerves, hyperintensity consistent with nerve irritation, nerve swelling, discontinuity, relations of nerves to masses, and image features revealing distortion of nerve at entrapment points. These findings are often clinically relevant and warrant full consideration in the diagnostic process. They result in specific pathologic diagnoses that are comparable to electrodiagnostic testing in clinical efficacy.Conclusions \u2013 MR Neurography and DTI neural tract imaging have been validated as indispensable clinical diagnostic methods that provide reliable anatomical pathological information. There is no alternative diagnostic method in many situations.

Some recent study included V1 in the the circuitry of reward-based modulations, but the effects of reward can easily be confused with effects of attention. Here we address this issue with a psychophysical dual task to control attention while orientation sensitivity on targets associated to different levels of reward is measured. We found that different reward rates improve orientation discrimination and sharpen the internal response distributions. Data are unaffected by changing attentional load nor by dissociating the feature of the reward cue from the feature relevant for the task.

This latter effect is especially obvious in addicted individuals and is thought to contribute together with other factors to trigger relapse after abstinence. Cocaine-induced craving can be studied in animals in the drug reinstatement model. In this model, responding for the drug (e.g., pressing a lever) is first extinguished by discontinuing drug reinforcement and then reinstated by drug priming (i.e., non-contingent re-exposure to the drug) or stress. Importantly, during reinstatement testing, responses continue to be unrewarded as during extinction and, therefore, reflect genuine drug seeking. Here we show that reinstatement of cocaine seeking can be rapidly extinguished with daily repeated cocaine priming. The extinction of cocaine seeking fully generalized to stress, another major trigger of drug craving and relapse. These findings suggest that cocaine and stress induce drug craving by generating similar conditioned interoceptive effects.

Under these conditions, neuronal activity in the SCN, assessed by cFos expression, increased only in the light phase. The differences between the phases in Clock mutant mice were less marked.

For that reason, one of the main requirements towards experimental depression models is that they be able to demonstrate anhedonia in animals, that have been exposed to stressful events, and other behavioral changes attributable to a depression-like state. However, the results presented in the literature are contradictory: sweet solution intake, which is considered as a parameter of hedonic/anhedonic behavior in animals, responds quite differently to stressful situations in that it is either unaffected or increased or decreased. Different experimental designs used for the study of anhedonia in male mice exposed to chronic social defeat stress were tried to understand the reasons for so contradictory responses. Anhedonia appears as an abrupt reduction in sweet solution consumption in stressed animals and by failure to attain recovery after deprivation. However, it was also demonstrated that sucrose solution intake and preference strongly depend on the experimental context; that the possible critical factor may be prior acquaintance with the hedonic stimulus \u2013 or the lack whereof. Analysis of literature data and ours allowed us to conclude that the lack of a significant decrease in sweet solution intake in stressed animals is no evidence of lack of depression.

Subjects: 2,414 men and women from the Maastricht region of the Netherlands.Measurements: QoL outcomes were measured by the RAND-36 (eight subscales and two overall composite scores, physical and mental health (PCS and MCS)). Weight was measured on a scale. Weight change was calculated as change in weight between 1998 and 2003. In addition, 5-year weight change was also categorized in three groups: weight losers, weight maintainers, and weight gainers. All analyses were stratified for gender.Results: A total of 598 men (50%) and 646 women (54%) maintained their weight, 177 men (15%) and 163 women (14%) lost more than 2.5 kg, and 410 men (35%) and 379 women (32%) gained more than 2.5 kg. Associations between 5-year weight change and QoL were found for MCS (\u03b2 = 0.13, 95% CI: 0.02|0.24) in women, and PCS (\u03b2 = -0.09, 95% CI: -0.17|-0.00; \u03b2 = -0.10, 95% CI: -0.19|-0.01) in men and women respectively. Moreover, associations between weight change and QoL were most pronounced for women of normal weight and obese men. Furthermore, in both genders, weight gainers showed a greater reduction on all physical components of QoL compared with weight maintainers. However, after 5-years weight gainers and weight losers did not significantly differ from weight maintainers in the mean change of MCS and PCS.Conclusion: Weight gain was inversely associated with the physical domains of QoL in women and obese men. Conversely, in women, weight gain was positively associated with the mental domains of QoL.

Design: Animals were grouped into control and model randomly according to their initial body weight. The control rats fed with standard chow singly and the model rats fed with the standard chow and a high fat (HF) diet simultaneously for 20 weeks. Lee\u2019s index of control was used as the reference of obesity identification. The inducing effect of this method and animals\u2019 eating features were studied. Subjects: 142 weaned male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (body weight: 43.95\xb14.0g). Measurements: Body weight (BW), body length (BL), and food accumulation were measured weekly, and Lee\u2019s index was calculated for obesity evaluation. Results: This modeling process based on human eating feature facilitated the production and evaluation to HF diet, and showed an effective inducing effect. At the end of 14th week, about 51% rats (by Lee\u2019s index) or 70.6% rats (by body weight) developed obesity and all developed fatty liver. Animals\u2019 preference to HF diet was proved to be varied greatly. Its influence on obesity and obesity resistance (OR) rats can be balanced by two-bottle-feeding method, p=0.42. Obesity rats ate more HF diet than OR rats, but they ate same amount of chow. On the other hand, Lee\u2019s index of the animals was not well related to energy intake, r2=0.48. Thus, animal\u2019s preference to HF diet and their own metabolic feature were potential influence factors, except for these factors, animals\u2019 food intake and energy efficiency are key factors deciding obesity.Conclusions: Two-bottle-feeding method is an effective way to modeling nutritional obesity as well as fatty liver in rats.

Within this group, about 5,000 patients having MR Neurography were carefully tracked on a prospective basis.Method: In the study group a uniform imaging methodology was applied and all images were reviewed and registered by referral source, clinical indication, efficacy of imaging and quality. Various classes of image findings were identified and subjected to a variety of small targeted prospective outcome studies. Those findings demonstrated to be clinically significant were then tracked in the larger clinical volume data set.Results: MR Neurography demonstrates mechanical distortion of nerves, hyperintensity consistent with nerve irritation, nerve swelling, discontinuity, relations of nerves to masses, and image features revealing distortion of nerve at entrapment points. These findings are often clinically relevant and warrant full consideration in the diagnostic process. They result in specific pathologic diagnoses that are comparable to electrodiagnostic testing in clinical efficacy.Conclusions: MR Neurography and DTI neural tract imaging have been validated as indispensable clinical diagnostic methods that provide reliable anatomical pathological information.

Each chapter was intended to be self-contained, so they do not have to be read in the order they are presented.  Second chapter (Sec. 2) contains a detailed description of experimental techniques: surgery, recording, and training techniques we used in awake head-fixed rats. We have also included a detailed description of all sets of stimuli we used to probe neurons, analytical methods used to analyze data, and description of computational models used in other parts of the thesis.Third chapter (Sec. 3) focuses on description of single-neuron responses in primary auditory cortex of awake head-fixed rats. The primary emphasis of this part is on the sparse representation of various auditory stimuli we used to probe neurons, and the heterogeneity of responses of single neurons. To characterize population responses to sound in the auditory cortex we asked the question \u201cWhat is the typical response to acoustic stimuli?\u201d instead of what is usually asked \u201cWhat is the stimulus that evokes a response?\u201d We found that the population response was sparse, with many unresponsive neurons. In addition, the responsive neurons showed a great variety of responses. This heterogeneity of neuronal responses (\u201cresponse zoo,\u201d courtesy of Anthony M. Z\xe1dor) was, however, surprisingly well characterized by lognormal distribution of firing rates. The observation that firing rates in awake auditory cortex were lognormally distributed was even more interesting given the observation of lognormal distribution of synaptic weights in the cerebral cortex.The fourth chapter (Sec. 4) focuses on mechanisms which could give rise to lognormal distribution of firing rates, as well as synaptic weights. We proposed specific types of correlations among synaptic connections, and formulated a multiplicative learning rule which led to the observed distributions. We were also able to characterize intracellular activity of neurons in awake auditory cortex. The fifth chapter (Sec. 5) contains analysis of so-called up and down states in awake auditory cortex. We show that up and down states\u2014the \u201csignature\u201d subthreshold dynamics so often described in various cortical areas of anesthetized animals\u2014were rare in the primary auditory cortex of awake rats, instead, subthreshold dynamics was consisted of brief, infrequent fluctuations of membrane potential.The experiments described and analyzed in chapters 2\xad\u20144 were conducted in na\xefve awake rats. As behavior or attention can influence neuronal activity even in primary sensory areas, we developed a setup for head-fixed behavior.

Because we repeatedly observed delayed response time during functional MRI (fMRI), we designed an experiment to confirm this effect and to identify its causal factor(s), including environment, noise, static magnetic field and/or gradient switch. Here we show that the participants had increased response times of +70 ms (up to +30%) in two different detection tasks, with most of this effect due to the 2 Tesla static magnetic field. The latter also specifically accounted for the longer time interval needed to detect two stimuli as occurring successively rather than simultaneously. These observations demonstrate that brain processes are slowed during fMRI, and that this slowing is caused by the static magnetic field. This may be the behavioral counterpart of the effects of static magnetic fields on neuronal excitability. Consequences on fMRI data should be taken into account especially considering the forthcoming very high field MRI.

[u'Neural Mechanisms of Selective Auditory Attention in Rats (Dissertation)', ['Lung-Hao Tai', 'Anthony M. Zador'], u'2008-10-02', u'How does attention modulate sensory representations? In order to probe the underlying neural mechanisms, we established a simple rodent model of modality-specific attention. Rats were trained to perform distinct auditory two-tone discrimination and olfactory odor discrimination in a two alternative choice (2AC) paradigm. To determine auditory cortex\u2019s role in this frequency discrimination task, we used GABA-A receptor agonist muscimol to transiently and reversibly inactivate auditory cortexes bilaterally in rats performing simple interleaved auditory and olfactory discrimination. With olfactory discrimination performance serving as internal control for motivation and decision making capability, we found only auditory two-tone discrimination was selectively impaired in these rats. This shows the auditory cortex is involved in this two-tone discrimination task.To investigate the neural correlate of modality-specific attention in the auditory cortex, we trained rats to perform interleaved auditory and olfactory blocks (of 50~70 trials each) in a single session. In auditory blocks, pure tones were either presented with or without a neutral odor (caproic acid, n=2 and 3 respectively), and subjects were rewarded for discriminating auditory stimuli. In olfactory blocks, both task odors and pure tones were presented simultaneously, and subjects were rewarded for discriminating olfactory stimuli. We recorded neural responses in primary auditory cortex (area A1) in freely moving rats while subjects performed this behavior. Single unit responses to tones were heterogeneous, and included transient, sustained, and suppressed. We found 205 of 802 units recorded responsive to the stimuli we used. Of these 205 units, 18.5% showed modality-specific attentional modulation of the anticipatory activity before tone onset. In addition, we also observed in smaller proportion of units (11.2%) modality-specific attentional modulation of the tone-evoked responses; in most cases, the responses to a particular auditory stimulus was enhanced in the auditory block (or, equivalently, suppressed in the olfactory block). Attention increased choice probability of the population in the auditory block. We have also observed significant behavior choice probability in small proportions of units.

To further determine the pathogenic role of HA in AD, we treated young 3xTg-AD mice with vitamin B6-deficient food for 3 weeks to induce the production of HA in the brain. Concominantly, mice received either saline or anti-HA antibody intraventricularly using a guide cannula every 3 days. Mice received anti-HA antibody significantly rescued cognitive impairment induced by vitamin B6 deficiency. Pathologically, 3-week treatment with vitamin B-6 deficient food resulted in strong neurodegeneration in the hippocampal CA1 zone and decreased hippocampal volume. In contrast, anti-HA antibody treatment attenuated these pathological changes.

This increase of synaptic dopamine may cause neurotoxicity2,3. At least two different mechanisms have been proposed for the development of dopamine-related neurotoxicity: 1) dopamine produces a free radical that may induce cell toxicity2,3 and 2) dopamine reduces glutamate transport at its presynaptic sites to increase synaptic levels of this amino acid4 and augments glutamate transmission by activating dopamine D1 receptors in different areas of the brain5-7. Increase in glutamatergic transmission mediated by the activation on N-methyl dextro-aspartate (NMDA) receptors has been shown to cause excitotoxicity and neuro-degeneration8. Others and we have reported protection against different psychotropic drug-induced neurotoxicity that may be achieved by prior or simultaneous administration of various pharmacological agents. For example, repeated treatment of rats with haloperidol induced neuronal damage that is ameliorated by prior administration of either GM1 ganglioside9 or the endogenous amino acid, taurine10. Similarly, chronic gestational cocaine exposure causes neurotoxicity that could be prevented by co-administration of clozapine11. To our knowledge, there is no information if chronic cocaine would enhance release of endogenous protective agents that may oppose the over activation of glutamatergic system. Here we show that repeated cocaine treatment increased synaptic levels of the neuroprotective amino acid taurine that opposes the excessive excitatory actions of the glutamatergic system in the rat brain.

Called binocular rivalry, this phenomenon and its deviants have been extensively exploited to study the mechanism and neural correlates of consciousness. In this paper, we propose a framework, the unconscious binding hypothesis, to distinguish unconscious processing from conscious processing. According to this framework, the unconscious mind not only encodes individual features but also temporally binds distributed features to give rise to cortical representation, but unlike conscious binding, such unconscious binding is fragile. Under this framework, we review evidence from psychophysical and neuroimaging studies, which suggests that: (1) for invisible low level features, prolonged exposure to visual pattern and simple translational motion can alter the appearance of subsequent visible features (i.e. adaptation); for invisible high level features, although complex spiral motion cannot produce adaptation, nor can objects/words enhance subsequent processing of related stimuli (i.e. priming), images of tools can nevertheless activate the dorsal pathway; and (2) although invisible central cues cannot orient attention, invisible erotic pictures in the periphery can nevertheless guide attention, likely through emotional arousal; reciprocally, the processing of invisible information can be modulated by attention at perceptual and neural levels.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/2246/version/1', [u'Neuroscience'], [u'University of Minnesota']]

Can top-down attention efficiently select the task-relevant dimension (e.g. gender) during face recognition to override interference in the task-irrelevant dimension (e.g. expression)? To address this issue, participants were asked to classify real face images according to gender or expression, which were preceded by other faces (masked priming task) or words (face-word Stroop task). Results show that face classification was 1) affected by the task-relevant but not the task-irrelevant dimension of the preceding faces, and 2) modulated by words depicting the task-relevant but not the task-irrelevant dimension of the face.

Possibilities include acceleration of the head, direct passage of the blast wave via the cranium, and propagation of the blast wave to the brain via a thoracic mechanism.  The hypothesis that the blast pressure wave reaches the brain via a thoracic mechanism is considered in light of ballistic and blast pressure wave research.  Ballistic pressure waves, caused by penetrating ballistic projectiles or ballistic impacts to body armor, can only reach the brain via an internal mechanism and have been shown to cause cerebral effects. Similar effects have been documented when a blast pressure wave has been applied to the whole body or focused on the thorax in animal models. While vagotomy reduces apnea and bradycardia due to ballistic or blast pressure waves, it does not eliminate neural damage in the brain, suggesting that the pressure wave directly affects the brain cells via a thoracic mechanism.

The possibility is unlikely if reasoning is akin to a formal proof in logic.  But, such effects are predicted from the theory that reasoning is a semantic process of envisaging possibilities consistent with the meanings of premises and knowledge. According to the standard \u2018big five\u2019 model of personality, individuals differ in their openness to experience and in their conscientiousness.  Certain inferential problems are ambiguous, e.g., if a pilot falls from a plane without a parachute then the pilot dies; this pilot didn\u2019t die; how come? A deductive response is: the pilot didn\u2019t fall from a plane without a parachute; an inductive response is: the plane was on the ground. Highly conscientious individuals who are also less open to experience should focus on the possibilities consistent with the premises, and tend to make a deduction, whereas those who are open to experience and not very conscientious should go beyond these possibilities, and tend to make an induction.  Here we show that these biases occurred both for stable personality traits and for the same attitudes induced experimentally, either from false feedback about performance in a personality test or from participants\u2019 recall of autobiographical episodes illustrating the required attitudes.

Over the last decades, neuroimaging, neurophysiological and clinical neuropsychological studies have pointed to many different brain areas involved in the processing of time. However, the core neural substrates and the processes accounting for the encoding of duration, which could form a timekeeping mechanism (essentially, a neural clock), are still unknown. Here we present evidence of neurophysiological activity in circumscribed areas of the human brain that is involved in the encoding of duration. Time-activity curves of neural activation derived from event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a time estimation task show that bilateral posterior insula as well as superior temporal and inferior parietal cortices build up activation when individuals are presented with 9 or 18 seconds tone intervals. Since the build up of neuronal activation peaks at the end of the interval, it appears that this accumulator-type activity encodes duration. Because of the close connection between posterior insula and ascending internal body signals, the accumulation of physiological changes in body states might constitute our experience of time.

Here we show that two-dimensional light scattering changes occur through suspensions of osmotically swollen (depolarized) red blood cells, apparently arising from light scattering changes at the less curved, swollen surface of the steep electrochemical gradient coupled with water activity difference across the plasmic membrane. These optical property changes are likely to be relevant to interpretation of photometry or spectroscopy findings of brain tissue in vivo, where neurons are polarizing and depolarizing during brain function.

In the resulting double mutant line, we show exacerbation of selective striatal neuron degeneration.

But in standard reinforcement learning a flip-side becomes apparent. Learning slows down with increasing population size since the global reinforcement becomes less and less related to the performance of any single neuron. We show that, in contrast, learning speeds up with increasing population size if feedback about the populationresponse modulates synaptic plasticity in addition to global reinforcement. The two feedback signals (reinforcement and population-response signal) can be encoded by ambient neurotransmitter concentrations which vary slowly, yielding a fully online plasticity rule where the learning of a stimulus is interleaved with the processing of the subsequent one.

Study participant JP suffered a stroke in 1996, causing major damage to the left hemisphere that impaired aspects of both motor and cognitive function. Pharmaco-MEG analyses revealed robust and persistent pathological theta (4-10Hz) and beta (15-30Hz) oscillations within the lesion penumbra and surrounding cortex. Administration of zolpidem (5mg) reduced the power of pathological theta and beta oscillations in all regions of the lesioned hemisphere. This desynchronizing effect correlated well with zolpidem uptake (occurring approximately 40 minutes after acute administration) and was coincident with marked improvements in cognitive and motor function. Control experiments revealed no effect of placebo, while a structurally unrelated hypnotic, zopiclone, administered at a comparable dose (3.5mg) elicited widespread increases in cortical oscillatory power in the beta (15-30Hz) band without functional improvement. These results suggest that in JP, specific motor and cognitive impairments are related to increased low-frequency oscillatory neuronal network activity.

Activities of antagonist muscle pairs showed co-activation during the second postoperative week, and oscillated coherently at frequencies of 30-46 Hz (gamma-band) by one month postoperatively. Such gamma-band inter-muscular coherence was not observed preoperatively, but became prominent and distributed widely over proximal and distal muscles with the recovery. Neither the gamma-band cortico-muscular coupling (14-30 Hz) observed before lesion, nor a gamma-band oscillation was observed in bilateral motor cortex after lesion.

[u'Synaptic modification and entrained phase are phase dependent in STDP', ['Gang Zhao'], u'2008-05-28', u'Synapse strength can be modified in an activity dependent manner, in which the temporal relationship between pre- and post-synaptic spikes plays a major role. This spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) has profound implications in neural coding, computation and functionality, and this line of research is booming in recent years. Many functional roles of STDP have been put forward. Because the STDP learning curve is strongly nonlinear, initial state may have great impacts on the eventual state of the system. However, this feature has not been explored before. This paper proposes two possible functional roles of STDP by considering the influence of initial state in modeling studies. First, STDP could lead to phase-dependent synaptic modification that have been reported in experiments. Second, rather than leading to a fixed phase relation between pre- and post-synaptic neurons, STDP that includes suppression between the effects of spike pairs lead to a distributed entrained phase which also depend on the initial relative phase. This simple mechanism is proposed here to have the ability to organize temporal firing pattern into dynamic cell assemblies in a probabilistic manner and cause cell assemblies to update in a deterministic manner. It has been demonstrated that olfactory system in locust, and even other sensory systems, adopts the strategy of combining probabilistic cell assemblies with their deterministic update to encode information. These results suggest that STDP rule is a potentially powerful mechanism by which higher network functions emerge.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/1921/version/1', [u'Neuroscience'], [u'Jiangxi Blue Sky University, Institute of Complex Bio-dynamics']]

[u'A Mathematical Model of a Neuron with Synapses based on Physiology', ['Xiaolin Zhang'], u'2008-03-21', u'The neuron, when considered as a signal processing device, itsinputs are the frequency of pulses received at the synapses, and its output is the frequency of action potentials generated- in essence, a neuron is a pulse frequency signal processing device. In comparison, electrical devices use either digital or analog signals for communication or processing, and the mathematics behind these subjects is well understood. However, in regards to pulse frequency processing devices, there has not yet been a clear and persuasive mathematical model to describe the functions of neurons. It goes without saying that such a model is very important, not only for understanding neuron and neural system behavior, but also for undeveloped potential applications in industry. This paper proposes a method for obtaining the mathematical relationship between the input and output signals of a neuron based on physiological facts. The proposed method focuses on the currents across the postsynaptic membrane of each synapse, and the key is to recognize that the net charge across the whole membrane of a neuron over each action potential cycle must equal to zero. By analyzing the relationship between the input of a synapse and the currents across the postsynaptic membranes, a dynamic pulse frequency model of the neuron can be obtained. Here, we show that the transfer function of a neuron depends on the function of thepostsynaptic current of each synapse in resting state, which can be found by detecting the postsynaptic current when a pulse is received at the synapse. The transfer function of a typical neuron generally includes addition and subtraction of feedthrough terms and/or first order lag functions.

[u'Representing an Object by Interchanging What with Where', ['Jong-Hoon Ahn', 'Yillbyung Lee'], u'2008-03-14', u'Exploring representations is a fundamental step towards understanding vision. The visual system carries two types of information along separate pathways: One is about what it is and the other is about where it is. Initially, the what is represented by a pattern of activity that is distributed across millions of photoreceptors, whereas the where is \u2018implicitly\u2019 given as their retinotopic positions. Many computational theories of object recognition rely on such pixel-based representations, but they are insufficient to learn spatial information such as position and size due to the implicit encoding of the where information. Here we try transforming a retinal image of an object into its internal image via interchanging the what with the where, which means that patterns of intensity in internal image describe the spatial information rather than the object information. To be concrete, the retinal image of an object is deformed and turned over into a negative image, in which light areas appear dark and vice versa, and the object\u2019s spatial information is quantified with levels of intensity on borders of that image. Interestingly, the inner part excluding the borders of the internal image shows the position and scale invariance. In order to further understand how the internal image associates the what and where, we examined the internal image of a face which moves or is scaled on the retina. As a result, we found that the internal images form a linear vector space under the object translation and scaling.

We were able to track both the inhibitory and excitatory postsynaptic field activity during the entire latent period, from the time of injury to the occurrence of the first spontaneous epileptic seizure. During this latent period we observe a sustained increase in the firing rate of the excitatory postsynaptic field activity, paired with a subsequent decrease in the firing rate of the inhibitory postsynaptic field activity within the CA1 region of the hippocampus.

Furthermore, when viewing a thick ring after first viewing a thin ring, the thick ring now too appears heterogenous! These effects are also demonstrated with a colored background and backgrounds with more than two regions.

However, underlying mechanisms initiated in early life but affecting adult disease remain undefined. Neurotrophins, including nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), are neurotrophic factors essential in promoting and maintaining differentiation, growth, and survival of central and peripheral nervous system. The goal of this proposal is to examine the potential role of neurotrophin release in mediating long-term effects of prenatal and early postnatal smoke exposure. Our studies showed that an initial exposure to smoke during prenatal and early postnatal periods significantly changed lung function, substance P (SP) innervation in trachea and the level of NGF in BAL fluid after re-exposure to smoke on adult (postnatal day (PD) 60). In controls, smoke exposure (PD 28) with a subsequent re-exposure at PD 60 did not affect lung function or SP innervation or NGF levels. PCR array revealed enhanced expression of multiple genes including NGF and its receptor by smoke exposure only during early prenatal periods. These data suggest that a critical period of exposure exists in early periods of development. Increased expression of NGF and its receptor in airway caused by smoke exposure may enhance susceptibility to respiratory illnesses in adult. These findings have obvious and significant implication both for smoking during pregnancy and the effects of second hand tobacco smoke exposure. The study provides evidence that prenatal and early postnatal life are periods of enhanced susceptibility to detrimental effects of cigarette smoke. These effects appear to be mediated through the release of neurotrophic factors like NGF which regulate growth and maturation of the airway during these susceptible periods.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/1432/version/1', [u'Neuroscience'], [u'West Virginia University, Neurobiology and Anatomy', u'West Virginia University, Orthopaedics']]

The removal or accumulation of information is analyzed in terms of ionic mass transfer related with changes in Shannon information entropy. Specifically, information transfer occurs during an action potential (AP) via the voltage gated ion channels in membranes and the same physical mechanism can be extended to various types of synapses. Since sequential APs from a selected neuron are not alike, then every spike may transfer slightly different amounts of information during their occurrence. The average efficiency in information transfer during APs is estimated using mutual information measures and Hodgkin-Huxley model.

We demonstrate in real experiments with physical robots that such a dynamical system indeed leads to a successful emergent communication system and hence that symbol grounding and intentionality can be explained in terms of a particular kind of system dynamics.

While it is well accepted that concepts are comprised of features related to sensory object attributes, it is still unclear how these features are represented in the brain. Of central interest is whether concepts are essentially grounded in perception. This would imply a common neuroanatomical substrate for perceptual and conceptual processing. Here we show using functional magnetic resonance imaging and recordings of event-related potentials that acoustic conceptual features rapidly recruit auditory areas even when implicitly presented through visual words. Recognizing words denoting objects for which acoustic features are highly relevant (e.g. \u201ctelephone\u201d) suffices to ignite cell assemblies in the posterior superior and middle temporal gyrus (pSTG/MTG) that were also activated by listening to real sounds. Activity in pSTG/MTG had an onset of 150 ms and increased parametrically as a function of acoustic feature relevance. Both findings suggest a conceptual origin of this effect rather than post-conceptual strategies such as imagery. The presently demonstrated link between auditory and conceptual brain systems parallels observations in other memory systems suggesting that modality-specificity represents a general organizational principle in cortical memory representation. The understanding of concepts as a partial reinstatement of brain activity during perception stresses the necessity of rich sensory experiences for concept acquisition.

Surprisingly, orexin neurons were also less responsive to glutamate, apparently because the augmented GABAA receptor-mediated inhibition increases the membrane conductance and shunts excitatory currents. These observations indicate that absence of GABAB receptors decreases the sensitivity of orexin neurons to both excitatory and inhibitory inputs.

The filtered glucose is reabsorbed principally through the sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2), a low affinity transport system, which is present at the luminal surface cells that cover the first segment of proximal tubules. Competitive inhibition of SGLT2 therefore represents an innovative therapeutic strategy for the treatment of hyperglycaemia and/or obesity in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes by enhancing glucose and energy loss through the urine. Selective inhibitors of SGLT2 reduce glucose reabsorption, causing excess glucose to be eliminated in the urine; this decreases plasma glucose. SGLT2 inhibitors are coupled with osmotic dieresis and loss of weight which aid in reducing blood pressure. The observation that individuals with familial renal glycosuria maintain normal long-term kidney function provides some encouragement that this mode of action will not adversely affect renal function.

Up until now, no study was undertaken to appraise the efficacy of \u201cQurs Tabasheer\u201d in the diabetic rats. Qurs Tabasheer is a unani formulation restraining preparations from six various herbs namely Tukhme Khurfa (Portulaca oleracea seed), Gule Surkh (Rosa damascena flower), Gile armani (Arminium bole), Gulnar (Punica granatum flower), Tabasheer (Bambusa arundinasia dried exudate on node), Tukhme Kahu (Lactuca sativa Linn seed). The effect of Qurs Tabasheer was assessed in STZ (60 mg/kg, i.p single shot) induced diabetic wistar rats. STZ produced a marked increase in the serum glucose, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, triglycerides and trimmed down the HDL level. We have weighed the effect of Qurs Tabasheer on hepatic activity through estimating levels of various liver enzymes viz. Hexokinase, Glucose-6-Phosphatase and Fructose-1-6-biphosphatase in STZ diabetic wistar rats. In STZ-induced diabetic wistar rats the level of Hexokinase, and Glucose-6-Phosphatase was decreased to a significant level while the level of fructose-1-6-biphophatase was augmented. Therapy with Qurs Tabasheer for 30 days to STZ-induced diabetic rats significantly reduces the level of serum glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose-6-phosphatase and fructose-1-6-biphosphatase, while magnitude of HDL cholesterol and hexokinase was amplified. Antihyperglycemic, antihyperlipidemic activity of Qurs Tabasheer suspension in STZ- induced wistar rats was found to be more effective than oral hypoglycemic drug Glimepiride.

This study was undertaken to determine whether the botanical drug ALS-L1023 (ALS), which exhibits antiangiogenic activity, can regulate adipose tissue growth in high-fat-diet-induced obese mice.Materials and Methods: The effects of ALS on angiogenesis and extracellular matrix remodeling were measured using in vitro assays. The effects of ALS on adipose tissue growth was investigated in nutritionally obese mice. Results: ALS inhibited angiogenesis in a concentration-dependent manner in the tube formation assay and the VEGF-induced proliferation assay using human umbilical vein endothelial cells. ALS also suppressed matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity in vitro. ALS administration to high-fat-diet-induced obese mice significantly reduced body weight gain, adipose tissue mass, and adipocyte size compared with the findings in the controls. ALS treatment decreased blood vessel density and MMP activity in adipose tissues. ALS reduced the mRNA levels of angiogenic factors (VEGFs and FGF-2) and MMPs (MMP-2 and MMP-9), whereas it increased the mRNA levels of angiogenic inhibitors (TSP-1 and TIMPs) in adipose tissues. Conclusion: These results suggest that in vivo and in vitro treatment with ALS, which has antiangiogenic and MMP inhibitory activities, reduces adipose tissue mass in nutritionally induced obese mice, providing evidence that adipose tissue growth can be regulated by angiogenesis inhibitors.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/6256/version/1', [u'Pharmacology'], [u'Department of Life Sciences, Mokwon University', u'AngioLab Inc.

There are sufficient evidences that "ischemic preconditioning" has surgical applications and afford clinically relevant cardioprotection. Transient occlusion of circumflex artery, renal artery, limb artery or mesenteric artery preconditions the myocardium against ischemia reperfusion injury in case of ischemic heart disease leading to myocardial infraction. Here abdominal aorta was selected to produce RPAC. Four episodes of Ischemia-reperfusion of 5 min each to abdominal aorta produced RPAC by assessment of infract size, LDH and CK. These studies suggest RPAC produced acute (FWOP) and delayed (SWOP) cardioprotective effect. RPAC demonstrated a significant decrease in Ischemia-reperfusion induced release of LDH, CK and extent of myocardial infract size.

Aminoguanidine (150 mg/Kg s.c.), Aminoguanidine (300 mg/Kg s.c.), S-methyl isothiourea (3 mg/Kg i.v.), 1400W (1 mg/Kg i.v.) pretreatment after RPAC produced no significant effect on acute RPAC induced decrease in LDH, CK and infract size, whereas L-NAME (10 mg/Kg i.v.) increased RPAC induced decrease in LDH, CK and infract size. Most interesting observation is in delayed RPAC, where all NOS inhibitors pretreatment attenuate RPAC induced decrease in LDH, CK and infract size.

Using wheat and Arabidopsis seedlings, we investigated the mechanisms of heat-derived damage in the dark and avoidance of damage in the light. Heat treatment at 40oC in the dark caused serious damage to PSII: the maximum quantum yield of PSII (Fv/Fm) and oxygen evolution rapidly decreased. The damage was due to the degradation of the D1 protein (shown by immuno-chemical analysis) and the disturbance of energy transfer in PSII core chlorophyll-binding proteins CP43 and CP47 (shown by time-resolved fluorescence measurement). The damage to PSII might be due to enhanced introduction of electrons from the reducing power of the stroma into thylakoid membranes, causing subsequent electron backflow to PSII. Plants treated at 40oC in the light avoided PSII damage and showed preferential excitation of photosystem I (PSI), phosphorylation and migration of light-harvesting complex II (LHCII), which indicate state transition of the photosystem to enhance thermal dispersion and light-driven cyclic electron flow around PSI. These results suggest that heat damage to PSII is probably due to a backflow of reducing power from the stroma to PSII, and that light causes a state transition of photosystem, driving cyclic electron flow and thus protecting PSII from damage.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/6168/version/1', [u'Plant Biology'], [u'Kobe University, Graduate School of Agricultural Science', u'Kobe University, Organization of Advanced Science and Technology', u'Kobe University, Graduate School of Science', u'Kobe University, Dept.

[u'Crossing Lilium Orientals of different ploidy creates Fusarium-resistant hybrid', ['Zheng Sixiang', 'Wu Hongzhi', 'Zhao Yan', 'Liu Feihu'], u'2010-08-29', u'Oriental hybrid lily is of great commercial value, but it is susceptible to Fusarium disease that causes a significant loss to the production. A diploid Oriental hybrid resistant to Fusarium, Cai-74, was diploidized from triploid obtained from the offspring of tetraploid (from \u2018Star Fighter\u2019) and diploid (\u2018Con Amore\u2019, \u2018Acapulco\u2019) by screening the hybrids of different cross combinations following inoculating Fusarium oxysporum to the tissue cultured plantlets in a greenhouse. By analyzing saponins content in bulbs of a number of lily genotypes with a known Fusarium resistance, it was found that the mutant Cai-74 had a much higher content of saponin than its parents.  Highly resistant wild L. dauricum had the highest level (4.59mg/g), followed by the resistant Cai-74 with 4.01mg/g. The resistant OT cultivars \u2018Conca d\u2019or\u2019 and \u2018Robina\u2019 had a higher saponins content (3.70 mg/g) and 2.83 mg/g, than the susceptible Oriental lily cultivars \u2018Sorbonne\u2019, \u2018Siberia\u2019 and \u2018Tiber\u2019. The hybrid Cai-74 had a different karyotype compared with the normal Lilium Oriental hybrid cultivars. The results suggested that Cai-74 carries a chromosomal variation correlated to Fusarium resistance.

[u'Studies on Endogenous Hormonal Changes during Grain Development in Wheat Genotypes (PhD Thesis)', ['Sridhar Gutam'], u'2010-08-25', u'Pot culture experiment was conducted in the Rabi seasons of 2001 and 2002 in order to study the genotypic differences in grain growth rates and endogenous hormonal contents in the developing grains. The hexaploid new plant types and extant variety and other tetraploids are taken up for the study. The data on yield and yield components show that the tetraploids had higher ear number per plant but lesser number of seeds per ear and lower seed weight per ear. The most important yield component 1000-grain yield was also possessed by hexaploids. The mean plant height was found to be higher in hexaploids over tetraploids in general, and among them DL- 1266-1 and DL-1266-2 (new plant types) recorded higher plant height. Similarly, the ear length was also higher in these new plant types. But, the tiller number/plant and ear number/plant were significantly higher in tetraploids. The new plant types (hexaploids) possessed maximum grain growth rate at 5\u201315 DAA. DL-1266-2 recorded highest grain growth rate 0.093 g/g/day. The photosynthetic rate values show that the hexaploids possessed higher rate than tetraploids. At 7 and 15 DAA, in general, photosynthetic rate was more when compared to 25 DAA and 35 DAA. The results showed that the endogenous hormonal contents in grains during grain development had changed in sequence. At 7 DAA, gibberellic acid (GA3) content was at maximum and at 15 DAA (rapid growth phase), indole-acetic acid (IAA) reached maximum and at 25 DAA (dough stage), ABA was at the maximum. At the 35 DAA, ABA reached all time high and GA3 the least, IAA being intermediate. Among the genotypes, hexaploids recorded higher concentrations of endogenous hormones. The total chlorophyll content in flag leaves of hexaploids was higher than tetraploids. The mean total chlorophyll had increased slightly at 20 DAA when compared to 10 DAA and it decreased at 30 DAA. It appears that the high yielding hexaploids (DL-1266-1 & Dl- 1266-2) by the virtue of possessing more 1000-grain weight and leaf area along with endogenous hormones might be responsible for higher yield as compared to tetraploids. It appears that better photosynthetic rate and better mobilization of photosynthates during grain filling stage contributes for higher yield in hexaploids.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/4821/version/1', [u'Plant Biology'], [u'Indian Agricultural Research Institute']]

However, a new nucleus behavior in interspecific hybrid progenies of Lilium was observed in our experiment. Very unusual behaviors of nuclei surprisingly presented during the mitosis, such as sprouting or germination, tube-like elongation, penetrating cell membrane into a neighbor cell, the top of nuclei tube expanding, intruding and splitting of the tube-like nucleus, and micronucleus formation, and so on. Furthermore, the tetrad of meiosis was founded in mitosis of root.Routine of the unusual nucleus behaviors observed in our experiment may be summarized as nucleus germination\xac\u2014 tube-like elongation\u2014 penetrating cell membrane\u2014 entering a neighbor cell\u2014the top of nuclei tube expanding\u2014tube ingression and splitting\u2014 formation of a new nucleus or micronucleus.Many kinds of abnormal mitosis caused by chemical and physical induction such as unequal division, chromosome bridges, lagging chromosomes, and multiple nuclei have resulted in variations of chromosome number and structure. However, this new nucleus behavior is firstly reported, these phenomena implied that the DNA maybe easily emigrates from one cell to another. Therefore, the unusual behaviors of nuclei in hybrid progenies of Lilium not only create mutations for breeding of new cultivars, also produce possibly ideal materials for exotic DNA or gene transfication with simple method in meristem.

[u'Influence of different iron availability on phosphoenolpiruvate carboxilase and malate dehydrogenase in roots of maize (Zea Mays L.) plants grown under iron deficiency', ['Marco Antonio Russo', 'Adalgisa Belligno'], u'2010-01-25', u'The effect of the different nitrate availability on some enzymatic activities has been evaluated in iron deficient and iron sufficient maize plants (Zea mays L.). In order to evaluate if the induction of sensitive to pH enzymatic activities is affected by the variation of the apoplast reaction due to the different nitrate availability, two experimental tests were done on maize plants grown in nutrient solution with different NO3- availability and with Fe-sufficiency (+Fe) (added with 80 uM Fe(III)-EDTA) and Fe-deficiency (-Fe) (added with 0.1 uM Fe(III)-EDTA).As regards 0.4 mM NO3- (NS2), independently of iron availability, phosphoenolpiruvate carboxilase and malate dehydrogenase inductions are higher than those recorded for the experiment with 4.0 mM NO3-. The two activities, for the reaction determined in citosol by NO3- uptake, show different responses according to Fe availability. In NS1 the higher nitrate uptake and the contemporaneous H+ incoming cause in (+Fe) plants a decrease of PEP-carboxilase activation and, during the first 24 hours, of malate dehydrogenase. The shifting of the peak of maximum activity shows that iron deficiency conditions, interfering with e- transport, determinate a slowing down of the enzyme induction, independently of nitrate availability. In NS2, PEPcase is higher under Fe-deficiency and malate dehydrogenase is higher under Fe-sufficiency, both during the first 24 hours.The different nitrate availability causes a different use of the acid content. In fact, in NS1 citric content, precursor of molecules for the production of phytosiderophores, increased in (-Fe) theses. On the contrary, low nitrate availabilities determined a decrease in acid contents, mostly in (-Fe) theses. This result justifies the higher energy demand to activate membrane carriers under stress conditions for the reduced nitrate availability.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/4175/version/1', [u'Plant Biology'], [u'Department of Agrochemistry, University of Catania, Italy']]

The kernels and kernel meal of J. platyphylla were found to be free of phorbol esters but the kernel meal contained antinutritional factors: trypsin inhibitor, lectins and phytate at levels similar to those in J. curcas kernel meal. However, trypsin inhibitor and lectins are heat labile so this explains why the local people can eat roasted seeds without ill effect. The fatty acid profile of J. platyphylla oil was similar to that of J. curcas and the kernels of both these species contained ca 58% oil. The crude protein content of J. platyphylla kernel meal was 75% against 60% in J. curcas, and the amino acid compositions were similar. All the essential amino acids, except lysine, were more abundant than, or comparable to those, in soybean meal or the FAO Reference protein. Tilapia and other fish species have been found to be particularly sensitive to Jatropha toxins. For this reason they are useful subjects for bioassays. The heated J. platyphylla kernel meal was included in a standard diet (crude protein 36%) for Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) to replace 50% of the fish meal protein. The fish grew as well as those on a control diet in which none of the fish meal was replaced and those on a diet in which 50% of the fish meal protein was replaced by soybean meal.

This intractable phenomenon has been documented both with outdoor field experiments at various latitudes on the eastern seaboard in the USA and in a laboratory, temperature-regulated setting. We now report that an agricultural product, FP, which has been, and is used globally on many commercial crops to increase flower number and strength during blossom formation and development, overcomes the apparent refractory floral initiation and development at high temperatures. This is a new and unexpected finding. Additionally, in another facet of the experiments reported here, the parthenocarpic fruit development potential of FP was tested by eliminating bee pollination. This aspect of the study was addressed in part because of the recent concerns with bee colony collapse disorder. Flower formation, flower development and fruit yield were increased by FP over the bee-pollinated, untreated controls at high temperatures.

The enzymes for the protein storage and starch synthesis pathway should work in concert to carry out the organogenesis of rice endosperm3-5, but the regulatory mechanism is largely unknown. Here we show that a novel regulatory factor, named OsCEO1, acts as the conductor of endosperm organogenesis during the rice grain filling stage. The physiological properties of floury-endosperm-2 (flo2) mutants showed many similarities to symptoms of grains developed under high-temperature conditions, suggesting important roles of the responsible gene in sensitivity to high-temperature stress. Our map-based cloning identified the responsible gene for the flo2 mutant, OsCEO1, which has no homology to any genes of known function. The OsCEO1 belongs to a novel conserved gene family and encodes a protein composed of 1,720 amino acid residues containing a TPR (tetratricopeptide repeat) motif, which is considered to mediate a protein-protein interaction. The yeast two-hybrid analysis raised an unknown protein showing homology to a late embryogenesis abundant protein and a putative basic helix-loop-helix protein as candidates for the direct interactor for OsCEO1, whereas no enzyme genes for the synthesis of storage substances were detected. The flo2 mutant exhibited reduced expression of several genes for putative regulatory proteins as well as many enzymes involved in storage starch and proteins.

[u'Asymmetric development of Cotyledons of Tomato Embryo:  Testing the prediction of Self-Organization ', ['Chalapathy  Reddy'], u'2009-03-27', u'Developmental biologists have long strived to understand how organisms acquire shape and form. The architecture of the mature plant is established during embryogenesis. They have learned much about how gene expression controls the specification of cell type and about how cells interact with one another to coordinate such specific decisions. Far less is known about autocatalytic feedback flow of resource molecules regulating a plant and its parts, shape and form. Indeed, it has even been proposed that the development of shape is not under genetic control but rather is determined by physical forces. Asymmetric development of sinks that depend on common resource pool has been viewed as a consequence of autocatalytic feedback process of flow of resource units into them. The feedback process implies that the stronger a sink is relative to its competitors, the greater is its probability of getting further resources as a non-linear function of its resource drawing ability and sink size. We have shown that this model contrasts with that of sink strength dependent model in its prediction of the subsequent development of the initial asymmetry of growing cotyledons of the tomato embryo (Lycopersicon esculentum L.), when their resource drawing ability is enhanced by exogenous application of the growth regulators (NAA, GA and BA), we test these prediction and show that the results are in conformity with the autocatalytic model proposed by Ganeshaiah and Uma Shaanker.', u'http://precedings.nature.com/documents/2989/version/1', [u'Plant Biology'], [u'Department of Genetics and Plant Breeding']]
