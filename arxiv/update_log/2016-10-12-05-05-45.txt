[u'Is psychosis caused by defective dissociation? An Artificial Life model\n  for schizophrenia', ['Alessandro Fontana'], u'2016-10-11', u'Both neurobiological and environmental factors are known to play a role in\nthe origin of schizophrenia, but no model has been proposed that accounts for\nboth. This work presents a functional model of schizophrenia that merges\npsychodynamic elements with ingredients borrowed from the theory of\npsychological traumas, and evidences the interplay of traumatic experiences and\ndefective mental functions in the pathogenesis of the disorder. Our model\nforesees that dissociation is a standard tool used by the mind to protect\nitself from emotional pain. In case of repeated traumas, the mind learns to\nadopt selective forms of dissociation to avoid pain without losing touch with\nexternal reality. We conjecture that this process is defective in\nschizophrenia, where dissociation is either too weak, giving rise to positive\nsymptoms, or too strong, causing negative symptoms.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03417v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Testing separability and independence of perceptual dimensions with\n  general recognition theory: A tutorial and new R package (grtools)', ['Fabian A. Soto', 'Emily Zheng', 'Johnny Fonseca', 'F. Greg Ashby'], u'2016-10-11', u'Determining whether perceptual properties are processed independently is an\nimportant goal in perceptual science, and tools to test independence should be\nwidely available to experimental researchers. The best analytical tools to test\nfor perceptual independence are provided by General Recognition Theory (GRT), a\nmultidimensional extension of signal detection theory. Unfortunately, there is\ncurrently a lack of software implementing GRT analyses that is ready-to-use by\nexperimental psychologists and neuroscientists with little training in\ncomputational modeling. This paper presents grtools, an R package developed\nwith the explicit aim of providing experimentalists with the ability to perform\nfull GRT analyses using only a couple of command lines. We describe the\nsoftware and provide a practical tutorial on how to perform each of the\nanalyses available in grtools. We also provide advice to researchers on best\npractices for experimental design and interpretation of results.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03207v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Characterizing variability in nonlinear recurrent neuronal networks', ['Guillaume Hennequin', 'Mate Lengyel'], u'2016-10-10', u'In this note, we develop semi-analytical techniques to obtain the full\ncorrelational structure of a stochastic network of nonlinear neurons described\nby rate variables. Under the assumption that pairs of membrane potentials are\njointly Gaussian -- which they tend to be in large networks -- we obtain\ndeterministic equations for the temporal evolution of the mean firing rates and\nthe noise covariance matrix that can be solved straightforwardly given the\nnetwork connectivity. We also obtain spike count statistics such as Fano\nfactors and pairwise correlations, assuming doubly-stochastic action potential\nfiring. Importantly, our theory does not require fluctuations to be small, and\nworks for several biologically motivated, convex single-neuron nonlinearities.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03110v1', ['Neurons and Cognition', 'Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'A Corrected Parsimony Criterion for Reconstructing Phylogenies', ['Yue Zhang'], u'2016-10-11', u'In phylogenetic analysis, for non-molecular data, particularly morphology,\nparsimony optimization is the most commonly employed approach. In the past and\npresent application of the parsimony principle, extra step numbers have been\nadded across different characters without proper justification. This practice,\nhowever, has caused the impacts of characters to be inflated or deflated\nwithout a valid reason. To resolve this methodological deficiency, here I\npresent a corrected parsimony criterion for reconstructing phylogenies. In\nessence, character rather than step is the most fundamental unit. Accordingly,\nthe most parsimonious tree should maximize the sum or average of the\nphylogenetic signals, quantified by retention index, contributed by each\ncharacter. Assigning proper weights to characters is a separate task that\nrequires information other than the intra-character step number changing range.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03217v1', ['Populations and Evolution', 'Quantitative Methods'], []]

[u'On the Global Dynamics of an Electroencephalographic Mean Field Model of\n  the Neocortex', ['Farshad Shirani', 'Wassim M. Haddad', 'Rafael de la Llave'], u'2016-10-11', u'This paper investigates the global dynamics of a mean field model of the\nelectroencephalogram developed by Liley \\emph{et al.}, 2002. The model is\npresented as a system of coupled ordinary and partial differential equations\nwith periodic boundary conditions. Existence, uniqueness, and regularity of\nweak and strong solutions of the model are established in appropriate function\nspaces, and the associated initial-boundary value problems are proved to be\nwell-posed. Sufficient conditions are developed for the phase spaces of the\nmodel to ensure nonnegativity of certain quantities in the model, as required\nby their biophysical interpretation. It is shown that the semigroups of weak\nand strong solution operators possess bounded absorbing sets for the entire\nrange of biophysical values of the parameters of the model. Challenges towards\nestablishing a global attractor for the model are discussed and it is shown\nthat there exist parameter values for which the constructed semidynamical\nsystems do not posses a compact global attractor, due to the lack of\nassymptotic compactness property. Finally, instructive insights provided by the\ntheoretical results of the paper on the computational analysis of the model are\ndiscussed.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03140v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'On the dynamic suction pumping of blood cells in tubular hearts', ['Nicholas A. Battista', 'Andrea N. Lane', 'Laura A. Miller'], u'2016-10-11', u'Around the third week after gestation in embryonic development, the human\nheart consists only of a valvless tube, unlike a fully developed adult heart,\nwhich is multi-chambered. At this stage in development, the heart valves have\nnot formed and so net flow of blood through the heart must be driven by a\ndifferent mechanism. It is hypothesized that there are two possible mechanisms\nthat drive blood flow at this stage - Liebau pumping (dynamic suction pumping\nor valveless pumping) and peristaltic pumping. We implement the immersed\nboundary method with adaptive mesh refinement (IBAMR) to numerically study the\neffect of hematocrit on the circulation around a valveless. Both peristalsis\nand dynamic suction pumping are considered. In the case of dynamic suction\npumping, the heart and circulatory system is simplified as a flexible tube\nattached to a relatively rigid racetrack. For some Womersley number (Wo)\nregimes, there is significant net flow around the racetrack. We find that the\naddition of flexible blood cells does not significantly affect flow rates\nwithin the tube for Wo $\\leq$ 10. On the other hand, peristalsis consistently\ndrives blood around the racetrack for all Wo and for all hematocrit considered.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03427v1', ['Tissues and Organs'], []]
[u'Elastohydrodynamic Synchronization of Adjacent Beating Flagella', ['Raymond E. Goldstein', 'Eric Lauga', 'Adriana I. Pesci', 'Michael R. E. Proctor'], u'2016-10-11', u"It is now well established that nearby beating pairs of eukaryotic flagella\nor cilia typically synchronize in phase. A substantial body of evidence\nsupports the hypothesis that hydrodynamic coupling between the active\nfilaments, combined with waveform compliance, provides a robust mechanism for\nsynchrony. This elastohydrodynamic mechanism has been incorporated into\n`bead-spring' models in which flagella are represented by microspheres tethered\nby radial springs as internal forces drive them about orbits. While these\nlow-dimensional models reproduce the phenomenon of synchrony, their parameters\nare not readily relatable to those of flagella. More realistic models which\nreflect the elasticity of the axonemes and active force generation take the\nform of fourth-order nonlinear PDEs. While computational studies have shown\nsynchrony, the effects of hydrodynamic coupling between nearby filaments\ngoverned by such models have been theoretically examined only in the regime of\ninterflagellar distances $d$ large compared to flagellar length $L$. Yet, in\nmany biological situations $d/L \\ll 1$. Here, we first present an asymptotic\nanalysis of the hydrodynamic coupling between two filaments in the regime $d/L\n\\ll 1$, and find that the form of the coupling is independent of the details of\nthe internal forces that govern the motion of the filaments. The analysis is\nlike the localized induction approximation for vortex filament motion, extended\nto the case of mutual induction. To understand how the coupling mechanism leads\nto synchrony of extended objects, we introduce a heuristic model of flagellar\nbeating, a single fourth-order nonlinear PDE whose form is derived from\nsymmetry considerations, the physics of elasticity, and the overdamped nature\nof the dynamics. Analytical and numerical studies of this model illustrate how\nsynchrony between two filaments is achieved through the asymptotic coupling.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03238v1', ['Cell Behavior'], []]
[u'An Improved Filtering Algorithm for Big Read Datasets', ['Axel Wedemeyer', 'Lasse Kliemann', 'Anand Srivastav', 'Christian Schielke', 'Thorsten B. Reusch', 'Philip Rosenstiel'], u'2016-10-11', u'For single-cell or metagenomic sequencing projects, it is necessary to\nsequence with a very high mean coverage in order to make sure that all parts of\nthe sample DNA get covered by the reads produced. This leads to huge datasets\nwith lots of redundant data. A filtering of this data prior to assembly is\nadvisable. Titus Brown et al. (2012) presented the algorithm Diginorm for this\npurpose, which filters reads based on the abundance of their $k$-mers. We\npresent Bignorm, a faster and quality-conscious read filtering algorithm. An\nimportant new feature is the use of phred quality scores together with a\ndetailed analysis of the $k$-mer counts to decide which reads to keep. With\nrecommended parameters, in terms of median we remove 97.15% of the reads while\nkeeping the mean phred score of the filtered dataset high. Using the SDAdes\nassembler, we produce assemblies of high quality from these filtered datasets\nin a fraction of the time needed for an assembly from the datasets filtered\nwith Diginorm. We conclude that read filtering is a practical method for\nreducing read data and for speeding up the assembly process. Our Bignorm\nalgorithm allows assemblies of competitive quality in comparison to Diginorm,\nwhile being much faster.
