[u'Multivalent co-ions reduce DNA$-$DNA like-charge attraction and enhance\n  DNA overcharging by mutivalent counterions', ['Nguyen Viet Duc', 'Toan T. Nguyen', 'Nguyen Huu Duc'], u'2016-08-05', u'Strongly correlated electrostatics of DNA systems has drawn the interest of\nmany groups, especially the condensation and overcharging of DNA by multivalent\ncounterions. By adding counterions of different valencies and shapes, one can\nenhance or reduce DNA overcharging. In this letter, we focus on the effect of\nmultivalent co-ions, specifically divalent coion such as SO$_4^{2-}$, on the\nstrongly correlated electrostatics of DNA condensation problem. A computational\nexperiment of DNA condensation using Monte$-$Carlo simulation in grand\ncanonical ensemble is carried out where DNA system is in equilibirium with a\nbulk solution containing a mixture of salt of different valency of co-ions.\nCompared to system with purely monovalent co-ions, the influence of divalent\nco-ions shows up in multiple aspects. Divalent co-ions lead to an increase of\nmonovalent salt in the DNA condensate. Because monovalent salts mostly\nparticipate in linear screening of electrostatic interactions in the system,\nmore monovalent salt molecules enter the condensate leads to screening out of\nshort-range DNA$-$DNA like charge attraction and weaker DNA condensation free\nenergy. Additionally, strong repulsions between DNA and divalent co-ions and\namong divalent co-ions themselves leads to a {\\em depletion} of negative ions\nnear DNA surface as compared to the case without divalent co-ions. This leads\nto less screened and stronger electrostatic correlations of divalent\ncounterions condensed on the DNA surface. This in turns results in a stronger\novercharging of DNA by multivalent counterions.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.01912v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'On the Application of Viscoelastic & Viscoplastic Constitutive Relations\n  in the CFD Bio-Fluid Simulations', ['S. M. Javid Mahmoudzadeh Akherat'], u'2016-08-05', u'Considerations on implementation of the stress-strain constitutive relations\napplied in Computational Fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of cardiovascular\nflows have been addressed extensively in the literature. However, the matter is\nyet controversial. The author suggests that the choice of non-Newtonian models\nand the consideration of non-Newtonian assumption versus the Newtonian\nassumption is very application oriented and cannot be solely dependent on the\nvessel size. In the presented work, where a renal disease patient-specific\ngeometry is used, the non-Newtonian effects manifest insignificant, while the\nvessel is considered to be medium to small which, according to the literature,\nsuggest a strict use of non-Newtonian formulation. The insignificance of the\nnon-Newtonian effects specially manifests in Wall Shear Stress (WSS) along the\nwalls of the numerical domain, where the differences between Newtonian\ncalculated WSS and non-Newtonian calculated WSS is barely visible.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.01975v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Possible Explanation for Cancer in Rats due to Cell Phone Radio\n  Frequency Radiation', ['Bernard J. Feldman'], u'2016-07-22', u"Very recently, the National Toxicology Program reported a correlation between\nexposure to whole body 900 MHz radio frequency radiation and cancer in the\nbrains and hearts of Sprague Dawley male rats. Assuming that the National\nToxicology Program is statistically significant, I propose the following\nexplanation for these results. The neurons around the brain and heart form\nclosed electrical circuits and, following Faraday's Law, 900MHz radio frequency\nradiation induces 900 MHz electrical currents in these neural circuits. In\nturn, these 900 MHz currents in the neural circuits generate sufficient\nlocalized heat in the neural cells to shift the equilibrium concentration of\ncarcinogenic radicals to higher levels and thus, to higher incidences of\ncancer.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.01936v1', ['Tissues and Organs'], []]
[u'Sam2bam: High-Performance Framework for NGS Data Preprocessing Tools', ['Takeshi Ogasawara', 'Yinhe Cheng', 'Tzy-Hwa Kathy Tzeng'], u'2016-08-05', u'This paper introduces a high-throughput software tool framework called {\\it\nsam2bam} that enables users to significantly speedup pre-processing for\nnext-generation sequencing data. The sam2bam is especially efficient on\nsingle-node multi-core large-memory systems. It can reduce the runtime of data\npre-processing in marking duplicate reads on a single node system by 156-186x\ncompared with de facto standard tools. The sam2bam consists of parallel\nsoftware components that can fully utilize the multiple processors, available\nmemory, high-bandwidth of storage, and hardware compression accelerators if\navailable.\n  The sam2bam provides file format conversion between well-known genome file\nformats, from SAM to BAM, as a basic feature. Additional features such as\nanalyzing, filtering, and converting the input data are provided by {\\it\nplug-in} tools, e.g., duplicate marking, which can be attached to sam2bam at\nruntime.\n  We demonstrated that sam2bam could significantly reduce the runtime of NGS\ndata pre-processing from about two hours to about one minute for a whole-exome\ndata set on a 16-core single-node system using up to 130 GB of memory. The\nsam2bam could reduce the runtime for whole-genome sequencing data from about 20\nhours to about nine minutes on the same system using up to 711 GB of memory.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.01753v1', ['Genomics'], []]
