Knepley', 'Jaydeep P. Bardhan'], u'2016-11-03', u'We demonstrate that with two small modifications, the popular dielectric\ncontinuum model is capable of predicting, with high accuracy, ion solvation\nthermodynamics in numerous polar solvents, and ion solvation free energies in\nwater--co-solvent mixtures. The first modification involves perturbing the\nmacroscopic dielectric-flux interface condition at the solute--solvent\ninterface with a nonlinear function of the local electric field, giving what we\nhave called a solvation-layer interface condition (SLIC). The second\nmodification is a simple treatment of the microscopic interface potential\n(static potential). We show that the resulting model exhibits high accuracy\nwithout the need for fitting solute atom radii in a state-dependent fashion.\nCompared to experimental results in nine water--co-solvent mixtures, SLIC\npredicts transfer free energies to within 2.5 kJ/mol. The co-solvents include\nboth protic and aprotic species, as well as biologically relevant denaturants\nsuch as urea and dimethylformamide. Furthermore, our results indicate that the\ninterface potential is essential to reproduce entropies and heat capacities.\nThe present work, together with previous studies of SLIC illustrating its\naccuracy for biomolecules in water, indicates it as a promising dielectric\ncontinuum model for accurate predictions of molecular solvation in a wide range\nof conditions.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02150v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Velocity integration in a multilayer neural field model of spatial\n  working memory', ['Daniel B. Poll', 'Zachary P. Kilpatrick'], u'2016-11-07', u'We analyze a multilayer neural field model of spatial working memory,\nfocusing on the impact of interlaminar connectivity, spatial heterogeneity, and\nvelocity inputs. Models of spatial working memory typically employ networks\nthat generate persistent activity via a combination of local excitation and\nlateral inhibition. Our model is comprised of a multilayer set of equations\nthat describes connectivity between neurons in the same and different layers\nusing an integral term. The kernel of this integral term then captures the\nimpact of different interlaminar connection strengths, spatial heterogeneity,\nand velocity input. We begin our analysis by focusing on how interlaminar\nconnectivity shapes the form and stability of (persistent) bump attractor\nsolutions to the model. Subsequently, we derive a low-dimensional approximation\nthat describes how spatial heterogeneity, velocity input, and noise combine to\ndetermine the position of bump solutions. The main impact of spatial\nheterogeneity is to break the translation symmetry of the network, so bumps\nprefer to reside at one of a finite number of local attractors in the domain.\nWith the reduced model in hand, we can then approximate the dynamics of the\nbump position using a continuous time Markov chain model that describes bump\nmotion between local attractors. While heterogeneity reduces the effective\ndiffusion of the bumps, it also disrupts the processing of velocity inputs by\nslowing the velocity-induced propagation of bumps. However, we demonstrate that\nnoise can play a constructive role by promoting bump motion transitions,\nrestoring a mean bump velocity that is close to the input velocity.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02116v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

Reciprocal interactions between superior temporal (STG)\nand inferior frontal gyri (IFG) have been shown to anchor a neural network for\nprosodic comprehension, which we refer to as the Prosody Neural Network (PNN).\nAlthough the amygdala is critical for socio-emotional processing, its integral\nfunctional and structural role in processing social information from speech\nprosody as well as its role in the PNN is largely unexplored including\ninconsistent recent empirical findings. Here, we used magnetoencephalography\nand diffusion magnetic resonance imaging of white-matter pathways to establish\nthat the PNN is characterized by (1) a robust amygdala-cortical functional\nconnectivity that dynamically evolves as prosodic interpretation progresses,\n(2) direct structural fiber connections between amygdala and STG/IFG traversing\na ventral white-matter pathway, and (3) robust amygdala-insula functional\nconnectivity and structural insula fiber projections to arcuate STG-IFG\nconnections.

[u'Representation of uncertainty in deep neural networks through sampling', ['Patrick McClure', 'Nikolaus Kriegeskorte'], u'2016-11-05', u'As deep neural networks (DNNs) are applied to increasingly challenging\nproblems, they will need to be able to represent their own uncertainty.\nModeling uncertainty is one of the key features of Bayesian methods. Scalable\nBayesian DNNs that use dropout-based variational distributions have recently\nbeen proposed. Here we evaluate the ability of Bayesian DNNs trained with\nBernoulli or Gaussian distributions over units (dropout) or weights\n(dropconnect) to represent their own uncertainty at the time of inference\nthrough sampling. We tested how well Bayesian fully connected and convolutional\nDNNs represented their own uncertainty in classifying the MNIST handwritten\ndigits. By adding different levels of Gaussian noise to the test images, we\nassessed how DNNs represented their uncertainty about regions of input space\nnot covered by the training set. Bayesian DNNs estimated their own uncertainty\nmore accurately than traditional DNNs with a softmax output.

[u'An epidemic model for cholera with optimal control treatment', ['Ana P. Lemos-Paiao', 'Cristiana J. Silva', 'Delfim F. M.

In particular, we prove that all solutions of the model are\npositive and bounded; and that every solution with initial conditions in a\ncertain meaningful set remains in that set for all time. The existence of\nunique disease-free and endemic equilibrium points is proved and the basic\nreproduction number is computed. Then, we study the local asymptotic stability\nof these equilibrium points. An optimal control problem is proposed and\nanalyzed, whose goal is to obtain a successful treatment through quarantine. We\nprovide the optimal quarantine strategy for the minimization of the number of\ninfectious individuals and bacteria concentration, as well as the costs\nassociated with the quarantine. Finally, a numerical simulation of the cholera\noutbreak in the Department of Artibonite (Haiti), in 2010, is carried out,\nillustrating the usefulness of the model and its analysis.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02195v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Minimal-assumption inference from population-genomic data', ['Daniel B.

Current methods that take\nadvantage of this linkage information rely on models of recombination and\ncoalescence, limiting the sample sizes and populations that they can analyze.\nWe introduce a method, Minimal-Assumption Genomic Inference of Coalescence\n(MAGIC), that reconstructs key features of the evolutionary history, including\nthe distribution of coalescence times, by integrating information across\ngenomic length scales without using an explicit model of recombination,\ndemography or selection. Using simulated data, we show that MAGIC's performance\nis comparable to PSMC' on single diploid samples generated with standard\ncoalescent and recombination models.

While\nthis effect is limited to the local genomic region of the sweep in panmictic\npopulations, we find that in spatially-extended populations the combined\neffects of many unlinked sweeps can affect patterns of ancestry (and therefore\nneutral genetic diversity) across the whole genome. Even low rates of sweeps\ncan be enough to skew the spatial locations of ancestors such that neutral\nmutations that occur in an individual living outside a small region in the\ncenter of the range have virtually no chance of fixing in the population.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01836v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

[u'Network model of human aging: frailty limits and information measures', ['Spencer Farrell', 'Arnold Mitnitski', 'Kenneth Rockwood', 'Andrew Rutenberg'], u'2016-11-05', u'Aging is associated with the accumulation of damage throughout a persons\nlife. Individual health can be assessed by the Frailty Index (FI). The FI is\ncalculated simply as the proportion $f$ of accumulated age related deficits\nrelative to the total, leading to a theoretical maximum of $f \\leq 1$.\nObservational studies have generally reported a much more stringent bound, with\n$f \\leq f_{max} <1$. The value of $f_{max}$ in observational studies appears to\nbe non-universal, but $f_{max} \\approx 0.7$ is often reported. A previously\ndeveloped network model of individual aging was unable to recover $f_{max}<1$\nwhile retaining the other observed phenomenology of increasing $f$ and\nmortality rates with age. We have developed a computationally accelerated\nnetwork model that also allows us to tune the scale-free network exponent\n$\\alpha$. The network exponent $\\alpha$ significantly affects the growth of\nmortality rates with age. However, we are only able to recover $f_{max}$ by\nalso introducing a deficit sensitivity parameter $1-q$, which is equivalent to\na false-negative rate $q$. Our value of $q=0.3$ is comparable to finite\nsensitivities of age-related deficits with respect to mortality that are often\nreported in the literature. In light of non-zero $q$, we use mutual information\n$I$ to provide a non-parametric measure of the predictive value of the FI with\nrespect to individual mortality. We find that $I$ is only modestly degraded by\n$q<1$, and this degradation is mitigated when increasing number of deficits are\nincluded in the FI. We also find that the information spectrum, i.e. the mutual\ninformation of individual deficits vs connectivity, has an approximately\npower-law dependence that depends on the network exponent $\\alpha$. Mutual\ninformation $I$ is therefore a useful tool for characterizing the network\ntopology of aging populations.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01682v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Amplifiers and Suppressors of Selection for the Moran Process on\n  Undirected Graphs', ['George Giakkoupis'], u'2016-11-05', u'We consider the classic Moran process modeling the spread of genetic\nmutations, as extended to structured populations by Lieberman et al.\\ (Nature,\n2005). In this process, individuals are the vertices of a connected graph $G$.\nInitially, there is a single mutant vertex, chosen uniformly at random. In each\nstep, a random vertex is selected for reproduction with a probability\nproportional to its fitness: mutants have fitness $r>1$, while non-mutants have\nfitness 1. The vertex chosen to reproduce places a copy of itself to a\nuniformly random neighbor in $G$, replacing the individual that was there. The\nprocess ends when the mutation either reaches fixation (i.e., all vertices are\nmutants), or gets extinct. The principal quantity of interest is the\nprobability with which each of the two outcomes occurs.\n  A problem that has received significant attention recently concerns the\nexistence of families of graphs, called strong amplifiers of selection, for\nwhich the fixation probability tends to 1 as the order $n$ of the graph\nincreases, and the existence of strong suppressors of selection, for which this\nprobability tends to 0. For the case of directed graphs, it is known that both\nstrong amplifiers and suppressors exist. For the case of undirected graphs,\nhowever, the problem has remained open, and the general belief has been that\nneither strong amplifiers nor suppressors exist. In this paper we disprove this\nbelief, by providing the first examples of such graphs. The strong amplifier we\npresent has fixation probability $1-\\tilde O(n^{-1/3})$, and the strong\nsuppressor has fixation probability $\\tilde O(n^{-1/4})$. Both graph\nconstructions are surprisingly simple. We also prove a general upper bound of\n$1-\\tilde \\Omega(n^{-1/3})$ on the fixation probability of any undirected\ngraph. Hence, our strong amplifier is existentially optimal.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01585v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'A Markov Decision Process Model to Guide Treatment of Abdominal Aortic\n  Aneurysms', ['Robert Mattila', 'Antti Siika', 'Joy Roy', 'Bo Wahlberg'], u'2016-11-07', u'An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an enlargement of the abdominal aorta\nwhich, if left untreated, can progressively widen and may rupture with fatal\nconsequences. In this paper, we determine an optimal treatment policy using\nMarkov decision process modeling. The policy is optimal with respect to the\nnumber of quality adjusted life-years (QALYs) that are expected to be\naccumulated during the remaining life of a patient. The new policy takes into\naccount factors that are ignored by the current clinical policy (e.g. the\nlife-expectancy and the age-dependent surgical mortality). The resulting\noptimal policy is structurally different from the current policy. In\nparticular, the policy suggests that young patients with small aneurysms should\nundergo surgery. The robustness of the policy structure is demonstrated using\nsimulations. A gain in the number of expected QALYs is shown, which indicates a\npossibility of improved care for patients with AAAs.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02177v1', ['Other'], []]
