[u'Classification of meaningful and meaningless visual objects: a graph similarity approach', ['Ahmad Mheich', 'Mahmoud Hassan', 'Fabrice Wendling'], u'2017-06-02', u'Cognition involves dynamic reconfiguration of functional brain networks at sub-second time scale. A precise tracking of these reconfigurations to categorize visual objects remains elusive. Here, we use dense electroencephalography (EEG) data recorded during naming meaningful (tools, animals) and scrambled objects from 20 healthy subjects. We combine technique for identifying functional brain networks and recently developed algorithm for estimating networks similarity to discriminate between the two categories. First, we showed that dynamic networks of both categories can be segmented into several brain network states (times windows with consistent brain networks) reflecting sequential information processing from object representation to reaction time. Second, using a network similarity algorithm, results showed high intra-category and very low inter-category values. An average accuracy of 76% was obtained at different brain network states.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00603v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'A surrogate function for one-dimensional phylogenetic likelihoods', ['Brian C. Claywell', 'Vu C. Dinh', 'Connor O. McCoy', 'Frederick A. Matsen IV'], u'2017-06-02', u'Phylogenetics has seen an steady increase in substitution model complexity, which requires increasing amounts of computational power to compute likelihoods. This model complexity motivates strategies to approximate the likelihood functions for branch length optimization and Bayesian sampling. In this paper, we develop an approximation to the one-dimensional likelihood function as parametrized by a single branch length. This new method uses a four-parameter surrogate function abstracted from the simplest phylogenetic likelihood function, the binary symmetric model. We show that it offers a surrogate that can be fit over a variety of branch lengths, that it is applicable to a wide variety of models and trees, and that it can be used effectively as a proposal mechanism for Bayesian sampling. The method is implemented as a stand-alone open-source C library for calling from phylogenetics algorithms; it has proven essential for good performance of our online phylogenetic algorithm sts.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00659v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'3D single-cell imaging using combined fluorescence and refractive index tomography', ['Mirjam Schurmann', 'Gheorghe Cojoc', 'Salvatore Girardo', 'Elke Ulbricht', 'Jochen Guck', 'Paul Muller'], u'2017-06-02', u'Cells alter the path of light, a fact that leads to well-known aberrations in single cell or tissue imaging. Optical diffraction tomography (ODT) measures the biophysical property that causes these aberrations, the refractive index (RI). ODT is complementary to fluorescence imaging and does not require any markers. The present study introduces RI and fluorescence tomography with optofluidic rotation (RAFTOR) of suspended cells, quantifying the intracellular RI distribution and colocalizing it with fluorescence in 3D. The technique is validated with cell phantoms and used to confirm a lower nuclear RI for HL60 cells. Furthermore, the nuclear inversion of adult mouse photoreceptor cells is observed in the RI distribution. The applications shown confirm predictions of previous studies and illustrate the potential of RAFTOR to improve our understanding of cells and tissues.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00715v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Origin and Quantitative Control of Sertoli Cells', ['Lixin Feng', 'Yongguang Yang'], u'2017-06-02', u'Sertoli cell is the"nurse"in testes that regulates germ cell proliferation and differentiation. One Sertoli cell supports a certain number of germ cells during these processes. Thus, it is the determinant of male reproductive capability. Sertoli cells originate from the primitive gonads during embryonic stage and their proliferations continue throughout the pre-pubertal stage. The proliferation and final density of Sertoli cells in the testis are regulated by hormones and local factors through autocrine, paracrine as well as endocrine methods. In the concise minireview, the most recent progresses in the study of factors and signaling pathways that participate into regulating the proliferation and function of Sertoli cell were summarized.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00721v1', ['Cell Behavior'], []]
