[u'Symmetry and size of membrane protein polyhedral nanoparticles', ['Di Li', 'Osman Kahraman', 'Christoph A. Haselwandter'], u'2016-11-02', u'In recent experiments [T. Basta et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 111,\n670 (2014)] lipids and membrane proteins were observed to self-assemble into\nmembrane protein polyhedral nanoparticles (MPPNs) with a well-defined\npolyhedral protein arrangement and characteristic size. We develop a model of\nMPPN self-assembly in which the preferred symmetry and size of MPPNs emerge\nfrom the interplay of protein-induced lipid bilayer deformations, topological\ndefects in protein packing, and thermal effects. With all model parameters\ndetermined directly from experiments, our model correctly predicts the observed\nsymmetry and size of MPPNs. Our model suggests how key lipid and protein\nproperties can be modified to produce a range of MPPN symmetries and sizes in\nexperiments.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00842v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Bilayer-thickness-mediated interactions between integral membrane\n  proteins', ['Osman Kahraman', 'Peter D. Koch', 'William S. Klug', 'Christoph A. Haselwandter'], u'2016-11-02', u'Hydrophobic thickness mismatch between integral membrane proteins and the\nsurrounding lipid bilayer can produce lipid bilayer thickness deformations.\nExperiment and theory have shown that protein-induced lipid bilayer thickness\ndeformations can yield energetically favorable bilayer-mediated interactions\nbetween integral membrane proteins, and large-scale organization of integral\nmembrane proteins into protein clusters in cell membranes. Within the continuum\nelasticity theory of membranes, the energy cost of protein-induced bilayer\nthickness deformations can be captured by considering compression and expansion\nof the bilayer hydrophobic core, membrane tension, and bilayer bending,\nresulting in biharmonic equilibrium equations describing the shape of lipid\nbilayers for a given set of bilayer-protein boundary conditions. Here we\ndevelop a combined analytic and numerical methodology for the solution of the\nequilibrium elastic equations associated with protein-induced lipid bilayer\ndeformations. Our methodology allows accurate prediction of thickness-mediated\nprotein interactions for arbitrary protein symmetries at arbitrary protein\nseparations and relative orientations. We provide exact analytic solutions for\ncylindrical integral membrane proteins with constant and varying hydrophobic\nthickness, and develop perturbative analytic solutions for non-cylindrical\nprotein shapes. We complement these analytic solutions, and assess their\naccuracy, by developing both finite element and finite difference numerical\nsolution schemes. Taken together, the work presented here puts into place an\nanalytic and numerical framework which allows calculation of bilayer-mediated\nelastic interactions between integral membrane proteins for the complicated\nprotein shapes suggested by structural biology and at the small protein\nseparations most relevant for the crowded membrane environments provided by\nliving cells.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00836v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Architecture and Function of Mechanosensitive Membrane Protein Lattices', ['Osman Kahraman', 'Peter D. Koch', 'William S. Klug', 'Christoph A. Haselwandter'], u'2016-11-02', u'Experiments have revealed that membrane proteins can form two-dimensional\nclusters with regular translational and orientational protein arrangements,\nwhich may allow cells to modulate protein function. However, the physical\nmechanisms yielding supramolecular organization and collective function of\nmembrane proteins remain largely unknown. Here we show that bilayer-mediated\nelastic interactions between membrane proteins can yield regular and\ndistinctive lattice architectures of protein clusters, and may provide a link\nbetween lattice architecture and lattice function. Using the mechanosensitive\nchannel of large conductance (MscL) as a model system, we obtain relations\nbetween the shape of MscL and the supramolecular architecture of MscL lattices.\nWe predict that the tetrameric and pentameric MscL symmetries observed in\nprevious structural studies yield distinct lattice architectures of MscL\nclusters and that, in turn, these distinct MscL lattice architectures yield\ndistinct lattice activation barriers. Our results suggest general physical\nmechanisms linking protein symmetry, the lattice architecture of membrane\nprotein clusters, and the collective function of membrane protein lattices.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00833v1', ['Biomolecules', 'Subcellular Processes'], []]
[u'Long-range suppressive influences from the visual surround can be\n  explained by anatomically plausible recruitment of local competition in a\n  model of columnar cortex', ['Hongzhi You', 'Giacomo Indiveri', 'Dylan Richard Muir'], u'2016-11-03', u'Although neurons in columns of tissue in visual cortex of adult carnivores\nand primates share similar preferences for the orientation of a visual\nstimulus, they can nevertheless have sparse and temporally uncorrelated firing\nvisual response properties. This effect is supported by the observation that\nlong-range excitatory connections between cortical neurons are functionally\nspecific, because they interconnect columns with similar orientation\npreference, and local short-range ones are unspecific and sparse. Coupled with\nstrong local inhibition, this network architecture is a good recipe for local\ncompetition arranged within a cortical column. In this paper we propose a model\narchitecture that is consistent with these experimental and anatomical\nfindings, and which explains the emergence of orientation-tuned surround\nsuppression. We explore the effect of local columnar competition, coupled with\nlocal and long-range functional specificity, as substrates for integration of\nresponses from the visual surround in columnar visual cortex. In addition, we\nshow how presentation of simulated full-field complex visual stimuli, designed\nto approximate visual scenes, leads to reduced correlation of local excitatory\nresponses and increased excitatory response selectivity (lifetime sparseness).\nThese effects occurred simultaneously with increased inhibitory activity and\ndecreased inhibitory sparseness, consistent with recordings of excitatory and\ninhibitory neurons in cortex. In our networks competition, reduced correlation\nand increased sparseness depended on both local and long-range specific\nexcitatory connectivity. The mechanism of local competition implemented in our\nmodel explains several aspects of integration of information from the visual\nsurround, and is consistent with experimentally measured spatial profiles of\ncortical excitation and inhibition.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00945v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Recurrent Neural Networks for Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Intrinsic\n  Networks from fMRI Data', ['R Devon Hjelm', 'Sergey M. Plis', 'Vince Calhoun'], u'2016-11-03', u'Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of temporally-coherent blood\noxygenization level-dependent (BOLD) signal provides an effective means of\nanalyzing functionally coherent patterns in the brain. Intrinsic networks and\nfunctional connectivity are important outcomes of fMRI studies and are central\nto understanding brain function and making diagnoses. The most popular method\nfor separating INs, independent component analysis, begins with the assumption\nthat the data is a mixture of maximally independent sources. ICA is trainable\nthrough one of many relatively simple optimization routines that maximize\nnon-Gaussianity or minimize mutual information. Although fMRI data is a time\nseries, ICA, as with other popular linear methods for separating INs, is\norder-agnostic in time: each multivariate signal at each time step is treated\nas i.i.d.. ICA in its common use in the field employs the same parameterization\nacross subjects, which allows for either temporal or spatial variability, but\nnot both. In order to overcome shortcomings of temporal ICA in lack of dynamics\nand subject-wise/temporal variability of spatial maps, but without abandoning\nthe fundamental strengths of ICA, we combine recurrent neural networks (RNNs)\nwith an ICA objective. The resulting model naturally represents temporal and\nspatial dynamics---having subject-wise and temporally variable spatial\nmaps---and is easily trainable using gradient descent and back-propagation.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00864v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

Recently, a set of approaches has been\ndeveloped that takes advantage of next generation DNA sequencing to scan\nconnections between neurons into a set of DNA barcodes. Individual DNA\nsequences called markers represent single neurons, while pairs of markers,\ncalled barcodes contain information about connections. Here we propose a\nstrategy for 'copying' or 'cloning' connectivity contained in barcodes into a\nclean slate tabula rasa network. We show that a one marker one cell (OMOC)\nrule, which forces all markers with the same sequence to condense into the same\nneuron, leads to fast and reliable formation of desired connectivity in a new\nnetwork. We show that OMOC rule yields convergence in a number of steps given\nby a power law function of the network size. We thus propose that copying\nnetwork connectivity from one network to another is theoretically possible.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00834v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Efficient causal inference with hidden confounders from\n  genome-transcriptome variation data', ['Lingfei Wang', 'Tom Michoel'], u'2016-11-03', u'Natural genetic variation between individuals in a population leads to\nvariations in gene expression that are informative for the inference of gene\nregulatory networks. Particularly, genome-wide genotype and transcriptome data\nfrom the same samples allow for causal inference between gene expression traits\nusing the DNA variations in cis-regulatory regions as causal anchors. However,\nexisting causal inference programs are not efficient enough for contemporary\ndatasets, and unrealistically assume the absence of hidden confounders\naffecting the coexpression of causally related gene pairs. Here we propose\nalternative statistical tests to infer causal effects in the presence of\nconfounding and weak regulations, and implemented both the novel and the\ntraditional causal inference tests in the software package Findr (Fast\nInference of Networks from Directed Regulations), achieving thousands to\nmillions of times of speedup due to analytical false positive rate estimation\nand implementational optimizations. A systematic evaluation using simulated\ndata from the DREAM5 Systems Genetics challenge demonstrated that the novel\ntests outperformed existing causal inference methods as well as all challenge\nsubmissions. We confirmed these results using siRNA silencing, ChIP-sequencing\nand microRNA target data to validate causal gene-gene and microRNA-gene\ninteractions inferred from genotype, microRNA and mRNA sequencing data of\nnearly 400 human individuals from the Geuvadis study. Findr provides the\ncommunity with the first efficient and accurate causal inference tool for\nmodern datasets of tens of thousands of RNA expression traits and genotypes\nfrom hundreds or more human individuals.

[u'Multitask Protein Function Prediction Through Task Dissimilarity', ['Marco Frasca', 'Nicolo Cesa Bianchi'], u'2016-11-03', u'Automated protein function prediction is a challenging problem with\ndistinctive features, such as the hierarchical organization of protein\nfunctions and the scarcity of annotated proteins for most biological functions.\nWe propose a multitask learning algorithm addressing both issues. Unlike\nstandard multitask algorithms, which use task (protein functions) similarity\ninformation as a bias to speed up learning, we show that dissimilarity\ninformation enforces separation of rare class labels from frequent class\nlabels, and for this reason is better suited for solving unbalanced protein\nfunction prediction problems. We support our claim by showing that a multitask\nextension of the label propagation algorithm empirically works best when the\ntask relatedness information is represented using a dissimilarity matrix as\nopposed to a similarity matrix. Moreover, the experimental comparison carried\nout on three model organism shows that our method has a more stable performance\nin both "protein-centric" and "function-centric" evaluation settings.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00962v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Analysis of Metagenome Composition by the Method of Random Primers', ['Valery Kirzhner', 'Zeev Volkovich', 'Renata Avros', 'Katerina Korenblat'], u'2016-11-02', u'Metagenome, a mixture of different genomes (as a rule, bacterial), represents\na pattern, and the analysis of its composition is, currently, one of the\nchallenging problems of bioinformatics. In the present study, the possibility\nof evaluating metagenome composition by DNA-marker methods is investigated.\nThese methods are based on using primers, short nucleic acid fragments. Each\nprimer picks out of the tested genome the fragment set specific just for this\ngenome, which is called its spectrum (for the given primer) and is used for\nidentifying the genome. The DNA-marker method, applied to a metagenome, also\ngives its spectrum, which, obviously, represents the union of the spectra of\nall genomes belonging to the metagenome. Thus each primer provides a projection\nof the genomes and of the metagenome onto the corresponding spectra set. Here\nwe propose to apply the random projection (random primer) approach for\nanalyzing metagenome composition and present some estimates of the method\neffectiveness for the case of Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD)\ntechnology.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01037v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
