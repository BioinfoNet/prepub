[u'Proteins analysed as virtual knots', ['Keith Alexander', 'Alexander J Taylor', 'Mark R Dennis'], u'2016-11-18', u'Long, flexible physical filaments are naturally tangled and knotted, from\nmacroscopic string down to long-chain molecules. The existence of knotting in a\nfilament naturally affects its configuration and properties, and may be very\nstable or disappear rapidly under manipulation and interaction. Knotting has\nbeen previously identified in protein backbone chains, for which these\nmechanical constraints are of fundamental importance to their molecular\nfunctionality, despite their being open curves in which the knots are not\nmathematically well defined; knotting can only be identified by closing the\ntermini of the chain somehow. We introduce a new method for resolving knotting\nin open curves using virtual knots, a wider class of topological objects that\ndo not require a classical closure and so naturally capture the topological\nambiguity inherent in open curves. We describe the results of analysing\nproteins in the Protein Data Bank by this new scheme, recovering and extending\nprevious knotting results, and identifying topological interest in some new\ncases. The statistics of virtual knots in protein chains are compared with\nthose of open random walks and Hamiltonian subchains on cubic lattices,\nidentifying a regime of open curves in which the virtual knotting description\nis likely to be important.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06185v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Combining simulations and solution experiments as a paradigm for RNA\n  force field refinement', ['Andrea Cesari', 'Alejandro Gil-Ley', 'Giovanni Bussi'], u'2016-11-18', u'Recent computational efforts have shown that the current potential energy\nmodels used in molecular dynamics are not accurate enough to describe the\nconformational ensemble of RNA oligomers and suggest that molecular dynamics\nshould be complemented with experimental data. We here propose a scheme based\non the maximum entropy principle to combine simulations with bulk experiments.\nIn the proposed scheme the noise arising from both the measurements and the\nforward models used to back calculate the experimental observables is\nexplicitly taken into account. The method is tested on RNA nucleosides and is\nthen used to construct chemically consistent corrections to the Amber RNA force\nfield that allow a large set of experimental data on nucleosides and\ndinucleosides to be correctly reproduced. The transferability of these\ncorrections is assessed against independent data on tetranucleotides and\ndisplays a previously unreported agreement with experiments. This procedure can\nbe applied to enforce multiple experimental data on multiple systems in a\nself-consistent framework thus suggesting a new paradigm for force field\nrefinement.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06156v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Variants of intrinsic disorder in the human proteome', ['Antonio Deiana', 'Andrea Giansanti'], u'2016-11-18', u'In this paper we propose a straightforward operational definition of variants\nof disordered proteins, taking the human proteome as a case study. The focus is\non a distinction between mostly unstructured proteins and proteins which\ncontain long unstructured regions accommodated in an overall folded structure.\nIn particular we distinguish: i) Not disordered proteins (NDPs), that either\nhave all their residues ordered or do not have disordered segments longer than\n30 residues nor more than 30% of disordered residues; ii) Proteins with\nintrinsically disordered regions (IDRPs), that have at least one disordered\ndomain longer than 30 residues, but disordered in less than 30% of their\nresidues; iii) Proteins that are intrinsically disordered (IDPs), that have\nboth at least one disordered segment longer than 30 residues and that are\ndisordered on more than 30% of their residues; iv) Proteins with fragmented\ndisorder (FRAG_IDPs), that do not have a disordered fragment longer than 30\nresidues but that, nevertheless, have at least 30% or more of their residues\npredicted as disordered. The potential use of these variants is checked over\nseveral groups of disease-related proteins. Our main conclusions point out that\nIDRPs are more similar to NDPs than to IDPs. IDRPs and NDPs have a similar\nfunctional repertoire and probably share a lock-and-key mechanism of\ninteraction with substrates. IDRPs and IDPs are differently present among human\ndisease-related proteins. IDRPs probably do not play a specific role in the\ndevelopment of complex diseases, since their frequency is similar in\ndisease-related proteins and in the entire human proteome. IDPs can play a role\nin the emergence of cancer, neurodegenerative, thyroid and liver disease.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06072v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]

[u'Deriving reproducible biomarkers from multi-site resting-state data: An\n  Autism-based example', ['Alexandre Abraham', 'Michael Milham', 'Adriana Di Martino', 'R.

However,\nextracting such biomarkers is challenging for complex multi-faceted\nneuropatholo-gies, such as autism spectrum disorders. Large multi-site datasets\nincrease sample sizes to compensate for this complexity, at the cost of\nuncontrolled heterogeneity. This heterogeneity raises new challenges, akin to\nthose face in realistic diagnostic applications. Here, we demonstrate the\nfeasibility of inter-site classification of neuropsychiatric status, with an\napplication to the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) database, a large\n(N=871) multi-site autism dataset. For this purpose, we investigate pipelines\nthat extract the most predictive biomarkers from the data. These R-fMRI\npipelines build participant-specific connectomes from functionally-defined\nbrain areas. Connectomes are then compared across participants to learn\npatterns of connectivity that differentiate typical controls from individuals\nwith autism. We predict this neuropsychiatric status for participants from the\nsame acquisition sites or different, unseen, ones. Good choices of methods for\nthe various steps of the pipeline lead to 67% prediction accuracy on the full\nABIDE data, which is significantly better than previously reported results. We\nperform extensive validation on multiple subsets of the data defined by\ndifferent inclusion criteria. These enables detailed analysis of the factors\ncontributing to successful connectome-based prediction. First, prediction\naccuracy improves as we include more subjects, up to the maximum amount of\nsubjects available. Second, the definition of functional brain areas is of\nparamount importance for biomarker discovery: brain areas extracted from large\nR-fMRI datasets outperform reference atlases in the classification tasks.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06066v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], [u'NEUROSPIN, PARIETAL', u'NKI', u'SUNY', u'PARIETAL, NEUROSPIN']]
[u'Morphology of Fly Larval Class IV Dendrites Accords with a Random\n  Branching and Contact Based Branch Deletion Model', ['Sujoy Ganguly', 'Olivier Trottier', 'Xin Liang', 'Hugo Bowne-Anderson', 'Jonathon Howard'], u'2016-11-17', u'Dendrites are branched neuronal processes that receive input signals from\nother neurons or the outside world [1]. To maintain connectivity as the\norganism grows, dendrites must also continue to grow. For example, the\ndendrites in the peripheral nervous system continue to grow and branch to\nmaintain proper coverage of their receptor fields [2, 3, 4, 5]. One such neuron\nis the Drosophila melanogaster class IV dendritic arborization neuron [6]. The\ndendritic arbors of these neurons tile the larval surface [7], where they\ndetect localized noxious stimuli, such as jabs from parasitic wasps [8]. In the\npresent study, we used a novel measure, the hitting probability, to show that\nthe class IV neuron forms a tight mesh that covers the larval surface.\nFurthermore, we found that the mesh size remains largely unchanged during the\nlarval stages, despite a dramatic increase in overall size of the neuron and\nthe larva. We also found that the class IV dendrites are dense (assayed with\nthe fractal dimension) and uniform (assayed with the lacunarity) throughout the\nlarval stages. To understand how the class IV neuron maintains its morphology\nduring larval development, we constructed a mathematical model based on random\nbranching and self-avoidance. We found that if the branching rate is uniform in\nspace and time and that if all contacting branches are deleted, we can\nreproduce the branch length distribution, mesh size and density of the class IV\ndendrites throughout the larval stages. Thus, a simple set of statistical rules\ncan generate and maintain a complex branching morphology during growth.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05918v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

Here, we evaluate the extent to which it can be inferred\nas the correct model given experimental data.

[u'Quantifying gender preferences across humans lifespan', ['Asim Ghosh', 'Daniel Monsivais', 'Kunal Bhattacharya', 'Robin I. M. Dunbar', 'Kimmo Kaski'], u'2016-11-18', u"In human relations individuals' gender and age play a key role in the\nstructures and dynamics of their social arrangements. In order to analyze the\ngender preferences of individuals in interaction with others at different\nstages of their lives we study a large mobile phone dataset. To do this we\nconsider four fundamental gender-related caller and callee combinations of\nhuman interactions, namely male to male, male to female, female to male, and\nfemale to female, which together with age, kinship, and different levels of\nfriendship give rise to a wide scope of human sociality. Here we analyse the\nrelative strength of these four types of interaction using a large dataset of\nmobile phone communication records. Our analysis suggests strong age dependence\nfor an ego of one gender choosing to call an individual of either gender. We\nobserve a strong opposite sex bonding across most of their reproductive age.\nHowever, older women show a strong tendency to connect to another female that\nis one generation younger in a way that is suggestive of the\n\\emph{grandmothering effect}. We also find that the relative strength among the\nfour possible interactions depends on phone call duration. For calls of medium\nand long duration, opposite gender interactions are significantly more probable\nthan same gender interactions during the reproductive years, suggesting\npotential emotional exchange between spouses. By measuring the fraction of\ncalls to other generations we find that mothers tend to make calls more to\ntheir daughters than to their sons, whereas fathers make calls more to their\nsons than to their daughters. For younger people, most of their calls go to\nsame generation alters, while older people call the younger people more\nfrequently, which supports the suggestion that \\emph{affection flows downward}.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06049v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

We\nhave carried out a global strategy, which combined two complementary\napproaches. The first one is genome guided with deep analysis of genome\nsequences and the second one is assay guided with experiments to support the\npredictions obtained in silico. This efficient screening for new secondary\nmetabolites, performed on 48 gapless genomes of Burkholderia species, revealed\na total of 161 clusters containing nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs),\nwith the potential to synthesize at least 11 novel products. Most of them are\nsiderophores or lipopeptides, two classes of products with potential\napplication in biocontrol. The strategy led to the identification, for the\nfirst time, of the cluster for cepaciachelin biosynthesis in the genome of\nBurkholderia ambifaria AMMD and a cluster corresponding to a new\nmalleobactin-like siderophore, called phymabactin, was identified in\nBurkholderia phymatum STM815 genome. In both cases, the siderophore was\nproduced when the strain was grown in iron-limited conditions. Elsewhere, the\ncluster for the antifungal burkholdin was detected in the genome of B.\nambifaria AMMD and also Burkholderia sp. KJ006. Burkholderia pseudomallei\nstrains harbor the genetic potential to produce a novel lipopeptide called\nburkhomycin, containing a peptidyl moiety of 12 monomers. A mixture of\nlipopeptides produced by Burkholderia rhizoxinica lowered the surface tension\nof the supernatant from 70 to 27 mN/m. The production of nonribosomal secondary\nmetabolites seems related to the three phylogenetic groups obtained from 16S\nrRNA sequences. Moreover, the genome-mining approach gave new insights into the\nnonribosomal synthesis exemplified by the identification of dual C/E domains in\nlipopeptide NRPSs, up to now essentially found in Pseudomonas strains.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06065v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], [u'CRIStAL, BONSAI']]

[u'Focal adhesion kinase - the reversible molecular mechanosensor', ['Samuel Bell', 'Eugene M. Terentjev'], u'2016-11-18', u'Sensors are the first element of the pathways that control the response of\ncells to their environment. After chemical, the next most important cue is\nmechanical, and protein complexes that produce or enable a chemical signal in\nresponse to a mechanical stimulus are called mechanosensors. There is a sharp\ndistinction between sensing an external force or pressure/tension applied to\nthe cell, and sensing the mechanical stiffness of the environment. We call the\nfirst mechanosensitivity of the 1st kind, and the latter mechanosensitivity of\nthe 2nd kind. There are two variants of protein complexes that act as\nmechanosensors of the 2nd kind: producing the one-off or a reversible action.\nThe latent complex of TGF-beta is an example of the one-off action: on the\nrelease of active TGF-beta signal, the complex is discarded and needs to be\nreplaced. In contrast, the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in a complex with\nintegrin is a reversible mechanosensor, which initiates the chemical signal in\nits active phosphorylated conformation, but can spontaneously return to its\nclosed folded conformation. Here we study the physical mechanism of the\nreversible mechanosensor of the 2nd kind, using FAK as a practical example, and\nfind how the rates of conformation changes depend on the substrate stiffness\nand the pulling force applied from the cell cytoskeleton. The results compare\nwell with the phenotype observations of cells on different substrates.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06053v1', ['Subcellular Processes'], []]
