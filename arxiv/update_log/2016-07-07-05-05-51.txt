[u'Recent advances in coarse-grained modeling of virus assembly', ['Michael F. Hagan', 'Roya Zandi'], u'2016-07-06', u'In many virus families, tens to thousands of proteins assemble spontaneously\ninto a capsid (protein shell) while packaging the genomic nucleic acid. This\nreview summarizes recent advances in computational modeling of these dynamical\nprocesses. We present an overview of recent technological and algorithmic\ndevelopments, which are enabling simulations to describe the large ranges of\nlength-and time-scales relevant to assembly, under conditions more closely\nmatched to experiments than in earlier work. We then describe two examples in\nwhich computational modeling has recently provided an important complement to\nexperiments.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01452v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Linking in domain-swapped protein dimers', ['Marco Baiesi', 'Enzo Orlandini', 'Antonio Trovato', 'Flavio Seno'], u'2016-07-05', u"The presence of physical knots has been observed in a small fraction of\nsingle-domain proteins and related to their thermodynamic and kinetic\nproperties. The entanglement between different chains in multimeric protein\ncomplexes, as captured by their linking number, may as well represent a\nsignificant topological feature. The exchanging of identical structural\nelements typical of domain-swapped proteins make them suitable candidates to\nvalidate this possibility. Here we analyze $110$ non redundant domain-swapped\ndimers filtered from the 3Dswap and Proswap databases, by keeping only\nstructures not affected by the presence of holes along the main backbone chain.\nThe linking number $G'$ determined by Gauss integrals on the $C_\\alpha$\nbackbones is shown to be a solid and efficient tool for quantifying the mutual\nentanglement, also due to its strong correlation with the topological linking\naveraged over many closures of the chains. Our analysis evidences a quite high\nfraction of chains with a significant linking, that is with $|G'|>1$. We report\nthat Nature promotes configurations with $G'<0$ and surprisingly, it seems to\nsuppress linking of long proteins. While proteins composed of about $100$\nresidues can be well linked in the swapped dimer form, this is not observed for\nmuch longer chains. Upon dissociation of a few dimers via numerical\nsimulations, we observe an exponential decay of the linking number with time,\nproviding an additional useful characterization of the entanglement within\nswapped dimers. Our results provide a novel and robust topology-based\nclassification of protein-swapped dimers together with some preliminary\nevidence of its impact on their physical and biological properties.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01414v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]

In vitro, protein corona and stability assays show\nthat phosphonic acid PEG copolymers outperform all other coating types\nexamined, including low molecular weight anionic ligands and polymers.

Iron oxide particles coated\nwith multi-phosphonic acid PEG polymers are shown to have a blood circulation\nlifetime of 250 minutes, i.e. 10 to 50 times greater than that of recently\npublished PEGylated probes and benchmarks. The clearance from the liver takes\nin average 2 to 3 days and is independent of the core size, coating and\nparticle stability.

[u'Using Perturbations to Probe the Neural Control of Rhythmic Movements', ['Tim Kiemel', 'David Logan', 'John J. Jeka'], u'2016-07-06', u'Small continuous sensory and mechanical perturbations have often been used to\nidentify properties of the closed-loop neural control of posture and other\nsystems that are approximately linear time invariant. Here we extend this\napproach to study the neural control of rhythmic behaviors such as walking. Our\nmethod is based on the theory of linear time periodic systems, with\nmodifications to account for ability of perturbations to reset the phase of a\nrhythmic behavior. We characterize responses to perturbations in the frequency\ndomain using harmonic transfer functions and then convert to the time domain to\nobtain phase-dependent impulse response functions (IRFs) that describe the\nresponse to a small brief perturbation at any phase of the rhythmic behavior.\nIRFs describing responses of kinematic variables and muscle activations\n(measured by EMG) to sensory and mechanical perturbations can be used to infer\nproperties of the plant, the mapping from muscle activation to movement, and of\nneural feedback, the mapping from movement to muscle activation. We illustrate\nour method by applying it to simulated data from a model and experimental data\nof subjects walking on a treadmill perturbed by movement of the visual scene.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01746v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Optimal Trajectories of Brain State Transitions', ['Shi Gu', 'Richard F. Betzel', 'Matthew Cieslak', 'Philip R. Delio', 'Scott T. Grafton', 'Fabio Pasqualetti', 'Danielle S. Bassett'], u'2016-07-06', u'The complexity of neural dynamics stems in part from the complexity of the\nunderlying anatomy. Yet how the organization of white matter architecture\nconstrains how the brain transitions from one cognitive state to another\nremains unknown. Here we address this question from a computational perspective\nby defining a brain state as a pattern of activity across brain regions.\nDrawing on recent advances in network control theory, we model the underlying\nmechanisms of brain state transitions as elicited by the collective control of\nregion sets. Specifically, we examine how the brain moves from a specified\ninitial state (characterized by high activity in the default mode) to a\nspecified target state (characterized by high activity in primary sensorimotor\ncortex) in finite time. Across all state transitions, we observe that the\nsupramarginal gyrus and the inferior parietal lobule consistently acted as\nefficient, low energy control hubs, consistent with their strong anatomical\nconnections to key input areas of sensorimotor cortex. Importantly, both these\nand other regions in the fronto-parietal, cingulo-opercular, and attention\nsystems are poised to affect a broad array of state transitions that cannot\neasily be classified by traditional notions of control common in the\nengineering literature. This theoretical versatility comes with a vulnerability\nto injury. In patients with mild traumatic brain injury, we observe a loss of\nspecificity in putative control processes, suggesting greater susceptibility to\ndamage-induced noise in neurophysiological activity. These results offer\nfundamentally new insights into the mechanisms driving brain state transitions\nin healthy cognition and their alteration following injury.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01706v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

[u'Chaotic provinces in the kingdom of the Red Queen', ['Hanna Schenk', 'Arne Traulsen', 'Chaitanya S. Gokhale'], u'2016-07-06', u'The interplay between parasites and their hosts is found in all kinds of\nspecies and plays an important role in understanding the principles of\nevolution and coevolution. Usually, the different genotypes of hosts and\nparasites oscillate in their abundances. The well-established theory of\noscillatory Red Queen dynamics proposes an ongoing change in frequencies of the\ndifferent types within each species. So far, it is unclear in which way Red\nQueen dynamics persists with more than two types of hosts and parasites. In our\nanalysis, an arbitrary number of types within two species are examined in a\ndeterministic framework with constant or changing population size. This general\nframework allows for analytical solutions for internal fixed points and their\nstability. For more than two species, apparently chaotic dynamics has been\nreported. Here we show that even for two species, once more than two types are\nconsidered per species, irregular dynamics in their frequencies can be observed\nin the long run. The nature of the dynamics depends strongly on the initial\nconfiguration of the system; the usual regular Red Queen oscillations are only\nobserved in some parts of the parameter region.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01564v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

Based on a dissimilarity\nbuilt using correlation structures, we consider networks that connect all the\ngenes based on the strength of their dissimilarity. The large number of genes\nrequire the use of the threshold to find sparse structures in the graph. in\nthis work, using the notion of graph coreness, we identify clusters of genes\nwhich are central in the network. Then we estimate a network that has these\ngenes as main hubs. We use this new representation to identify biologically\nmeaningful clusters, and to highlight the importance of the nodes that compose\nthe core structures based on biological interpretations.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01516v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], [u'IMT', u'I2MC']]
[u'Scaling Laws in Spatial Network Formation', ['Nora Molkenthin', 'Marc Timme'], u'2016-07-05', u'Geometric constraints impact the formation of a broad range of spatial\nnetworks, from amino acid chains folding to proteins structures to rearranging\nparticle aggregates. How the network of interactions dynamically self-organizes\nin such systems is far from fully understood. Here, we analyze a class of\nspatial network formation processes by introducing a mapping from geometric to\ngraph-theoretic constraints. Combining stochastic and mean field analyses\nyields an algebraic scaling law for the extent (graph diameter) of the\nresulting networks with system size, in contrast to logarithmic scaling known\nfor networks without constraints. Intriguingly, the exponent falls between that\nof self-avoiding random walks and that of space filling arrangements,\nconsistent with experimentally observed scaling (of the spatial radius of\ngyration) for protein tertiary structures.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01435v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
[u'Stochastic multi-scale models of competition within heterogeneous\n  cellular populations: simulation methods and mean-field analysis', ['Roberto de la Cruz', 'Pilar Guerrero', 'Fabian Spill', 'Tomas Alarcon'], u'2016-07-06', u'We propose a modelling framework to analyse the stochastic behaviour of\nheterogeneous, multi-scale cellular populations. We illustrate our methodology\nwith a particular example in which we study a population with an\noxygen-regulated proliferation rate. Our formulation is based on an\nage-dependent stochastic process. Cells within the population are characterised\nby their age. The age-dependent (oxygen-regulated) birth rate is given by a\nstochastic model of oxygen-dependent cell cycle progression. We then formulate\nan age-dependent birth-and-death process, which dictates the time evolution of\nthe cell population. The population is under a feedback loop which controls its\nsteady state size: cells consume oxygen which in turns fuels cell\nproliferation. We show that our stochastic model of cell cycle progression\nallows for heterogeneity within the cell population induced by stochastic\neffects. Such heterogeneous behaviour is reflected in variations in the\nproliferation rate. Within this set-up, we have established three main results.\nFirst, we have shown that the age to the G1/S transition, which essentially\ndetermines the birth rate, exhibits a remarkably simple scaling behaviour. This\nallows for a huge simplification of our numerical methodology. A further result\nis the observation that heterogeneous populations undergo an internal process\nof quasi-neutral competition. Finally, we investigated the effects of\ncell-cycle-phase dependent therapies (such as radiation therapy) on\nheterogeneous populations. In particular, we have studied the case in which the\npopulation contains a quiescent sub-population. Our mean-field analysis and\nnumerical simulations confirm that, if the survival fraction of the therapy is\ntoo high, rescue of the quiescent population occurs. This gives rise to\nemergence of resistance to therapy since the rescued population is less\nsensitive to therapy.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01449v1', ['Cell Behavior'], []]
