[u'Proton tunneling in hydrogen bonds and its possible implications in an induced-fit model of enzyme catalysis', ['Onur Pusuluk', 'Tristan Farrow', 'Cemsinan Deliduman', 'Keith Burnett', 'Vlatko Vedral'], u'2017-03-02', u'The role of proton tunneling in biological catalysis remains an open question usually addressed with the tools of biochemistry. Here, we map the proton motion in a hydrogen-bonded system into a problem of pseudo-spins to allow us to approach the problem using quantum information theory and thermodynamics. We investigate the dynamics of the quantum correlations generated through two hydrogen bonds between a prototypical enzyme and a substrate, and discuss the possibility of utilizing these correlations as a resource in the catalytic power of the enzyme. In particular, we show that classical changes induced in the binding site of the enzyme spreads the quantum correlations among all of the four hydrogen-bonded atoms. If the enzyme suddenly returns to its initial state after the binding stage, the substrate ends in a quantum superposition state. Environmental effects can then naturally drive the reaction in the forward direction from the substrate to the product without needing the additional catalytic stage that is usually assumed to follow the binding stage. We find that in this scenario the enzyme lowers the activation energy to a much lower value than expected in biochemical reactions.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00789v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'A mean-field model for conductance-based networks of adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire neurons', ['Yann Zerlaut', 'Alain Destexhe'], u'2017-03-02', u'Voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDi) has revealed fundamental properties of neocortical processing at mesoscopic scales. Since VSDi signals report the average membrane potential, it seems natural to use a mean-field formalism to model such signals. Here, we investigate a mean-field model of networks of Adaptive Exponential (AdEx) integrate-and-fire neurons, with conductance-based synaptic interactions. The AdEx model can capture the spiking response of different cell types, such as regular-spiking (RS) excitatory neurons and fast-spiking (FS) inhibitory neurons. We use a Master Equation formalism, together with a semi-analytic approach to the transfer function of AdEx neurons. We compare the predictions of this mean-field model to simulated networks of RS-FS cells, first at the level of the spontaneous activity of the network, which is well predicted by the mean-field model. Second, we investigate the response of the network to time-varying external input, and show that the mean-field model accurately predicts the response time course of the population. One notable exception was that the "tail" of the response at long times was not well predicted, because the mean-field does not include adaptation mechanisms. We conclude that the Master Equation formalism can yield mean-field models that predict well the behavior of nonlinear networks with conductance-based interactions and various electrophysiolgical properties, and should be a good candidate to model VSDi signals where both excitatory and inhibitory neurons contribute.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00698v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Morphology, cell division, and viability of Saccharomyces cerevisiae at high hydrostatic pressure', ['Khanh Nguyen', 'Steven Murray', 'Jeffery A. Lewis', 'Pradeep Kumar'], u'2017-03-01', u'High hydrostatic pressure is commonly encountered in many environments, but the effects of high pressure on eukaryotic cells have been understudied. To understand the effects of hydrostatic pressure in the model eukaryote, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we have performed quantitative experiments of cell division, cell morphology, and cell death under a wide range of pressures. We developed an automated image analysis method for quantification of the yeast budding index - a measure of cell cycle state - as well as a continuum model of budding to investigate the effect of pressure on cell division and cell morphology. We find that the budding index, the average cell size, and the eccentricity - a measure of how much the cell morphology varies from the being elliptical - of the cells decrease with increasing pressure. Furthermore, high hydrostatic pressure led to the small but finite probability of cell death via both apoptosis and necrosis. Our experiments suggest that decrease of budding index arises from cellular arrest or death at the cell cycle checkpoints during different stages of cell division.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00547v1', ['Populations and Evolution', 'Quantitative Methods', 'Cell Behavior'], []]
[u'Metrics and Harmonic Analysis on DNA', ['A.

[u'Absolute bacterial cell enumeration using flow cytometry', ['Fang Ou', 'Cushla McGoverin', 'Simon Swift', 'Frederique Vanholsbeeck'], u'2017-03-02', u'Aim: To develop a generalised flow cytometry protocol that uses reference beads for the enumeration of live and dead bacteria present in a mixture. Methods and Results: Mixtures of live and dead Escherichia coli with live:dead concentration ratios varying from 0 to 100% were prepared. These samples were stained using SYTO 9 and propidium iodide and 6 {\\mu}m beads reference beads were added. Bacteria present in live samples were enumerated by agar plate counting. Bacteria present in dead samples were enumerated by agar plate counting before treatment with isopropanol. There is a linear relationship between the presented flow cytometry method and agar plate counts for live (R2 = 0.99) and dead E. coli (R2 = 0.93) concentrations of ca. 104 to 108 bacteria mL-1 within mixtures of live and dead bacteria. Conclusions: Reliable enumeration of live E. coli within a mixture of both live and dead was possible down to concentration ratio of 2.5% live and for the enumeration of dead E. coli the lower limit was ca. 20% dead. Significance and Impact of the Study: The ability to obtain absolute cell concentrations is only available for selected flow cytometers, this study describes a method for accurate enumeration that is applicable to basic flow cytometers without specialised counting features. In particular we performed bacterial enumeration on mixtures of live and dead bacteria, with the live:dead concentration ratio ranging from 100% down to 0% and quantified the lower limit of detection. The ability to accurately count live and dead cells in a sample in near real-time has potential for quality control processes in medicine and in food and industrial processing.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00895v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'*K-means and Cluster Models for Cancer Signatures', ['Zura Kakushadze', 'Willie Yu'], u'2017-03-02', u"We present *K-means clustering algorithm and source code by expanding statistical clustering methods applied in https://ssrn.com/abstract=2802753 to quantitative finance. *K-means is essentially deterministic without specifying initial centers, etc. We apply *K-means to extracting cancer signatures from genome data without using nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). *K-means' computational cots is a faction of NMF's. Using 1,389 published samples for 14 cancer types, we find that 3 cancers (liver cancer, lung cancer and renal cell carcinoma) stand out and do not have cluster-like structures. Two clusters have especially high within-cluster correlations with 11 other cancers indicating common underlying structures. Our approach opens a novel avenue for studying such structures. *K-means is universal and can be applied in other fields.

[u'A resource-frugal probabilistic dictionary and applications in bioinformatics', ['Camille Marchet', 'Lolita Lecompte', 'Antoine Limasset', 'Lucie Bittner', 'Pierre Peterlongo'], u'2017-03-02', u'Indexing massive data sets is extremely expensive for large scale problems. In many fields, huge amounts of data are currently generated, however extracting meaningful information from voluminous data sets, such as computing similarity between elements, is far from being trivial. It remains nonetheless a fundamental need. This work proposes a probabilistic data structure based on a minimal perfect hash function for indexing large sets of keys. Our structure out-compete the hash table for construction, query times and for memory usage, in the case of the indexation of a static set. To illustrate the impact of algorithms performances, we provide two applications based on similarity computation between collections of sequences, and for which this calculation is an expensive but required operation. In particular, we show a practical case in which other bioinformatics tools fail to scale up the tested data set or provide lower quality results.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00667v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Mathematical modelling of calcium signalling taking into account mechanical effects', ['Katerina Kaouri', 'Philip K. Maini', 'S. Jonathan Chapman'], u'2017-03-01', u'Most of the calcium in the body is stored in bone. The rest is stored elsewhere, and calcium signalling is one of the most important mechanisms of information propagation in the body. Yet, many questions remain open. In this work, we initially consider the mathematical model proposed in Atri et al. \\cite{ atri1993single}. Omitting diffusion, the model is a system of two nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for the calcium concentration, and the fraction of $IP_3$ receptors that have not been inactivated by the calcium. We analyse in detail the system as the $IP_3$ concentration, the \\textit{bifurcation parameter}, increases presenting some new insights. We analyse asymptotically the relaxation oscillations of the model by exploiting a separation of timescales. Furthermore, motivated by experimental evidence that cells release calcium when mechanically stimulated and that, in turn, calcium release affects the mechanical behaviour of cells, we propose an extension of the Atri model to a 3D nonlinear ODE mechanochemical model, where the additional equation, derived consistently from a full viscoelastic \\emph{ansatz}, models the evolution of cell/tissue dilatation. Furthermore, in the calcium dynamics equation we introduce a new "stretch-activation" source term that induces calcium release and which involves a new bifurcation parameter, the "strength" of the source. Varying the two bifurcation parameters, we analyse in detail the interplay of the mechanical and the chemical effects, and we find that as the strength of the mechanical stimulus is increased, the $IP_3$ parameter range for which oscillations emerge decreases, until oscillations eventually vanish at a critical value. Finally, we analyse the model when the calcium dynamics are assumed faster than the dynamics of the other two variables.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00540v1', ['Quantitative Methods', 'Cell Behavior'], []]
[u'The free lunch of a scale-free metabolism', ['Daniele De Martino'], u'2017-03-02', u'In this work it is shown that scale free tails in metabolic flux distributions inferred from realistic large scale models can be simply an artefact due to reactions involved in thermodynamically unfeasible cycles, that are unbounded by physical constraints and would be able to perform work without expenditure of free energy. After correcting for thermodynamics, the metabolic space scales meaningfully with the physical limiting factors, acquiring in turn a richer multimodal structure potentially leading to symmetry breaking while optimizing for objective functions.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00853v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
[u"A yield-cost tradeoff governs Escherichia coli's decision between fermentation and respiration in carbon-limited growth", ['Matteo Mori', 'Enzo Marinari', 'Andrea De Martino'], u'2017-03-02', u"Many microbial systems are known to actively reshape their proteomes in response to changes in growth conditions induced e.g. by nutritional stress or antibiotics. Part of the re-allocation accounts for the fact that, as the growth rate is limited by targeting specific metabolic activities, cells simply respond by fine-tuning their proteome to invest more resources into the limiting activity (i.e. by synthesizing more proteins devoted to it). However, this is often accompanied by an overall re-organization of metabolism, aimed at improving the growth yield under limitation by re-wiring resource through different pathways. While both effects impact proteome composition, the latter underlies a more complex systemic response to stress. By focusing on E. coli's `acetate switch', we use mathematical modeling and a re-analysis of empirical data to show that the transition from a predominantly fermentative to a predominantly respirative metabolism in carbon-limited growth results from the trade-off between maximizing the growth yield and minimizing its costs in terms of required the proteome share. In particular, E. coli's metabolic phenotypes appear to be Pareto-optimal for these objective functions over a broad range of dilutions.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00748v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
