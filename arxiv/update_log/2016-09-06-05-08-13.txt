[u'A max-cut approach to heterogeneity in cryo-electron microscopy', ['Yariv Aizenbud', 'Yoel Shkolnisky'], u'2016-09-05', u'The field of cryo-electron microscopy has made astounding advancements in the\npast few years, mainly due to improvements in the hardware of the microscopes.\nYet, one of the key open challenges of the field remains the processing of\nheterogeneous data sets, produced from samples containing particles at several\ndifferent conformational states. For such data sets, one must first classify\ntheir images into homogeneous groups, where each group corresponds to the same\nunderlying structure, followed by reconstruction of a three-dimensional model\nfrom each of the homogeneous groups. This task has been proven to be extremely\ndifficult. In this paper we present an iterative algorithm for processing\nheterogeneous data sets that combines the classification and reconstruction\nsteps. We prove accuracy and stability bounds on the algorithm, and demonstrate\nit on simulated as well as experimental data sets.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01100v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'The Energy Landscape Underpinning Module Dynamics in the Human Brain\n  Connectome', ['Arian Ashourvan', 'Shi Gu', 'Marcelo G. Mattar', 'Jean M. Vettel', 'Danielle S. Bassett'], u'2016-09-05', u"Human brain dynamics can be profitably viewed through the lens of statistical\nmechanics, where neurophysiological activity evolves around and between local\nattractors representing preferred mental states. Many physically-inspired\nmodels of these dynamics define the state of the brain based on instantaneous\nmeasurements of regional activity. Yet, recent work in network neuroscience has\nprovided initial evidence that the brain might also be well-characterized by\ntime-varying states composed of locally coherent activity or functional\nmodules. Here we study this network-based notion of brain state to understand\nhow functional modules dynamically interact with one another to perform\ncognitive functions. We estimate the functional relationships between regions\nof interest (ROIs) by fitting a pair-wise maximum entropy model to each ROI's\npattern of allegiance to functional modules. Local minima in this model\nrepresent attractor states characterized by specific patterns of modular\nstructure. The clustering of local minima highlights three classes of ROIs with\nsimilar patterns of allegiance to community states. Visual, attention,\nsensorimotor, and subcortical ROIs tend to form a single functional community.\nThe remaining ROIs tend to form a putative executive control community or a\nputative default mode and salience community. We simulate the brain's dynamic\ntransitions between these community states using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo\nrandom walk. We observe that simulated transition probabilities between basins\nresemble empirically observed transitions between community allegiance states\nin resting state fMRI data. These results collectively offer a view of the\nbrain as a dynamical system that transitions between basins of attraction\ncharacterized by coherent activity in small groups of brain regions, and that\nthe strength of these attractors depends on the cognitive computations being\nperformed.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01015v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Decoding visual stimuli in human brain by using Anatomical Pattern\n  Analysis on fMRI images', ['Muhammad Yousefnezhad', 'Daoqiang Zhang'], u'2016-09-04', u'A universal unanswered question in neuroscience and machine learning is\nwhether computers can decode the patterns of the human brain. Multi-Voxels\nPattern Analysis (MVPA) is a critical tool for addressing this question.\nHowever, there are two challenges in the previous MVPA methods, which include\ndecreasing sparsity and noises in the extracted features and increasing the\nperformance of prediction. In overcoming mentioned challenges, this paper\nproposes Anatomical Pattern Analysis (APA) for decoding visual stimuli in the\nhuman brain. This framework develops a novel anatomical feature extraction\nmethod and a new imbalance AdaBoost algorithm for binary classification.\nFurther, it utilizes an Error-Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) method for\nmulti-class prediction. APA can automatically detect active regions for each\ncategory of the visual stimuli. Moreover, it enables us to combine homogeneous\ndatasets for applying advanced classification. Experimental studies on 4 visual\ncategories (words, consonants, objects and scrambled photos) demonstrate that\nthe proposed approach achieves superior performance to state-of-the-art\nmethods.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00921v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Joint Statistics of Strongly Correlated Neurons via Dimensional\n  Reduction', ['Taskin Deniz', 'Stefan Rotter'], u'2016-09-04', u'The relative timing of action potentials in neurons recorded from local\ncortical networks often shows a non-trivial dependence, which is then\nquantified by cross-correlation functions. Theoretical models emphasize that\nsuch spike train correlations are an inevitable consequence of two neurons\nbeing part of the same network and sharing some synaptic input. For non-linear\nneuron models, however, explicit correlation functions are difficult to compute\nanalytically, and perturbative methods work only for weak shared input. In\norder to treat strong correlations, we suggest here an alternative\nnon-perturbative method. Specifically, we study the case of two leaky\nintegrate-and-fire neurons with strong shared input. Correlation functions\nderived from simulated spike trains fit our theoretical predictions very\naccurately. Using our method, we computed the non-linear correlation transfer\nas well as correlation functions that are asymmetric due to inhomogeneous\nintrinsic parameters or unequal input.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00900v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

What are the\nneuronal mechanisms responsible for these changes and how does targeted\nstimulation by a BBCI shape population-level synaptic connectivity? The present\nwork describes a recurrent neural network model with probabilistic spiking\nmechanisms and plastic synapses capable of capturing both neural and synaptic\nactivity statistics relevant to BBCI conditioning protocols. When spikes from a\nneuron recorded at one MC site trigger stimuli at a second target site after a\nfixed delay, the connections between sites are strengthened for spike-stimulus\ndelays consistent with experimentally derived spike time dependent plasticity\n(STDP) rules. However, the relationship between STDP mechanisms at the level of\nnetworks, and their modification with neural implants remains poorly\nunderstood.

[u'The Accuracy of Mean-Field Approximation for\n  Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible Epidemic Spreading', ['Bo Qu', 'Huijuan Wang'], u'2016-09-05', u'The epidemic spreading has been studied for years by applying the mean-field\napproach in both homogeneous case, where each node may get infected by an\ninfected neighbor with the same rate, and heterogeneous case, where the\ninfection rates between different pairs of nodes are different. Researchers\nhave discussed whether the mean-field approaches could accurately describe the\nepidemic spreading for the homogeneous cases but not for the heterogeneous\ncases. In this paper, we explore under what conditions the mean-field approach\ncould perform well when the infection rates are heterogeneous. In particular,\nwe employ the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model and compare the\naverage fraction of infected nodes in the metastable state obtained by the\ncontinuous-time simulation and the mean-field approximation. We concentrate on\nan individual-based mean-field approximation called the N-intertwined Mean\nField Approximation (NIMFA), which is an advanced approach considered the\nunderlying network topology. Moreover, we consider not only the independent and\nidentically distributed (i.i.d.) infection rate but also the infection rate\ncorrelated with the degree of the two end nodes. We conclude that NIMFA is\ngenerally more accurate when the prevalence of the epidemic is higher. Given\nthe same effective infection rate, NIMFA is less accurate when the variance of\nthe i.i.d.\\ infection rate or the correlation between the infection rate and\nthe nodal degree leads to a lower prevalence. Moreover, given the same actual\nprevalence, NIMFA performs better in the cases: 1) when the variance of the\ni.i.d.\\ infection rates is smaller (while the average is unchanged); 2) when\nthe correlation between the infection rate and the nodal degree is positive.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01105v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

[u'Allometric scaling in-vitro', ['Arti Ahluwalia'], u'2016-09-04', u'The quarter power allometric scaling of mammalian metabolic rate is largely\nregarded as a universal law of biology. However, it is well known that cell\ncultures do not obey this law. The current thinking is that were in-vitro\ncultures to obey quarter power scaling, they would have more predictive power\nand could for instance provide a viable substitute for animals in research.\nAbout two decades ago, West and coworkers established a model which predicts\nthat metabolic rate follows a quarter power relationship with the mass of an\norganism, based on the premise that tissues are supplied nutrients through a\nfractal distribution network. This paper outlines a theoretical and\ncomputational framework for establishing quarter power scaling in-vitro,\nstarting where fractal distribution ends. Allometric scaling in non-vascular\nspherical tissue constructs was assessed using models of Michaelis Menten\noxygen consumption and diffusion. The results demonstrate that physiological\nscaling is maintained when about 5 to 60% of the construct is exposed to oxygen\nconcentrations less than the Michaelis Menten constant. In these conditions the\nThiele modulus is between 8 and 80, with a significant concentration gradient\nin the sphere.

Toxin-antitoxin systems enforce the\nmaintenance of a plasmid through post-segregational killing of cells that have\nlost the plasmid. Key to their function is the tight regulation of expression\nof a protein toxin by an sRNA antitoxin. Here, we focus on the nonlinear nature\nof the regulatory circuit dynamics of the toxin-antitoxin mechanism. The\nmechanism relies on a transient increase in protein concentration rather than\non the steady state of the genetic circuit. Through a systematic analysis of\nthe parameter dependence of this transient increase, we confirm some known\ndesign features of this system and identify new ones: for an efficient\ntoxin-antitoxin mechanism, the synthesis rate of the toxin's mRNA template\nshould be lower that of the sRNA antitoxin, the mRNA template should be more\nstable than the sRNA antitoxin, and the mRNA-sRNA complex should be more stable\nthan the sRNA antitoxin. Moreover, a short half-life of the protein toxin is\nalso beneficial to the function of the toxin-antitoxin system.

However, only a few previous\ncomputational studies have claimed success in revealing genome-wide regulatory\nlandscapes from temporal gene expression data, especially for complex\neukaryotes like human. Moreover, recent work suggests that these methods still\nsuffer from the curse of dimensionality if network size increases to 100 or\nhigher.\n  Result: We present a novel scalable algorithm for identifying genome-wide\nregulatory network structures. The highlight of our method is that its superior\nperformance does not degenerate even for a network size on the order of $10^4$,\nand is thus readily applicable to large-scale complex networks.
