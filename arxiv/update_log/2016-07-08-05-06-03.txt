Adkar', 'Mohammed Shabab', 'Jonathan A. King', 'Eugene I. Shakhnovich'], u'2016-07-07', u"Considerable mechanistic insight has been gained into amyloid aggregation;\nhowever, a large class of non-amyloid protein aggregates are considered\n'amorphous,' and in most cases little is known about their mechanisms.\nAmorphous aggregation of {\\gamma}-crystallins in the eye lens causes a\nwidespread disease of aging, cataract. We combined simulations and experiments\nto study the mechanism of aggregation of two {\\gamma}D-crystallin mutants, W42R\nand W42Q - the former a congenital cataract mutation, and the latter a mimic of\nage-related oxidative damage. We found that formation of an internal disulfide\nwas necessary and sufficient for aggregation under physiological conditions.\nTwo-chain all-atom simulations predicted that one non-native disulfide in\nparticular, between Cys32 and Cys41, was likely to stabilize an unfolding\nintermediate prone to intermolecular interactions. Mass spectrometry and\nmutagenesis experiments confirmed the presence of this bond in the aggregates\nand its necessity for oxidative aggregation under physiological conditions in\nvitro. Mining the simulation data linked formation of this disulfide to\nextrusion of the N-terminal \\b{eta}-hairpin and rearrangement of the native\n\\b{eta}-sheet topology. Specific binding between the extruded hairpin and a\ndistal \\b{eta}-sheet, in an intermolecular chain reaction similar to domain\nswapping, is the most probable mechanism of aggregate propagation.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02110v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'The Energy Landscape of Neurophysiological Activity Implicit in Brain\n  Network Structure', ['Shi Gu', 'Matthew Cieslak', 'Benjamin Baird', 'Sarah F. Muldoon', 'Scott T. Grafton', 'Fabio Pasqualetti', 'Danielle S. Bassett'], u'2016-07-07', u'A critical mystery in neuroscience lies in determining how anatomical\nstructure impacts the complex functional dynamics of human thought. How does\nlarge-scale brain circuitry constrain states of neuronal activity and\ntransitions between those states? We address these questions using a maximum\nentropy model of brain dynamics informed by white matter tractography. We\ndemonstrate that the most probable brain states -- characterized by minimal\nenergy -- display common activation profiles across brain areas: local\nspatially-contiguous sets of brain regions reminiscent of cognitive systems are\nco-activated frequently. The predicted activation rate of these systems is\nhighly correlated with the observed activation rate measured in a separate\nresting state fMRI data set, validating the utility of the maximum entropy\nmodel in describing neurophysiologial dynamics. This approach also offers a\nformal notion of the energy of activity within a system, and the energy of\nactivity shared between systems. We observe that within- and between-system\nenergies cleanly separate cognitive systems into distinct categories, optimized\nfor differential contributions to integrated v.s. segregated function. These\nresults support the notion that energetic and structural constraints\ncircumscribe brain dynamics, offering novel insights into the roles that\ncognitive systems play in driving whole-brain activation patterns.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01959v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

In this setup, any quadratic offspring interaction\ncan produce any type of offspring and after the use of specific changes of\nbasis, we study the evolution and possible stability of some examples.

[u'When Google Meets Lotka-Volterra', ['Lewi Stone'], u'2016-07-07', u'Mays celebrated theoretical work of the 70s contradicted the established\nparadigm by demonstrating that complexity leads to instability in biological\nsystems. Here Mays random-matrix modelling approach is generalized to realistic\nlarge-scale webs of species interactions, be they structured by networks of\ncompetition, mutualism or both. Simple relationships are found to govern these\notherwise intractable models, and control the parameter ranges for which\nbiological systems are stable and feasible. Our analysis of model and real\nempirical networks is only achievable upon introducing a simplifying\nGoogle-matrix reduction scheme, which in the process, yields a practical\necological eigenvalue stability index. These results provide an understanding\non how network topology, especially connectance, influences species stable\ncoexistence. Constraints controlling feasibility (positive equilibrium\npopulations) in these systems, are found more restrictive than those\ncontrolling stability, helping explain the enigma of why many classes of\nfeasible ecological models are nearly always stable.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01879v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Dynamic sampling and information encoding in biochemical networks', ['Garrett D. Potter', 'Tommy A. Byrd', 'Andrew Mugler', 'Bo Sun'], u'2016-07-06', u'Cells use biochemical networks to translate environmental information into\nintracellular responses. These responses can be highly dynamic, but how the\ninformation is encoded in these dynamics remains poorly understood. Here we\ninvestigate the dynamic encoding of information in the ATP-induced calcium\nresponses of fibroblast cells, using a vectorial, or multi-time-point, measure\nfrom information theory. We find that the amount of extracted information\ndepends on physiological constraints such as the sampling rate and memory\ncapacity of the downstream network, and is affected differentially by intrinsic\nvs. extrinsic noise. By comparing to a minimal physical model, we find,\nsurprisingly, that the information is often insensitive to the detailed\nstructure of the underlying dynamics, and instead the decoding mechanism acts\nas a simple low-pass filter. These results demonstrate the mechanisms and\nlimitations of dynamic information storage in cells.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01841v1', ['Cell Behavior'], []]
[u'DeepChrome: Deep-learning for predicting gene expression from histone\n  modifications', ['Ritambhara Singh', 'Jack Lanchantin', 'Gabriel Robins', 'Yanjun Qi'], u'2016-07-07', u"Motivation: Histone modifications are among the most important factors that\ncontrol gene regulation. Computational methods that predict gene expression\nfrom histone modification signals are highly desirable for understanding their\ncombinatorial effects in gene regulation. This knowledge can help in developing\n'epigenetic drugs' for diseases like cancer. Previous studies for quantifying\nthe relationship between histone modifications and gene expression levels\neither failed to capture combinatorial effects or relied on multiple methods\nthat separate predictions and combinatorial analysis. This paper develops a\nunified discriminative framework using a deep convolutional neural network to\nclassify gene expression using histone modification data as input. Our system,\ncalled DeepChrome, allows automatic extraction of complex interactions among\nimportant features. To simultaneously visualize the combinatorial interactions\namong histone modifications, we propose a novel optimization-based technique\nthat generates feature pattern maps from the learnt deep model. This provides\nan intuitive description of underlying epigenetic mechanisms that regulate\ngenes. Results: We show that DeepChrome outperforms state-of-the-art models\nlike Support Vector Machines and Random Forests for gene expression\nclassification task on 56 different cell-types from REMC database. The output\nof our visualization technique not only validates the previous observations but\nalso allows novel insights about combinatorial interactions among histone\nmodification marks, some of which have recently been observed by experimental\nstudies.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02078v1', ['Genomics'], []]
