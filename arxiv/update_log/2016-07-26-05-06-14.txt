[u'Modeling of Ribosome Dynamics on a ds-mRNA under an External Load', ['Bahareh Shakiba', 'Maryam Dayeri', 'Farshid Mohammad-Rafiee'], u'2016-07-25', u'Protein molecules in cells are synthesized by macromolecular machines called\nribosomes. According to recent experimental data, we reduce the complexity of\nthe ribosome and propose a model to express its activity in six main states.\nUsing our model, we study the translation rate in different biological relevant\nsituations in the presence of external force, and translation through the RNA\ndouble stranded region in the absence or presence of the external force. In the\npresent study, we give a quantitative theory for translation rate and show that\nthe ribosome behaves more like a Brownian Ratchet motor.

[u'Emergence of Sparsely Synchronized Rhythms and Their Responses to\n  External Stimuli in An Inhomogeneous Small-World Complex Neuronal Network', ['Sang-Yoon Kim', 'Woochang Lim'], u'2016-07-25', u'We consider an inhomogeneous small-world network (SWN) composed of inhibitory\nshort-range (SR) and long-range (LR) interneurons. By varying the fraction of\nLR interneurons $p_{long}$, we investigate the effect of network architecture\non emergence of sparsely synchronized rhythms, and make comparison with that in\nthe Watts-Strogatz SWN. Although SR and LR interneurons have the same average\nin- and out-degrees, their betweenness centralities (characterizing the\npotentiality in controlling communication between other interneurons) are\ndistinctly different. Hence, in view of the betweenness, SWNs we consider are\ninhomogeneous, unlike the "canonical" Watts-Strogatz SWN with nearly same\nbetweenness centralities. As $p_{long}$ is increased, the average path length\nbecomes shorter, and the load of communication traffic is less concentrated on\nLR interneurons, which leads to better efficiency of global communication\nbetween interneurons. Eventually, when passing a critical value\n$p_{long}^{(c)}$ $(\\simeq 0.16)$, sparsely synchronized rhythms are found to\nemerge. We also consider two cases of external time-periodic stimuli applied to\nsub-groups of LR and SR interneurons, respectively. Dynamical responses (such\nas synchronization suppression and enhancement) to these two cases of stimuli\nare studied and discussed in relation to the betweenness centralities of\nstimulated interneurons, representing the effectiveness for transfer of\nstimulation effect in the whole network.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.07139v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Neurophysiological Investigation of Context Modulation based on Musical\n  Stimulus', ['Siddharth Mehrotra', 'Anuj Shukla', 'Dipanjan Roy'], u'2016-07-23', u"There are numerous studies which suggest that perhaps music is truly the\nlanguage of emotions. Music seems to have an almost willful, evasive quality,\ndefying simple explanation, and indeed requires deeper neurophysiological\ninvestigations to gain a better understanding. The current study makes an\nattempt in that direction to explore the effect of context on music perception.\nTo investigate the same, we measured Galvanic Skin Responses (GSR) and\nself-reported emotion on 18 participants while listening to different Ragas\n(musical stimulus) composed of different Rasa's (emotional expression) in the\ndifferent context (Neutral, Pleasant, and Unpleasant). The IAPS pictures were\nused to induce the emotional context in participants. Our results from this\nstudy suggest that the context can modulate emotional response in music\nperception but only for a shorter time scale. Interestingly, here we\ndemonstrate by combining GSR and self-reports that this effect gradually\nvanishes over time and shows emotional adaptation irrespective of context. The\noverall findings suggest that specific context effects of music perception are\ntransitory in nature and gets saturated on a longer time scale.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06980v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

[u'Model-free immune therapy: A control approach to acute inflammation', ['Ouassim Bara', 'Michel Fliess', 'Cedric Join', 'Judy Day', 'Seddik M. Djouadi'], u'2016-07-25', u'Control of an inflammatory immune response is still an ongoing research.\nHere, a strategy consisting of manipulating a pro and anti-inflammatory\nmediator is considered. Already existing and promising model-based techniques\nsuffer unfortunately from a most difficult calibration. This is due to the\ndifferent types of inflammations and to the strong parameter variation between\npatients. This communication explores another route via the new model-free\ncontrol and its corresponding "intelligent" controllers. A "virtual" patient,\ni.e., a mathematical model, is only employed for digital simulations. A most\ninteresting feature of our control strategy is the fact that the two outputs\nwhich must be driven are sensorless. This difficulty is overcome by assigning\nsuitable reference trajectories to two other outputs with sensors. Several most\nencouraging computer simulations, corresponding to different drug treatment\nstrategies, are displayed and discussed.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.07259v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Integrative genetic risk prediction using nonparametric empirical Bayes\n  classification', ['Sihai Dave Zhao'], u'2016-07-23', u'Genetic risk prediction is an important component of individualized medicine,\nbut prediction accuracies remain low for many complex diseases. A fundamental\nlimitation is the sample sizes of the studies on which the prediction\nalgorithms are trained. One way to increase the effective sample size is to\nintegrate information from previously existing studies. However, it can be\ndifficult to find existing data that examine the target disease of interest,\nespecially if that disease is rare or poorly studied. Furthermore,\nindividual-level genotype data from these auxiliary studies are typically\ndifficult to obtain. This paper proposes a new approach to integrative genetic\nrisk prediction of complex diseases with binary phenotypes. It accommodates\npossible heterogeneity in the genetic etiologies of the target and auxiliary\ndiseases using a tuning parameter-free nonparametric empirical Bayes procedure,\nand can be trained using only auxiliary summary statistics. Simulation studies\nshow that the proposed method can provide superior predictive accuracy relative\nto non-integrative as well as integrative classifiers. The method is applied to\na recent study of pediatric autoimmune diseases, where it substantially reduces\nprediction error for certain target/auxiliary disease combinations. The\nproposed method is implemented in the R package ssa.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06976v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'An Empirical Biomarker-based Calculator for Autosomal Recessive\n  Polycystic Kidney Disease - The Nieto-Narayan Formula', ['Jake A. Nieto', 'Michael A. Yamin', 'Itzhak D. Goldberg', 'Prakash Narayan'], u'2016-07-25', u'Autosomal polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is associated with progressive\nenlargement of the kidneys fuelled by the formation and expansion of\nfluid-filled cysts. The disease is congenital and children that do not succumb\nto it during the neonatal period will, by age 10 years, more often than not,\nrequire nephrectomy+renal replacement therapy for management of both pain and\nrenal insufficiency. Since increasing cystic index (CI; percent of kidney\noccupied by cysts) drives both renal expansion and organ dysfunction,\nmanagement of these patients, including decisions such as elective nephrectomy\nand prioritization on the transplant waitlist, could clearly benefit from\nserial determination of CI. So also, clinical trials in ARPKD evaluating the\nefficacy of novel drug candidates could benefit from serial determination of\nCI. Although ultrasound is currently the imaging modality of choice for\ndiagnosis of ARPKD, its utilization for assessing disease progression is highly\nlimited. Magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography, although more\nreliable for determination of CI, are expensive, time-consuming and somewhat\nimpractical in the pediatric population. Using a well-established mammalian\nmodel of ARPKD, we undertook a big data-like analysis of minimally- or\nnon-invasive serum and urine biomarkers of renal injury/dysfunction to derive a\nfamily of equations for estimating CI. We then applied a signal averaging\nprotocol to distill these equations to a single empirical formula for\ncalculation of CI. Such a formula will eventually find use in identifying and\nmonitoring patients at high risk for progressing to end-stage renal disease and\naid in the conduct of clinical trials.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.07359v1', ['Tissues and Organs'], []]

We combine experimental measurements with theoretical modeling\nto quantitatively describe the integration mode of these opposing signals. We\npropose a two step integration model that modulates the effect of the two types\nof signals: an initial bottleneck integrates both signals (IL-10 and\nTNF$\\alpha$), the output of which is later modulated by the anti-inflammatory\nsignal. We show that the anti-inflammatory IL-10 signaling is long ranged, as\nopposed to the short-ranged pro-inflammatory TNF$\\alpha$ signaling.
