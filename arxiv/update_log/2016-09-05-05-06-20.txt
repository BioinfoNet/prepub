[u'Accurate De Novo Prediction of Protein Contact Map by Ultra-Deep\n  Learning Model', ['Sheng Wang', 'Siqi Sun', 'Zhen Li', 'Renyu Zhang', 'Jinbo Xu'], u'2016-09-02', u'Protein contact prediction from sequence is an important problem. Recently\nexciting progress has been made on this problem, but the predicted contacts for\nproteins without many sequence homologs is still of low quality and not very\nuseful for de novo structure prediction. This paper presents a new deep\nlearning method for contact prediction that predicts contacts by integrating\nboth evolutionary coupling (EC) information and sequence conservation\ninformation through an ultra-deep neural network consisting of two deep\nresidual neural networks. The two residual networks conduct a series of\nconvolutional transformation of protein features including sequence profile, EC\ninformation and pairwise potential. This neural network allows us to model very\ncomplex relationship between sequence and contact map as well as long-range\ninterdependency between contacts and thus, obtain high-quality contact\nprediction.\n  Our method greatly outperforms existing contact prediction methods and leads\nto much more accurate contact-assisted protein folding. For example, on the 105\nCASP11 test proteins, the L/10 long-range accuracy obtained by our method is\n83.3% while that by CCMpred and MetaPSICOV (the CASP11 winner) is 43.4% and\n60.2%, respectively. On the 398 membrane proteins, the L/10 long-range accuracy\nobtained by our method is 79.6% while that by CCMpred and MetaPSICOV is 51.8%\nand 61.2%, respectively. Ab initio folding guided by our predicted contacts can\nyield correct folds (i.e., TMscore>0.6) for 224 of the 579 test proteins, while\nthat by MetaPSICOV- and CCMpred-predicted contacts can do so for only 79 and 62\nof them, respectively. Further, our contact-assisted models also have much\nbetter quality (especially for membrane proteins) than template-based models.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00680v1', ['Biomolecules', 'Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Fast Active Set Methods for Online Deconvolution of Calcium Imaging Data', ['Johannes Friedrich', 'Pengcheng Zhou', 'Liam Paninski'], u'2016-09-02', u'Fluorescent calcium indicators are a popular means for observing the spiking\nactivity of large neuronal populations, but extracting the activity of each\nneuron from raw fluorescence calcium imaging data is a nontrivial problem. We\npresent a fast online active set method to solve this sparse non-negative\ndeconvolution problem. Importantly, the algorithm progresses through each time\nseries sequentially from beginning to end, thus enabling real-time online\nestimation of neural activity during the imaging session. Our algorithm is a\ngeneralization of the pool adjacent violators algorithm (PAVA) for isotonic\nregression and inherits its linear-time computational complexity. We gain\nremarkable increases in processing speed: more than one order of magnitude\ncompared to currently employed state of the art convex solvers relying on\ninterior point methods. Our method can exploit warm starts; therefore\noptimizing model hyperparameters only requires a handful of passes through the\ndata. The algorithm enables real-time simultaneous deconvolution of $O(10^5)$\ntraces of whole-brain larval zebrafish imaging data on a laptop.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00639v1', ['Neurons and Cognition', 'Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Mapping how local perturbations influence systems-level brain dynamics', ['Leonardo L. Gollo', 'James A. Roberts', 'Luca Cocchi'], u'2016-09-02', u"The human brain exhibits a relatively stable spatiotemporal organization that\nsupports brain function and can be manipulated via local brain stimulation.\nSuch perturbations to local cortical dynamics are globally integrated by\ndistinct neural systems. However, it remains unclear how and why local changes\nin neural activity affect large-scale system dynamics. Here, we briefly review\nempirical and computational studies addressing how localized perturbations\naffect brain activity. We then systematically analyze a model of large-scale\nbrain dynamics, assessing how localized changes in brain activity at the\ndifferent sites affect whole-brain dynamics. We find that local stimulation\ninduces changes in brain activity that can be summarized by relatively smooth\ntuning curves, which relate a region's effectiveness as a stimulation site to\nits position within the cortical hierarchy. Our results also support the notion\nthat brain hubs, operating in a slower regime, are more resilient to focal\nperturbations and critically contribute to maintain stability in global brain\ndynamics. In contrast, perturbations of peripheral regions, characterized by\nfaster activity, have greater impact on functional connectivity. As a parallel\nwith this region-level result, we also find that peripheral systems such as the\nvisual and sensorimotor networks were more affected by local perturbations than\nhigh-level systems such as the cingulo-opercular network. Our results highlight\nthe importance of a periphery-to-core hierarchy to determine the effect of\nlocal stimulation on the brain network. We also provide novel resources to\norient empirical work aiming at manipulating functional connectivity using\nnon-invasive brain stimulation.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00491v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

[u'Bone Remodeling as a Spatial Evolutionary Game', ['Marc D. Ryser', 'Kevin A. Murgas'], u'2016-09-02', u'Bone remodeling is a complex process involving cell-cell interactions,\nbiochemical signaling and mechanical stimuli. Early models of the biological\naspects of remodeling were non-spatial and focused on the local dynamics at a\nfixed location in the bone. Several spatial extensions of these models have\nbeen proposed, but they generally suffer from two limitations: first, they are\nnot amenable to analysis and are computationally expensive, and second, they\nneglect the role played by bone-embedded osteocytes. To address these issues,\nwe developed a novel model of spatial remodeling based on the principles of\nevolutionary game theory. The analytically tractable framework describes the\nspatial interactions between zones of bone resorption, bone formation and\nquiescent bone, and explicitly accounts for regulation of remodeling by\nbone-embedded, mechanotransducing osteocytes. Using tools from the theory of\ninteracting particle systems we systematically classified the different dynamic\nregimes of the spatial model and identified regions of parameter space that\nallow for coexistence of resorption, formation and quiescence, as observed in\nphysiological remodeling. In coexistence scenarios, three-dimensional\nsimulations revealed the emergence of sponge-like bone clusters. Comparison\nbetween spatial and non-spatial dynamics revealed substantial differences and\nsuggested a stabilizing role of space. Our findings emphasize the importance of\naccounting for spatial structure and bone-embedded osteocytes when modeling the\nprocess of bone remodeling. Thanks to the lattice-based framework, the proposed\nmodel can easily be coupled to a mechanical model of bone loading.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00620v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Species coexistence in a neutral dynamics with environmental noise', ['Jorge Hidalgo', 'Samir Suweis', 'Amos Maritan'], u'2016-09-02', u"Environmental fluctuations have important consequences in the organization of\necological communities, and understanding how such variability influences the\nbiodiversity of an ecosystem is a major question in ecology. In this paper, we\nanalyze the case of two species competing for the resources within the\nframework of the neutral theory where we introduce environmental noise,\ndevoting special attention on how such variability modulates species fitness.\nThe environment is dichotomous and stochastically alternates between periods\nfavoring one of the species while disfavoring the other one, preserving\nneutrality on the long term. We study two different scenarios: in the first one\nspecies fitness varies linearly with the environment, and in the second one the\neffective fitness is re-scaled by the total fitness of the individuals\ncompeting for the same resource. We find that, in the former case environmental\nfluctuations always reduce the time of species coexistence, whereas such a time\ncan be enhanced or reduced in the latter case, depending on the correlation\ntime of the environment. This phenomenon can be understood as a direct\nconsequence of the Chesson's storage effect.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00520v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Network reconstruction from infection cascades', ['Alfredo Braunstein', 'Alessandro Ingrosso'], u'2016-09-02', u"Reconstructing propagation networks from observations is a fundamental\ninverse problem, and it's crucial to understand and control dynamics in complex\nsystems. Here we show that it is possible to reconstruct the whole structure of\nan interaction network and to simultaneously infer the complete time course of\nactivation spreading, relying just on single snapshots of a small number of\nactivity cascades. The method, that we called Inverse Dynamics Network\nReconstruction (IDNR), is shown to work successfully on several synthetic and\nreal networks, inferring the networks and the sources of infection based on\nsparse observations, including single snapshots. IDNR is built on a Belief\nPropagation approximation, that has an impressive performance in a wide variety\nof topological structures. The method can be applied in absence of complete\ntime-series data by providing a detailed modeling of the posterior distribution\nof trajectories conditioned to the observations. Furthermore, we show by\nexperiments that the information content of full cascades is relatively smaller\nthan that of sparse observations or single snapshots.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00432v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

[u'Non-equilibrium fluctuations of a semi-flexible filament driven by\n  active cross-linkers', ['Ines Weber', 'Cecile Appert-Rolland', 'Gregory Schehr', 'Ludger Santen'], u'2016-09-02', u'The cytoskeleton is an inhomogeneous network of semi-flexible filaments,\nwhich are involved in a wide variety of active biological processes. Although\nthe cytoskeletal filaments can be very stiff and embedded in a dense and\ncross-linked network, it has been shown that, in cells, they typically exhibit\nsignificant bending on all length scales. In this work we propose a model of a\nsemi-flexible filament deformed by different types of cross-linkers for which\none can compute and investigate the bending spectrum. Our model allows to\ncouple the evolution of the deformation of the semi-flexible polymer with the\nstochastic dynamics of linkers which exert transversal forces onto the\nfilament. We observe a $q^{-2}$ dependence of the bending spectrum for some\nbiologically relevant parameters and in a certain range of wavenumbers $q$.\nHowever, generically, the spatially localized forcing and the non-thermal\ndynamics both introduce deviations from the thermal-like $q^{-2}$ spectrum.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00557v1', ['Subcellular Processes'], []]
