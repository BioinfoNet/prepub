[u'Tension-dependent Free Energies of Nucleosome Unwrapping', ['Joshua Lequieu', 'Andres Cordoba', 'David C. Schwartz', 'Juan J. de Pablo'], u'2016-07-19', u'Nucleosomes form the basic unit of compaction within eukaryotic genomes and\ntheir locations represent an important, yet poorly understood, mechanism of\ngenetic regulation. Quantifying the strength of interactions within the\nnucleosome is a central problem in biophysics and is critical to understanding\nhow nucleosome positions influence gene expression. By comparing to\nsingle-molecule experiments, we demonstrate that a coarse-grained molecular\nmodel of the nucleosome can reproduce key aspects of nucleosome unwrapping.\nUsing detailed simulations of DNA and histone proteins, we calculate the\ntension-dependent free energy surface corresponding to the unwrapping process.\nThe model reproduces quantitatively the forces required to unwrap the\nnucleosome, and reveals the role played by electrostatic interactions during\nthis process. We then demonstrate that histone modifications and DNA sequence\ncan have significant effects on the energies of nucleosome formation. Most\nnotably, we show that histone tails are crucial for stabilizing the outer turn\nof nucleosomal DNA.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.05742v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Automatic parametrization of implicit solvent models for the blind\n  prediction of solvation free energies', ['Bao Wang', 'Chengzhang Wang', 'Guowei Wei'], u'2016-07-10', u'In this work, a systematic protocol is proposed to automatically parametrize\nimplicit solvent models with polar and nonpolar components. The proposed\nprotocol utilizes the classical Poisson model or the Kohn-Sham density\nfunctional theory (KSDFT) based polarizable Poisson model for modeling polar\nsolvation free energies. For the nonpolar component, either the standard model\nof surface area, molecular volume, and van der Waals interactions, or a model\nwith atomic surface areas and molecular volume is employed. Based on the\nassumption that similar molecules have similar parametrizations, we develop\nscoring and ranking algorithms to classify solute molecules. Four sets of\nradius parameters are combined with four sets of charge force fields to arrive\nat a total of 16 different parametrizations for the Poisson model. A large\ndatabase with 668 experimental data is utilized to validate the proposed\nprotocol. The lowest leave-one-out root mean square (RMS) error for the\ndatabase is 1.33k cal/mol. Additionally, five subsets of the database, i.e.,\nSAMPL0-SAMPL4, are employed to further demonstrate that the proposed protocol\noffers some of the best solvation predictions. The optimal RMS errors are 0.93,\n2.82, 1.90, 0.78, and 1.03 kcal/mol, respectively for SAMPL0, SAMPL1, SAMPL2,\nSAMPL3, and SAMPL4 test sets. These results are some of the best, to our best\nknowledge.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06037v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Mechanosensing in myosin filament solves a 60 years old conflict in\n  skeletal muscle modeling between high power output and slow rise in tension', ['Lorenzo Marcucci', 'Carlo Reggiani'], u'2016-07-20', u'Almost 60 years ago Andrew Huxley with his seminal paper \\cite{Huxley1957}\nlaid the foundation of modern muscle modeling, linking chemical events to\nmechanical performance. He described mechanics and energetics of muscle\ncontraction through the cyclical attachment and detachment of myosin motors to\nthe actin filament with ad hoc assumptions on the dependence of the rate\nconstants on the strain of the myosin motors. That relatively simple hypothesis\nis still present in recent models, even though with several modifications to\nadapt the model to the different experimental constraints which became\nsubsequently available. However, already in that paper, one controversial\naspect of the model became clear. Relatively high attachment and detachment\nrates of myosin to the actin filament were needed to simulate the high power\noutput at intermediate velocity of contraction. However, these rates were\nincompatible with the relatively slow rise in tension after activation, despite\nthe rise should be generated by the same rate functions. This discrepancy has\nnot been fully solved till today, despite several hypotheses have been\nforwarded to reconcile the two aspects. Here, using a conventional muscle\nmodel, we show that the recently revealed mechanosensing mechanism of\nrecruitment of myosin motors \\cite{Linarietal2015} can solve this long standing\nproblem without any further ad-hoc hypotheses.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.05855v1', ['Quantitative Methods', 'Subcellular Processes'], []]
[u'Characterization and reduction of variability in selection based on\n  effect-size using association measures in cohort study of heterogeneous\n  diseases', ['Venkateshan Kannan', 'Kristina Alexandersson', 'Jesper Tegner'], u'2016-07-20', u'Epidemiological studies employ pairwise measures of association to quantify\ndependencies among diseases and exposures. The reliable use of these measures\nto draw conclusions about the underlying association strengths requires that\nthe measures have no undue dependencies that systematically distort their\nvalues. These conditions are particularly relevant when multiple pairwise\nassociations are compared and ranked in a cohort study, as in the case of\nconstruction of disease networks. Following an empirical approach and using\ndisease diagnoses data from a large cohort of 5.5 million patients as a test\nset, we develop a comprehensive methodology to characterize the variability of\nmeasures in selection of disease pairs based on effect-size. Specifically, we\ndefine putative bias variables, and examine the distribution of the measure\nscores conditioned upon it. This procedure reveals systematic bias in widely\nused measures such as relative risk and correlation coefficient. In addition,\nwe devise a novel measure family using a stochastic model for differential rate\nof development of diseases. We demonstrate marked reduction in above-mentioned\nbias with an appropriate choice from this measure family.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.05826v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
