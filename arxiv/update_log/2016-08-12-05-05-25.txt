[u'Closures and Cavities in the Human Connectome', ['Ann Sizemore', 'Chad Giusti', 'Richard F. Betzel', 'Danielle S. Bassett'], u'2016-08-11', u'Encoding brain regions and their connections as a network of nodes and edges\ncaptures many of the possible paths along which information can be transmitted\nas humans process and perform complex behaviors. Because cognitive processes\ninvolve large and distributed networks of brain areas, examinations of\nmulti-node routes within larger connection patterns can offer fundamental\ninsights into the complexities of brain function. Here, we investigate both\ndensely connected groups of nodes that could perform local computations as well\nas larger patterns of interactions that would allow for parallel processing.\nFinding such structures necessitates we move from considering exclusively\npairwise interactions to capturing higher order relations, considerations\nnaturally expressed in the language of algebraic topology. In this parlance,\nclusters of all-to-all connected sets of brain regions that may readily share\ninformation to perform a coordinated function are called \\emph{cliques}. We\ndetect cliques in the average structural connectomes of 8 healthy adults\nscanned in triplicate and discover the presence of more high-dimensional\ncliques than expected in null networks constructed via wiring minimization.\nThis provides architecture through which brain network can perform rapid, local\nprocessing. Complementary to theis study of locally dense structures, we employ\na tool called \\emph{persistent homology} to locate \\emph{cycles}, topological\ncavities of different dimensions, around which information may flow in either\ndiverging or converging patterns. These cycles exist consistently across\nsubjects, differ from those observed in null model networks, and -- importantly\n-- link regions of early and late evolutionary origin in long loops,\nunderscoring their unique role in controlling brain function.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03520v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Modulation of sensory information processing by a neuroglobin in C.\n  elegans', ['Shigekazu Oda', 'Yu Toyoshima', 'Mario de Bono'], u'2016-08-11', u'Sensory receptor neurons match their dynamic range to ecologically relevant\nstimulus intensities. How this tuning is achieved is poorly understood in most\nreceptors. We show that in the C. elegans URX O2 sensing neurons two putative\nmolecular O2 sensors, a neuroglobin and O2-binding soluble guanylate cyclases,\nwork antagonistically to sculpt a sharp sigmoidal O2 response curve tuned to\napproach saturation when O2 reaches 21%. glb-5 imposes this sigmoidal function\nby inhibiting O2-evoked Ca2+ responses in URX when O2 levels fall. Without\nGLB-5, the URX response curve approaches saturation at 15% O2. Behaviorally,\nGLB-5 signaling broadens the O2 preference of C. elegans while maintaining\nstrong avoidance of 21% O2. Our computational aerotaxis model suggests that the\nrelationship between GLB-5-modulated URX responses and reversal behavior is\nsufficient to broaden O2-preference. Thus, a neuroglobin can shift neural\ninformation coding leading to a change in perception and altered behavior.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03477v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

Here,\nwe approach this question with a deep convolutional neural network that mimics\nneuronal circuitry and coding, and learns to solve computer vision tasks. Using\nthis network as a computational model of the visual cor-tex, we develop novel\nencoding and decoding mod-els to describe the bi-directional relationships\nbe-tween visual input and cortical activity measured with functional magnetic\nresonance imaging. Test-ing these models with imaging data from humans watching\nnatural movies, we show that the encod-ing model can predict cortical responses\nand re-trieve visual representations at individual brain lo-cations, and that\nthe decoding model can decipher the measured cortical activity to reconstruct\nthe visual and semantic experiences. Both the encod-ing and decoding models\nutilize cortical representa-tions of hierarchical, invariant, and nonlinear\nvisual features. Being self-contained, efficient, and gener-alizable, these\nmodels constitute a computational workbench for high-throughput investigation\nof all stages of visual processing.

Herrmann'], u'2016-08-10', u'Neuronal avalanches measured in vitro and in vivo in different cortical\nnetworks consistently exhibit power law behaviour for the size and duration\ndistributions with exponents typical for a mean field self-organized branching\nprocess. These exponents are also recovered in neuronal network simulations\nimplementing various neuronal dynamics on different network topologies. They\ncan therefore be considered a very robust feature of spontaneous neuronal\nactivity. Interestingly, this scaling behaviour is also observed on regular\nlattices in finite dimensions, which raises the question about the origin of\nthe mean field behaviour observed experimentally. In this study we provide an\nanswer to this open question by investigating the effect of activity dependent\nplasticity in combination with the neuronal refractory time in a neuronal\nnetwork. Results show that the refractory time hinders backward avalanches\nforcing a directed propagation. Hebbian plastic adaptation plays the role of\nsculpting these directed avalanche patterns into the topology of the network\nslowly changing it into a branched structure where loops are marginal.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03467v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

We challenge this\nreductionist assumption by demonstrating that, once causal power is properly\ndefined and measured, it is possible for a macro level to 'beat' the micro\nlevel. Here, this was done through a principled, well-defined measure of\nintrinsic cause-effect power - integrated information ({\\Phi}). Simple systems\nwere evaluated for {\\Phi} across different spatial and temporal scales by\nsystematically considering all possible black boxes. These are macro elements\nthat consist of one or more micro elements over one or more micro time steps.\nCause-effect power was evaluated based on the inputs and outputs of the black\nboxes, ignoring the internal mechanisms that support their function. We show\nthat a macro, black-box system can have higher {\\Phi} than its micro\nconstituents either by implementing more selective mechanisms (lower\ndegeneracy) or by composing a system having more common inputs and outputs\n(higher integration). We also show that, for a given micro system, one can\nidentify local maxima of {\\Phi} across several spatiotemporal scales. These\nlocal maxima correspond to macro levels of organization at which causal\nfeatures of physical systems emerge, and provide a natural focus for scientific\ninquiries.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03461v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

[u'Demographic noise can reverse the direction of deterministic selection', ['George W. A. Constable', 'Tim Rogers', 'Alan J. McKane', 'Corina E. Tarnita'], u'2016-08-11', u'Deterministic evolutionary theory robustly predicts that populations\ndisplaying altruistic behaviours will be driven to extinction by mutant cheats\nthat absorb common benefits but do not themselves contribute. Here we show that\nwhen demographic stochasticity is accounted for, selection can in fact act in\nthe reverse direction to that predicted deterministically, instead favouring\ncooperative behaviors that appreciably increase the carrying capacity of the\npopulation. Populations that exist in larger numbers experience a selective\nadvantage by being more stochastically robust to invasions than smaller\npopulations, and this advantage can persist even in the presence of\nreproductive costs. We investigate this general effect in the specific context\nof public goods production and find conditions for stochastic selection\nreversal leading to the success of public good producers. This insight,\ndeveloped here analytically, is missed by both the deterministic analysis as\nwell as standard game theoretic models that enforce a fixed population size.\nThe effect is found to be ampli?ed by space; in this scenario we find that\nselection reversal occurs within biologically reasonable parameter regimes for\nmicrobial populations. Beyond the public good problem, we formulate a general\nmathematical framework for models that may exhibit stochastic selection\nreversal. In this context, we describe a stochastic analogue to r-K theory, by\nwhich small populations can evolve to higher densities in the absence of\ndisturbance.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03471v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Patterns of Selection of Human Movements I: Movement Utility, Metabolic\n  Energy, and Normal Walking Gaits', ['Stuart Hagler'], u'2016-08-11', u'The biomechanics of the human body allow humans a range of possible ways of\nexecuting movements to attain specific goals. Nevertheless, humans exhibit\nsignificant patterns in how they execute movements. We propose that the\nobserved patterns of human movement arise because subjects select those ways to\nexecute movements that are, in a rigorous sense, optimal. In this project, we\nshow how this proposition can guide the development of computational models of\nmovement selection and thereby account for human movement patterns. We proceed\nby first developing a movement utility formalism that operationalizes the\nconcept of a best or optimal way of executing a movement using a utility\nfunction so that the problem of movement selection becomes the problem of\nfinding the movement that maximizes the utility function. Since the movement\nutility formalism includes a contribution of the metabolic energy of the\nmovement (maximum utility movements try to minimize metabolic energy), we also\ndevelop a metabolic energy formalism that we can use to construct estimators of\nthe metabolic energies of particular movements. We then show how we can\nconstruct an estimator for the metabolic energies of normal walking gaits and\nwe use that estimator to construct a movement utility model of the selection of\nnormal walking gaits and show that the relationship between avg. walking speed\nand avg. step length predicted by this model agrees with observation. We\nconclude by proposing a physical mechanism that a subject might use to estimate\nthe metabolic energy of a movement in practice.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03583v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Semi-Supervised Prediction of Gene Regulatory Networks Using Machine\n  Learning Algorithms', ['Nihir Patel', 'Jason T. L.

[u'Emergence of Dynamic Cooperativity in the Stochastic Kinetics of\n  Fluctuating Enzymes', ['Ashutosh Kumar', 'Sambarta Chatterjee', 'Mintu Nandi', 'Arti Dua'], u'2016-08-11', u'Dynamic cooperativity in monomeric enzymes is characterized in terms of a\nnon-Michaelis-Menten kinetic behaviour. The latter is believed to be associated\nwith mechanisms that include multiple reaction pathways due to enzymatic\nconformational fluctuations. Recent advances in single-molecule fluorescence\nspectroscopy have provided new fundamental insights on the possible mechanisms\nunderlying reactions catalyzed by fluctuating enzymes. Here, we present a\nbottom-up approach to understand enzyme turnover kinetics at physiologically\nrelevant mesoscopic concentrations informed by mechanisms extracted from\nsingle-molecule stochastic trajectories. The stochastic approach, presented\nhere, shows the emergence of dynamic cooperativity in terms of a slowing down\nof the Michaelis-Menten (MM) kinetics resulting in negative cooperativity. For\nfewer enzymes, dynamic cooperativity emerges due to the combined effects of\nenzymatic conformational fluctuations and molecular discreteness. The increase\nin the number of enzymes, however, suppresses the effect of enzymatic\nconformational fluctuations such that dynamic cooperativity emerges solely due\nto the discrete changes in the number of reacting species. These results\nconfirm that the turnover kinetics of fluctuating enzyme based on the\nparallel-pathway MM mechanism switches over to the single-pathway MM mechanism\nwith the increase in the number of enzymes. For large enzyme numbers,\nconvergence to the exact MM equation occurs in the limit of very high substrate\nconcentration as the stochastic kinetics approaches the deterministic\nbehaviour.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03379v1', ['Subcellular Processes'], []]
