[u'Direct measurements reveal non-Markovian fluctuations of DNA threading\n  through a solid-state nanopore', ['Nicholas A. W. Bell', 'Ulrich F. Keyser'], u'2016-07-15', u'The threading of a polymer chain through a small pore is a classic problem in\npolymer dynamics and underlies nanopore sensing technology. However important\nexperimental aspects of the polymer motion in a solid-state nanopore, such as\nan accurate measurement of the velocity variation during translocation, have\nremained elusive. In this work we analysed the translocation through conical\nquartz nanopores of a 7 kbp DNA double-strand labelled with six markers equally\nspaced along its contour. These markers, constructed from DNA hairpins, give\ndirect experimental access to the translocation dynamics. On average we measure\na 5% reduction in velocity during the translocation. We also find a striking\ncorrelation in velocity fluctuations with a decay constant of 100s of {\\mu}s.\nThese results shed light on hitherto unresolved problems in the dynamics of DNA\ntranslocation and provide guidance for experiments seeking to determine\npositional information along a DNA strand.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04612v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Enumerating secondary structures and structural moieties for circular\n  RNAs', ['Jose A. Cuesta', 'Susanna Manrubia'], u'2016-07-15', u'A quantitative characterization of the relationship between molecular\nsequence and structure is essential to improve our understanding of how\nfunction emerges. This particular genotype-phenotype map has been often studied\nin the context of RNA sequences, with the folded configurations standing as a\nproxy for the phenotype. Here, we count the secondary structures of circular\nRNAs of length $n$ and calculate the asymptotic distributions of different\nstructural moieties, such as stems or hairpin loops, by means of symbolic\ncombinatorics. Circular RNAs differ in essential ways from their linear\ncounterparts. From the mathematical viewpoint, the enumeration of the\ncorresponding secondary structures demands the use of combinatorial techniques\nadditional to those used for linear RNAs. The asymptotic number of secondary\nstructures for circular RNAs grows as $a^nn^{-5/2}$, with a depending on\nparticular constraints applied to the secondary structure. The abundance of any\nstructural moiety is normally distributed in the limit $n\\to\\infty$, with a\nmean and a variance that increase linearly with $n$.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04435v1', ['Biomolecules', 'Populations and Evolution', 'Molecular Networks'], []]
[u'Accurate, robust and reliable calculations of Poisson-Boltzmann\n  solvation energies', ['Bao Wang', 'Guowei Wei'], u'2016-07-10', u"Developing accurate solvers for the Poisson Boltzmann (PB) model is the first\nstep to make the PB model suitable for implicit solvent simulation. Reducing\nthe grid size influence on the performance of the solver benefits to increasing\nthe speed of solver and providing accurate electrostatics analysis for solvated\nmolecules. In this work, we explore the accurate coarse grid PB solver based on\nthe Green's function treatment of the singular charges, matched interface and\nboundary (MIB) method for treating the geometric singularities, and posterior\nelectrostatic potential field extension for calculating the reaction field\nenergy. We made our previous PB software, MIBPB, robust and provides almost\ngrid size independent reaction field energy calculation. Large amount of the\nnumerical tests verify the grid size independence merit of the MIBPB software.\nThe advantage of MIBPB software directly make the acceleration of the PB solver\nfrom the numerical algorithm instead of utilization of advanced computer\narchitectures.

[u'Random projections of random manifolds', ['Subhaneil Lahiri', 'Peiran Gao', 'Surya Ganguli'], u'2016-07-14', u'A ubiquitous phenomenon is that interesting signals or data concentrate on\nlow dimensional smooth manifolds inside a high dimensional ambient Euclidean\nspace. Random projections are a simple and powerful tool for dimensionality\nreduction of such signals and data. Previous, seminal works have studied bounds\non how the number of projections needed to preserve the geometry of these\nmanifolds, at a given accuracy, scales with the intrinsic dimensionality,\nvolume and curvature of the manifold. However, such works employ definitions of\nvolume and curvature that are inherently difficult to compute. Therefore such\ntheory cannot be easily tested against numerical simulations to quantitatively\nunderstand the tightness of the proven bounds. We instead study the typical\ndistortions arising in random projections of an ensemble of smooth Gaussian\nrandom manifolds. In doing so, we find explicitly computable, approximate\ntheoretical bounds on the number of projections required to preserve the\ngeometric structure of these manifolds to a prescribed level of accuracy. Our\nbounds, while approximate, can only be violated with a probability that is\nexponentially small in the ambient dimension, and therefore they hold with high\nprobability in most cases of practical interest. Moreover, unlike previous\nwork, we test our theoretical bounds against numerical experiments on the\nactual geometric distortions that typically occur for random projections of\nrandom smooth manifolds. Through this comparison, we find our bounds are\ntighter than previous results by several orders of magnitude.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04331v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

[u'Rate Matrix Estimation From Site Frequency Data', ['Conrad J.

The procedure assumes (1) that the data are\nobtained from a constant size population evolving according to a stationary\nWright-Fisher model; (2) that the data consist of a multiple alignment of a\nmoderate number of sequenced genomes drawn randomly from the population; and\n(3) that within the genome a large number of independent, neutral sites\nevolving with with a common mutation rate matrix can be identified. No\nrestrictions are imposed on the scaled rate matrix other than that the\noff-diagonal elements are positive and <<1, and that the rows sum to zero.

We observed that, in our population, cancer\ncells cooperate with each other to reach a common objective, but without\nnecessarily having the same metabolic traits.

Especially, estimating the quality of a single protein model, which\nis important for selecting a few good models out of a large model pool\nconsisting of mostly low-quality models, is still a largely unsolved problem.\nWe introduce a novel single-model quality assessment method DeepQA based on\ndeep belief network that utilizes a number of selected features describing the\nquality of a model from different perspectives, such as energy, physio-chemical\ncharacteristics, and structural information. The deep belief network is trained\non several large datasets consisting of models from the Critical Assessment of\nProtein Structure Prediction (CASP) experiments, several publicly available\ndatasets, and models generated by our in-house ab initio method.

[u'The Influence of Canalization on the Robustness of Boolean Networks', ['Claus Kadelka', 'Jack Kuipers', 'Reinhard Laubenbacher'], u'2016-07-15', u'Time- and state-discrete dynamical systems are frequently used to model\nmolecular networks. This paper provides a collection of mathematical and\ncomputational tools for the study of robustness in Boolean network models. The\nfocus is on networks governed by $k$-canalizing functions, a recently\nintroduced class of Boolean functions that contains the well-studied class of\nnested canalizing functions. The activities and sensitivity of a function\nquantify the impact of input changes on the function output. This paper\ngeneralizes the latter concept to $c$-sensitivity and provides formulas for the\nactivities and $c$-sensitivity of general $k$-canalizing functions as well as\ncanalizing functions with more precisely defined structure. A popular measure\nfor the robustness of a network, the Derrida value, can be expressed as a\nweighted sum of the $c$-sensitivities of the governing canalizing functions,\nand can also be calculated for a stochastic extension of Boolean networks.\nThese findings provide a computationally efficient way to obtain Derrida values\nof Boolean networks, deterministic or stochastic, that does not involve\nsimulation.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04474v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
