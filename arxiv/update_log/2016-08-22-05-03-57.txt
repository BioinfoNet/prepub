[u'Robust information propagation through noisy neural circuits', ['Joel Zylberberg', 'Alexandre Pouget', 'Peter E. Latham', 'Eric Shea-Brown'], u'2016-08-19', u'Sensory neurons give highly variable responses to stimulation, which can\nlimit the amount of stimulus information available to downstream circuits. Much\nwork has investigated the factors that affect the amount of information encoded\nin these population responses, leading to insights about the role of\ncovariability among neurons, tuning curve shape, etc. However, the\ninformativeness of neural responses is not the only relevant feature of\npopulation codes; of potentially equal importance is how robustly that\ninformation propagates to downstream structures. For instance, to quantify the\nretina\'s performance, one must consider not only the informativeness of the\noptic nerve responses, but also the amount of information that survives the\nspike-generating nonlinearity and noise corruption in the next stage of\nprocessing, the lateral geniculate nucleus. Our study identifies the set of\ncovariance structures for the upstream cells that optimize the ability of\ninformation to propagate through noisy, nonlinear circuits. Within this optimal\nfamily are covariances with "differential correlations", which are known to\nreduce the information encoded in neural population activities. Thus,\ncovariance structures that maximize information in neural population codes, and\nthose that maximize the ability of this information to propagate, can be very\ndifferent.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05706v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Small-World Brain Networks Revisited', ['Danielle S. Bassett', 'Edward T. Bullmore'], u'2016-08-19', u'It is nearly 20 years since the concept of a small-world network was first\nquantitatively defined, by a combination of high clustering and short path\nlength; and about 10 years since this metric of complex network topology began\nto be widely applied to analysis of neuroimaging and other neuroscience data as\npart of the rapid growth of the new field of connectomics. Here we review\nbriefly the foundational concepts of graph theoretical estimation and\ngeneration of small-world networks. We take stock of some of the key\ndevelopments in the field in the past decade and we consider in some detail the\nimplications of recent studies using high-resolution tract-tracing methods to\nmap the anatomical networks of the macaque and the mouse. In doing so, we draw\nattention to the important methodological distinction between topological\nanalysis of binary or unweighted graphs, which have provided a popular but\nsimple approach to brain network analysis in the past, and the topology of\nweighted graphs, which retain more biologically relevant information and are\nmore appropriate to the increasingly sophisticated data on brain connectivity\nemerging from contemporary tract-tracing and other imaging studies. We conclude\nby highlighting some possible future trends in the further development of\nweighted small-worldness as part of a deeper and broader understanding of the\ntopology and the functional value of the strong and weak links between areas of\nmammalian cortex.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05665v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Disambiguating the role of noise correlations when decoding neural\n  populations together', ['Hugo Gabriel Eyherabide'], u'2016-08-19', u'Objective: Integrating information from populations of correlated neurons can\nbecome too complex even for the human brain. Ignoring correlations may simplify\nthe process but also cause an information loss. This loss has been quantified\nusing many methods, one of which has always been deemed exact due to its\nrigorous communication-theoretical foundations. However, we have recently shown\nthat this method can overestimate the loss in real applications. Approach: To\nsolve this problem, we distinguish the communication notion of information used\nby this method from the information notions used by others. Taking their\ndifferences into account, we reassess our previous results and disambiguate\nwhether the overestimation actually indicates a flaw in the method. Other\nhypothetical sources of overestimation are tested by comparing the method with\ndirect computations of communication information loss. Discrepancies are\nresolved within an information-theoretical framework, thereby rigorously\nproving any source of overestimation. Main results: Here we show that the\ncurrently-deemed exact method actually overestimates the communication\ninformation loss. The overestimation occurs when populations transmitting\nindependent information are decoded together, and can reach up to $ 100\\,\\% $\nof the encoded information. The culprit was traced back to unforeseen\nlimitations of its information-theoretical foundations that do not arise when\nstudying traditional reduced codes. Significance: Our results improve the\nconceptual and numerical accuracy of the methods used to assess the role of\ncorrelations in decoding, thereby providing new insight that may potentially\nlead to resolving long-standing debates, simplifying the construction of neural\nprosthetics with tolerable information losses, and reducing the amount of\nresources required to study brain function and information integration.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05501v1', ['Neurons and Cognition', 'Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Haploid-Diploid Algorithms', ['Larry Bull'], u'2016-08-19', u'This short paper uses the recently presented idea that the fundamental\nhaploid-diploid lifecycle of all eukaryote organisms exploits a rudimentary\nform of the Baldwin effect. The general approach presented here differs from\nall previous known work using diploid representations within evolutionary\ncomputation. The role of recombination is also changed from that previously\nconsidered in both natural and artificial evolution under the new theory. Using\nthe NK model of fitness landscapes and the RBNK model of gene regulatory\nnetworks it is here shown that varying landscape ruggedness varies the benefit\nof a haploid-diploid approach in comparison to the traditional haploid\nrepresentation in both cases.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05578v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Rock-paper-scissors played within competing domains in predator-prey\n  games', ['Darka Labavic', 'Hildegard Meyer-Ortmanns'], u'2016-08-19', u'We consider (N,r) games of predation with N species and r < N prey and\npredators, acting in a cyclic way. Further basic reactions include\nreproduction, decay and diffusion over a regular grid, without a hard\nconstraint on the occupation number per site, so in a "bosonic" implementation.\nFor special combinations of N and r and appropriate parameter choices we\nobserve games within games, that is, different coexisting games, depending on\nthe spatial resolution. As concrete and simplest example we analyze the (6,3)\ngame. Once the players segregate from a random initial distribution, domains\nemerge, which effectively play a (2,1)-game on the coarse scale of domain\ndiameters, while agents inside the domains play (3,1) (rock-paper-scissors),\nleading to spiral formation with species chasing each other. As the (2,1)-game\nhas a winner in the end, the coexistence of domains is transient, while agents\ninside the remaining domain coexist, until demographic fluctuations lead to\nextinction of all but one species in the very end. This means that we observe a\ndynamical generation of multiple space and time scales with emerging\nre-organization of players upon segregation, starting from a simple set of\nrules on the smallest scale and changed rules from the coarser perspective.\nThese observations are based on Gillespie simulations. We discuss the\ndeterministic limit derived from a van Kampen expansion. The linear stability\nanalysis predicts the number of forming domains, their composition in terms of\nspecies; it also explains the instability of interfaces between domains, which\ndrives their extinction; spiral patterns are identified as motion along\nheteroclinic cycles. The numerical solutions reproduce the observed patterns of\nthe Gillespie simulations including even extinction events, so that the\nmean-field analysis here is very conclusive, which is due to the specific\nimplementation of rules.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05553v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Associative memory by collective regulation of non-coding RNA', ['J. M. Deutsch'], u'2016-08-19', u'The majority of mammalian genomic transcripts do not directly code for\nproteins and it is currently believed that most of these are not under\nevolutionary constraint. However given the abundance non-coding RNA (ncRNA) and\nits strong affinity for inter-RNA binding, these molecules have the potential\nto regulate proteins in a highly distributed way, similar to artificial neural\nnetworks. We explore this analogy by devising a simple architecture for a\nbiochemical network that can function as an associative memory. We show that\nthe steady state solution for this chemical network has the same structure as\nan associative memory neural network model. By allowing the choice of\nequilibrium constants between different ncRNA species, the concentration of\nunbound ncRNA can be made to follow any pattern and many patterns can be stored\nsimultaneously. The model is studied numerically and within certain parameter\nregimes it functions as predicted. Even if the starting concentration pattern\nis quite different, it is shown to converge to the original pattern most of the\ntime. The network is also robust to mutations in equilibrium constants. This\ncalls into question the criteria for deciding if a sequence is under\nevolutionary constraint.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05494v1', ['Populations and Evolution', 'Molecular Networks', 'Genomics'], []]
