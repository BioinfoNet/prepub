[u'Intrinsically-generated fluctuating activity in excitatory-inhibitory\n  networks', ['Francesca Mastrogiuseppe', 'Srdjan Ostojic'], u'2016-05-13', u'Recurrent networks of non-linear units display a variety of dynamical regimes\ndepending on the structure of their synaptic connectivity. A particularly\nremarkable phenomenon is the appearance of strongly fluctuating, chaotic\nactivity in networks of deterministic, but randomly connected rate units. How\nthis type of intrinsically generated fluctuations appears in more realistic\nnetworks of spiking neurons has been a long standing question. The comparison\nbetween rate and spiking networks has in particular been hampered by the fact\nthat most previous studies on randomly connected rate networks focused on\nhighly simplified models, in which excitation and inhibition were not\nsegregated and firing rates fluctuated symmetrically around zero because of\nbuilt-in symmetries. To ease the comparison between rate and spiking networks,\nwe investigate the dynamical regimes of sparse, randomly-connected rate\nnetworks with segregated excitatory and inhibitory populations, and firing\nrates constrained to be positive. Extending the dynamical mean field theory, we\nshow that network dynamics can be effectively described through two coupled\nequations for the mean activity and the auto-correlation function. As a\nconsequence, we identify a new signature of intrinsically generated\nfluctuations on the level of mean firing rates. We moreover found that\nexcitatory-inhibitory networks develop two different fluctuating regimes: for\nmoderate synaptic coupling, recurrent inhibition is sufficient to stabilize\nfluctuations; for strong coupling, firing rates are stabilized solely by the\nupper bound imposed on activity. These results extend to more general network\narchitectures, and to rate networks receiving noisy inputs mimicking spiking\nactivity. Finally, we show that signatures of those dynamical regimes appear in\nnetworks of integrate-and-fire neurons.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04221v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Distributions of covariances as a window into the operational regime of\n  neuronal networks', ['David Dahmen', 'Markus Diesmann', 'Moritz Helias'], u'2016-05-13', u'Massively parallel recordings of spiking activity in cortical networks show\nthat covariances vary widely across pairs of neurons. Their low average is well\nunderstood, but an explanation for the wide distribution in relation to the\nstatic (quenched) disorder of the connectivity in recurrent random networks was\nso far elusive. We here derive a finite-size mean-field theory that reduces a\ndisordered to a highly symmetric network with fluctuating auxiliary fields. The\nexposed analytical relation between the statistics of connections and the\nstatistics of pairwise covariances shows that both, average and dispersion of\nthe latter, diverge at a critical coupling. At this point, a network of\nnonlinear units transits from regular to chaotic dynamics. Applying these\nresults to recordings from the mammalian brain suggests its operation close to\nthis edge of criticality.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04153v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Structural Pathways Supporting Swift Acquisition of New Visuo-Motor\n  Skills', ['Ari E. Kahn', 'Marcelo G. Mattar', 'Jean M. Vettel', 'Nicholas F. Wymbs', 'Scott T. Grafton', 'Danielle S. Bassett'], u'2016-05-13', u'Human skill learning requires fine-scale coordination of distributed networks\nof brain regions that are directly linked to one another by white matter tracts\nto allow for effective information transmission. Yet how individual differences\nin these anatomical pathways may impact individual differences in learning\nremains far from understood. Here, we test the hypothesis that individual\ndifferences in the organization of structural networks supporting task\nperformance predict individual differences in the rate at which humans learn a\nvisuo-motor skill. Over the course of 6 weeks, twenty-two healthy adult\nsubjects practiced a discrete sequence production task, where they learned a\nsequence of finger movements based on discrete visual cues. We collected\nstructural imaging data during four MRI scanning sessions spaced approximately\ntwo weeks apart, and using deterministic tractography, structural networks were\ngenerated for each participant to identify streamlines that connect cortical\nand sub-cortical brain regions. We observed that increased white matter\nconnectivity linking early visual (but not motor) regions was associated with a\nfaster learning rate. Moreover, we observed that the strength of multi-edge\npaths between motor and visual modules was also correlated with learning rate,\nsupporting the role of polysynaptic connections in successful skill\nacquisition. Our results demonstrate that the combination of diffusion imaging\nand tractography-based connectivity can be used to predict future individual\ndifferences in learning capacity, particularly when combined with methods from\nnetwork science and graph theory.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04033v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Schistosoma mansoni cercariae exploit an elastohydrodynamic coupling to\n  swim efficiently', ['Deepak Krishnamurthy', 'Georgios Katsikis', 'Arjun Bhargava', 'Manu Prakash'], u'2016-05-13', u"The motility of many parasites is critical for the infection process of their\nhost, as exemplified by the transmission cycle of the blood fluke Schistosoma\nmansoni. In their human infectious stage, immature, submillimetre-scale forms\nof the parasite known as cercariae swim in freshwater and infect humans by\npenetrating through the skin. This infection causes Schistosomiasis, a\nparasitic disease that is comparable to malaria in its global socio-economic\nimpact. Given that cercariae do not feed and hence have a finite lifetime of\naround 12 hours, efficient motility is crucial for the parasite's survival and\ntransmission of Schistosomiasis. However, a first-principles understanding of\nhow cercariae swim is lacking. Via a combined experimental, theoretical and\nrobotics based approach, we demonstrate that cercariae propel themselves\nagainst gravity by exploiting a unique elastohydrodynamic coupling. We show\nthat cercariae beat their tail in a periodic fashion while maintaining a fixed\nflexibility near their posterior and anterior ends. The flexibility in these\nregions allows an interaction between the fluid drag and bending resistance: an\nelastohydrodynamic coupling, to naturally break time-reversal symmetry and\nenable locomotion at small length-scales. We present a theoretical model, a\n'T-swimmer', which captures the key swimming phenotype of cercariae. We further\nvalidate our results experimentally through a macro-scale robotic realization\nof the 'T-swimmer', explaining the unique forked-tail geometry of cercariae.\nFinally, we find that cercariae maintain the flexibility at their posterior and\nanterior ends at an optimal regime for efficient swimming, as predicted by our\ntheoretical model. We anticipate that our work sets the ground for linking the\nswimming of S. mansoni cercariae to disease transmission and enables\nexplorations of novel strategies for Schistosomiasis prevention.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04041v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Cell contractility facilitates alignment of cells and tissues to static\n  uniaxial stretch', ['Elisabeth G. Rens', 'Roeland M. H. Merks'], u'2016-05-12', u'During animal development and homeostasis, the structure of tissues,\nincluding muscles, blood vessels and connective tissues adapts to mechanical\nstrains in the extracellular matrix (ECM). These strains originate from the\ndifferential growth of tissues or forces due to muscle contraction or gravity.\nHere we show using a computational model that by amplifying local strain cues,\nactive cell contractility can facilitate and accelerate the reorientation of\nsingle cells to static strains. At the collective cell level, the model\nsimulations show that active cell contractility can facilitate the formation of\nstrings along the orientation of stretch. The computational model is based on a\nhybrid cellular Potts and finite-element simulation framework describing a\nmechanical cell-substrate feedback, where: 1) cells apply forces on the ECM,\nsuch that 2) local strains are generated in the ECM, and 3) cells\npreferentially extend protrusions along the strain orientation. In accordance\nwith experimental observations, simulated cells align and form string-like\nstructures parallel to static uniaxial stretch. Our model simulations predict\nthat the magnitude of the uniaxial stretch and the strength of the contractile\nforces regulate a gradual transition between string-like patterns and vascular\nnetwork-like patterns.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03987v1', ['Tissues and Organs', 'Cell Behavior'], []]
