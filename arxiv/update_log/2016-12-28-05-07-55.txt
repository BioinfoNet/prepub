[u'Unravelling Mg$^{2+}$-RNA binding with atomistic molecular dynamics', ['Richard A. Cunha', 'Giovanni Bussi'], u'2016-12-27', u'Interaction with divalent cations is of paramount importance for RNA structural stability and function. We here report a detailed molecular dynamics study of all the possible binding sites for Mg$^{2+}$ on a RNA duplex, including both direct (inner sphere) and indirect (outer sphere) binding. In order to tackle sampling issues, we develop a modified version of bias-exchange metadynamics which allows us to simultaneously compute affinities with previously unreported statistical accuracy. Results correctly reproduce trends observed in crystallographic databases. Based on this, we simulate a carefully chosen set of models that allows us to quantify the effects of competition with monovalent cations, RNA flexibility, and RNA hybridization. Our simulations reproduce the decrease and increase of Mg$^{2+}$ affinity due to ion competition and hybridization respectively, and predict that RNA flexibility has a site dependent effect. This suggests a non trivial interplay between RNA conformational entropy and divalent cation binding.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08550v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Functional analysis of the N-terminal basic motif of a eukaryotic satellite RNA virus capsid protein in replication and packaging', ['Venkatesh Sivanandam', 'Deborah Mathews', 'Rees Garmann', 'Gonca Erdemci-Tandogan', 'Roya Zandi', 'A. L. N. Rao'], u'2016-12-26', u"Efficient replication and assembly of virus particles are integral to the establishment of infection. In addition to the primary role of the capsid protein (CP) in encapsidating the RNA progeny, experimental evidence on positive sense single-stranded RNA viruses suggests that the CP also regulates RNA synthesis. Here, we demonstrate that replication of Satellite tobacco mosaic virus (STMV) is controlled by the cooperative interaction between STMV CP and the helper virus (HV) Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) replicase. We identified that the STMV CP-HV replicase interaction requires a positively charged residue at the third position (3R) in the N-terminal 13 amino acid (aa) motif. Far-Northwestern blotting showed that STMV CP promotes binding between HV-replicase and STMV RNA. An STMV CP variant having an arginine to alanine substitution at position 3 in the N-terminal 13aa motif abolished replicase-CP binding. The N-terminal 13aa motif of the CP bearing alanine substitutions for positively charged residues located at positions 5, 7, 10 and 11 are defective in packaging full-length STMV, but can package a truncated STMV RNA lacking the 3' terminal 150 nt region. These findings provide insights into the mechanism underlying the regulation of STMV replication and packaging.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08449v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Multiscale persistent functions for biomolecular structure characterization', ['Kelin Xia', 'Zhiming Li', 'Lin Mu'], u'2016-12-26', u'In this paper, we introduce multiscale persistent functions for biomolecular structure characterization. The essential idea is to combine our multiscale rigidity functions with persistent homology analysis, so as to construct a series of multiscale persistent functions, particularly multiscale persistent entropies, for structure characterization. To clarify the fundamental idea of our method, the multiscale persistent entropy model is discussed in great detail. Mathematically, unlike the previous persistent entropy or topological entropy, a special resolution parameter is incorporated into our model. Various scales can be achieved by tuning its value. Physically, our multiscale persistent entropy can be used in conformation entropy evaluation. More specifically, it is found that our method incorporates in it a natural classification scheme. This is achieved through a density filtration of a multiscale rigidity function built from bond and/or dihedral angle distributions. To further validate our model, a systematical comparison with the traditional entropy evaluation model is done. It is found that our model is able to preserve the intrinsic topological features of biomolecular data much better than traditional approaches, particularly for resolutions in the mediate range. Moreover, our method can be successfully used in protein classification. For a test database with around nine hundred proteins, a clear separation between all-alpha and all-beta proteins can be achieved, using only the dihedral and pseudo-bond angle information. Finally, a special protein structure index (PSI) is proposed, for the first time, to describe the "regularity" of protein structures. Essentially, PSI can be used to describe the "regularity" information in any systems.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08311v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Bayesian Nonparametric Models for Synchronous Brain-Computer Interfaces', ['Jaime Fernando Delgado Saa', 'Mujdat Cetin'], u'2016-12-27', u'A brain-computer interface (BCI) is a system that aims for establishing a non-muscular communication path for subjects who had suffer from a neurodegenerative disease. Many BCI systems make use of the phenomena of event-related synchronization and de-synchronization of brain waves as a main feature for classification of different cognitive tasks. However, the temporal dynamics of the electroencephalographic (EEG) signals contain additional information that can be incorporated into the inference engine in order to improve the performance of the BCIs. This information about the dynamics of the signals have been exploited previously in BCIs by means of generative and discriminative methods. In particular, hidden Markov models (HMMs) have been used in previous works. These methods have the disadvantage that the model parameters such as the number of hidden states and the number of Gaussian mixtures need to be fix "a priori". In this work, we propose a Bayesian nonparametric model for brain signal classification that does not require "a priori" selection of the number of hidden states and the number of Gaussian mixtures of a HMM. The results show that the proposed model outperform other methods based on HMM as well as the winner algorithm of the BCI competition IV.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08642v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Analysis of claims that the brain extracellular impedance is high and non-resistive', ['Boris Barbour'], u'2016-12-26', u"Numerous measurements in the brain of the impedance between two extracellular electrodes have shown that it is approximately resistive in the range of biological interest, $<10\\,$kHz, and has a value close to that expected from the conductivity of physiological saline and the extracellular volume fraction in brain tissue. Recent work from the group of Claude B\\'edard and Alain Destexhe has claimed that the impedance of the extracellular space is some three orders of magnitude greater than these values and also displays a $1/\\sqrt{f}$ frequency dependence (above a low-frequency corner frequency). Their measurements were performed between an intracellular electrode and an extracellular electrode. It is argued that they incorrectly extracted the extracellular impedance because of an inaccurate representation of the large, confounding impedance of the neuronal membrane. In conclusion, no compelling evidence has been provided to undermine the well established and physically plausible consensus that the brain extracellular impedance is low and approximately resistive", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08457v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Multi-Region Neural Representation: A novel model for decoding visual stimuli in human brains', ['Muhammad Yousefnezhad', 'Daoqiang Zhang'], u'2016-12-26', u'Multivariate Pattern (MVP) classification holds enormous potential for decoding visual stimuli in the human brain by employing task-based fMRI data sets. There is a wide range of challenges in the MVP techniques, i.e. decreasing noise and sparsity, defining effective regions of interest (ROIs), visualizing results, and the cost of brain studies. In overcoming these challenges, this paper proposes a novel model of neural representation, which can automatically detect the active regions for each visual stimulus and then utilize these anatomical regions for visualizing and analyzing the functional activities. Therefore, this model provides an opportunity for neuroscientists to ask this question: what is the effect of a stimulus on each of the detected regions instead of just study the fluctuation of voxels in the manually selected ROIs. Moreover, our method introduces analyzing snapshots of brain image for decreasing sparsity rather than using the whole of fMRI time series. Further, a new Gaussian smoothing method is proposed for removing noise of voxels in the level of ROIs. The proposed method enables us to combine different fMRI data sets for reducing the cost of brain studies. Experimental studies on 4 visual categories (words, consonants, objects and nonsense photos) confirm that the proposed method achieves superior performance to state-of-the-art methods.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08392v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

E} \\textbf{90}, 022125 (2014). Through a recursive algorithm combined with a random number generator, it is possible to reproduce the number of ancestor for each generation and use it to constraint a maximum number of the following generation. This simulation allows to consider the reproductive preferences of particular species and combine several trees to simulate the population behavior. With this approach it is also possible to describe the simulation algorithm as a theoretical stochastic process.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08368v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'A Generalized Population Dynamics Model of a City and an Algorithm for Engineering Regime Shifts', ['James PL Tan'], u'2016-12-26', u"Measures of wealth and production have been found to scale superlinearly with the population of a city. Therefore, it makes economic sense for humans to congregate together in dense settlements. A recent model of population dynamics showed that population growth can become superexponential due to the superlinear scaling of production with population in a city. Here, we generalize this population dynamics model and demonstrate the existence of multiple stable equilibrium points, showing how population growth can be stymied by a poor economic environment. This occurs when the goods and services produced by the city become less profitable due to a lack of diversification in the city's economy. Then, relying on critical slowing down signals related to the stability of an equilibrium point, we present an algorithm for engineering regime shifts such that a city at a stable equilibrium point may continue to grow again. The generality of the model and the algorithm used here implies that the model and algorithm need not be restricted to urban systems; they are easily applicable to other types of systems where the assumptions used are valid.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08338v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Tensors and algebra give interpretable groups for crosstalk mechanisms in breast cancer', ['Anna Seigal', 'Mariano Beguerisse-Diaz', 'Birgit Schoeberl', 'Mario Niepel', 'Heather A. Harrington'], u'2016-12-24', u'We introduce a tensor-based algebraic clustering method to extract sparse, low-dimensional structure from multidimensional arrays of experimental data. Our methodology is applicable to high dimensional data structures that arise across the sciences. Specifically we introduce a new way to cluster data subject to multi-indexed structural constraints via integer programming. The method can work as a stand-alone clustering tool or in combination with established methods. We implement this approach on a dataset consisting of genetically diverse breast cancer cell lines exposed to a range of signaling molecules, where each experiment is labelled by its combination of cell line and ligand. The data consist of time-course measurements of the immediate-early signaling of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK), and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Protein kinase B (AKT). By respecting the multi-indexed structure of the experimental data, the analysis can be optimized for biological interpretation and therapeutic understanding. We quantify the heterogeneity of breast cancer cell subtypes and systematically explore mechanistic models of MAP Kinase and PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)/AKT crosstalk based on the results of our method.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08116v1', ['Quantitative Methods', 'Molecular Networks'], []]
[u'Period robustness and entrainability under changing nucleotide concentrations in the post-translational Kai circadian clock', ['Joris Paijmans', 'David K Lubensky', 'Pieter Rein ten Wolde'], u'2016-12-25', u'Circadian clocks must be able to entrain to time-varying signals to keep their oscillations in phase with the day-night rhythm. On the other hand, they must also exhibit input compensation: their period must remain about one day in different constant environments. The post-translational oscillator of the Kai system can be entrained by transient or oscillatory changes in the ATP fraction, yet is insensitive to constant changes in this fraction. We study in three different models of this system how these two seemingly conflicting criteria are met: the Van Zon model (Van Zon et al., PNAS, 2007), the Rust model (Phong et al., PNAS, 2013), and our new model (Paijmans et al., arXiv:1612.02715). We find that the new model exhibits the best trade-off between input compensation and entrainability: on the footing of equal phase-response curves, it exhibits the strongest input compensation. Performing stochastic simulations at the level of individual hexamers allows us to identify a new mechanism, which is employed by the new model to achieve input compensation: At lower ATP fraction, the individual hexamers make a shorter cycle in the phosphorylation state space, which compensates for the slower pace at which they traverse the cycle.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08305v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]

There are two competing models for the process of forming the mature HIV-1 core: the disassembly and de novo reassembly model and the non-diffusional displacive model. To study the maturation pathway, we simulate HIV-1 maturation in vitro by digesting immature particles and assembled virus-like particles with recombinant HIV-1 protease and monitor the process with biochemical assays and cryoEM structural analysis in parallel. Processing of Gag in vitro is accurate and efficient and results in both soluble capsid protein and conical or tubular capsid assemblies, seemingly converted from immature Gag particles. Computer simulations further reveal probable assembly pathways of HIV-1 capsid formation. Combining the experimental data and computer simulations, our results suggest a sequential combination of both displacive and disassembly/reassembly processes for HIV-1 maturation.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08444v1', ['Subcellular Processes'], []]
