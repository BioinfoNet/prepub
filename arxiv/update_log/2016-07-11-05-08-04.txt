[u'Modeling mutations in bacteria and human tissues', ['Dario A. Leon'], u'2016-07-07', u"This thesis is aimed at studying mutations, understood as trajectories in the\nDNA configuration space. An evolutive model of mutations in terms of Levy\nflights is proposed. The parameters of the model are estimated by means of data\nfrom the Long-Term Evolution Experiment (LTEE) with {\\it E. Coli} bacteria. The\nresults of simulations on competition of clones, mean fitness, etc are compared\nwith experimental data. We discuss the qualitative analogy found between the\nbacterial mutator phenotype and the cancerous cells. The role of radiation as\nsource of mutations is analyzed. We focus on the case of Radon's decay in the\nlungs in breathing.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02164v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'A Weighted Exact Test for Mutually Exclusive Mutations in Cancer', ['Mark D. M. Leiserson', 'Matthew A. Reyna', 'Benjamin J. Raphael'], u'2016-07-08', u'The somatic mutations in the pathways that drive cancer development tend to\nbe mutually exclusive across tumors, providing a signal for distinguishing\ndriver mutations from a larger number of random passenger mutations. This\nmutual exclusivity signal can be confounded by high and highly variable\nmutation rates across a cohort of samples. Current statistical tests for\nexclusivity that incorporate both per-gene and per-sample mutational\nfrequencies are computationally expensive and have limited precision.\n  We formulate a weighted exact test for assessing the significance of\nmutational exclusivity in an arbitrary number of mutational events. Our test\nconditions on the number of samples with a mutation as well as per-event,\nper-sample mutation probabilities. We provide a recursive formula to compute\n$p$-values for the weighted test exactly as well as a highly accurate and\nefficient saddlepoint approximation of the test. We use our test to approximate\na commonly used permutation test for exclusivity that conditions on per-event,\nper-sample mutation frequencies. However, our test is more efficient and it\nrecovers more significant results than the permutation test. We use our\nWeighted Exclusivity Test (WExT) software to analyze hundreds of colorectal and\nendometrial samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas, which are two cancer types\nthat often have extremely high mutation rates. On both cancer types, the\nweighted test identifies sets of mutually exclusive mutations in cancer genes\nwith fewer false positives than earlier approaches.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02447v1', ['Quantitative Methods', 'Genomics'], []]
[u'Narrow Escape to a structured target and application to viral entry in\n  the nucleus', ['Thibault Lagache', 'David Holcman'], u'2016-07-08', u'In cellular biology, reaching a target before being degraded or trapped is\nubiquitous. An interesting example is given by the virus journey inside the\ncell cytoplasm: in order to replicate, most viruses have to reach the nucleus\nbefore being trapped or degraded. We present here a general approach to\nestimate the probability and the conditional mean first passage time for such a\nviral particle to attain safely the nucleus, covered with many (around two\nthousands) small absorbing pores. Due to this large number of small holes,\nwhich defines the limiting scale, any Brownian simulations are very unstable.\nOur new asymptotic formulas precisely account for this phenomena and allow to\nquantify the cytoplasmic stage of viral infection. We confirm our analysis with\nBrownian simulations.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02479v1', ['Subcellular Processes'], []]
