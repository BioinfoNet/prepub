[u'Improved RNA pseudoknots prediction and classification using a new\n  topological invariant', ['Graziano Vernizzi', 'Henri Orland', 'A. Zee'], u'2016-05-16', u'We propose a new topological characterization of RNA secondary structures\nwith pseudoknots based on two topological invariants. Starting from the classic\narc-representation of RNA secondary structures, we consider a model that\ncouples both I) the topological genus of the graph and II) the number of\ncrossing arcs of the corresponding primitive graph. We add a term proportional\nto these topological invariants to the standard free energy of the RNA\nmolecule, thus obtaining a novel free energy parametrization which takes into\naccount the abundance of topologies of RNA pseudoknots observed in RNA\ndatabases.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04825v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Role of phytochemicals in the chemoprevention of tumors', ['Enrico Catalano'], u'2016-05-15', u'Phytochemicals are plant-derived secondary metabolites, which may exert many\nbiological activities in humans, including anticancer properties. Although\nrecent findings appear to support their role in cancer prevention and\ntreatment, this issue is still controversial. Anti-cancer activity of\nphytochemicals mainly depends on their multi-target mechanism of action,\nincluding antimutagenic, antioxidant and antiproliferative activities.\nFurthermore, they may modulate the host immune response to cancer, reducing\ninflammatory microenvironment and enhancing lymphocyte onco-surveillance. Since\ncarcinogenesis is multi-factorial and involves several signaling pathways,\nmulti-targeted agents as phytochemicals may represent promising anticancer\ncompounds. This narrative review aims to analyze the current literature on\nphytochemicals highlighting their specific targets on carcinogenic molecular\npathways and their chemopreventive role. A full comprehension of their activity\nat molecular and cellular levels will contribute for a better understanding of\nphytochemical clinical efficacy, thus promoting the identification of new\neffective plant-derived therapeutics.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04519v1', ['Biomolecules', 'Tissues and Organs'], []]
[u'RNAiFold2T: Constraint Programming design of thermo-IRES switches', ['Juan Antonio Garcia-Martin', 'Ivan Dotu', 'Javier Fernandez-Chamorro', 'Gloria Lozano', 'Jorge Ramajo', 'Encarnacion Martinez-Salas', 'Peter Clote'], u'2016-05-14', u'Motivation: RNA thermometers (RNATs) are cis-regulatory ele- ments that\nchange secondary structure upon temperature shift. Often involved in the\nregulation of heat shock, cold shock and virulence genes, RNATs constitute an\ninteresting potential resource in synthetic biology, where engineered RNATs\ncould prove to be useful tools in biosensors and conditional gene regulation.\nResults: Solving the 2-temperature inverse folding problem is critical for RNAT\nengineering. Here we introduce RNAiFold2T, the ?rst Constraint Programming (CP)\nand Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) algorithms to solve this problem.\nBenchmarking tests of RNAiFold2T against existent programs (adaptive walk and\ngenetic algorithm) inverse folding show that our software generates two orders\nof magnitude more solutions, thus allow- ing ample exploration of the space of\nsolutions. Subsequently, solutions can be prioritized by computing various\nmeasures, including probability of target structure in the ensemble, melting\ntemperature, etc. Using this strategy, we rationally designed two thermosensor\ninternal ribosome entry site (thermo-IRES) elements, whose normalized\ncap-independent transla- tion e?ciency is approximately 50% greater at 42?C\nthan 30?C, when tested in reticulocyte lysates. Translation e?ciency is lower\nthan that of the wild-type IRES element, which on the other hand is fully\nresistant to temperature shift-up. This appears to be the ?rst purely\ncomputational design of functional RNA thermoswitches, and certainly the ?rst\npurely computational design of functional thermo-IRES elements. Availability:\nRNAiFold2T is publicly available as as part of the new re- lease RNAiFold3.0 at\nhttps://github.com/clotelab/RNAiFold and http:\n//bioinformatics.bc.edu/clotelab/RNAiFold, which latter has a web server as\nwell.

[u'Identification and Analysis of Transition and Metastable Markov States', ['Linda Martini', 'Adam Kells', 'Gerhard Hummer', 'Nicolae-Viorel Buchete', 'Edina Rosta'], u'2016-05-13', u'We present a new method that enables the identification and analysis of both\ntransition and metastable conformational states from atomistic or\ncoarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories. Our algorithm is presented\nand studied by using both analytical and actual examples from MD simulations of\nthe helix-forming peptide Ala5, and of a larger system, the epidermal growth\nfactor receptor (EGFR) protein. In all cases, our method identifies\nautomatically the corresponding transition states and metastable conformations\nin an optimal way, with the input of a set of relevant coordinates, by\ncapturing accurately the intrinsic slowest relaxation rate. Our approach\nprovides a general and easy to implement analysis method that provides unique\ninsight into the molecular mechanism and the rare but crucial rate limiting\nconformational pathways occurring in complex dynamical systems such as\nmolecular trajectories.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04328v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Pairwise maximum-entropy models and their Glauber dynamics: bimodality,\n  bistability, non-ergodicity problems, and their elimination via inhibition', ['Vahid Rostami', 'PierGianLuca Porta Mana', 'Moritz Helias'], u'2016-05-16', u'Pairwise maximum-entropy models have been used in recent neuroscientific\nliterature to predict the activity of neuronal populations, given only the\ntime-averaged correlations of the neuron activities. This paper provides\nevidence that the pairwise model, applied to experimental recordings, predicts\na bimodal distribution for the population-averaged activity, and for some\npopulation sizes the second mode peaks at high activities, with 90% of the\nneuron population active within time-windows of few milliseconds. This\nbimodality has several undesirable consequences: 1. The presence of two modes\nis unrealistic in view of observed neuronal activity. 2. The prediction of a\nhigh-activity mode is unrealistic on neurobiological grounds. 3. Boltzmann\nlearning becomes non-ergodic, hence the pairwise model found by this method is\nnot the maximum entropy distribution; similarly, solving the inverse problem by\ncommon variants of mean-field approximations has the same problem. 4. The\nGlauber dynamics associated with the model is either unrealistically bistable,\nor does not reflect the distribution of the pairwise model. This bimodality is\nfirst demonstrated for an experimental dataset comprising 159 neuron activities\nrecorded from the motor cortex of macaque monkey. Using a reduced\nmaximum-entropy model, evidence is then provided that this bimodality affects\ntypical neural recordings of population sizes of a couple of hundreds or more\nneurons. As a way to eliminate the bimodality and its ensuing problems, a\nmodified pairwise model is presented, which -- most important -- has an\nassociated pairwise Glauber dynamics. This model avoids bimodality thanks to a\nminimal asymmetric inhibition. It can be interpreted as a\nminimum-relative-entropy model with a particular prior, or as a maximum-entropy\nmodel with an additional constraint.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04740v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Advantages of EEG phase patterns for the detection of gait intention in\n  healthy and stroke subjects', ['Andreea Ioana Sburlea', 'Luis Montesano', 'Javier Minguez'], u'2016-05-15', u'One use of EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) in rehabilitation is\nthe detection of movement intention. In this paper we investigate for the first\ntime the instantaneous phase of movement related cortical potential (MRCP) and\nits application to the detection of gait intention. We demonstrate the utility\nof MRCP phase in two independent datasets, in which 10 healthy subjects and 9\nchronic stroke patients executed a self-initiated gait task in three sessions.\nPhase features were compared to more conventional amplitude and power features.\nThe neurophysiology analysis showed that phase features have higher\nsignal-to-noise ratio than the other features. Also, BCI detectors of gait\nintention based on phase, amplitude, and their combination were evaluated under\nthree conditions: session specific calibration, intersession transfer, and\nintersubject transfer. Results show that the phase based detector is the most\naccurate for session specific calibration (movement intention was correctly\ndetected in 66.5% of trials in healthy subjects, and in 63.3% in stroke\npatients). However, in intersession and intersubject transfer, the detector\nthat combines amplitude and phase features is the most accurate one and the\nonly that retains its accuracy (62.5% in healthy subjects and 59% in stroke\npatients) w.r.t. session specific calibration. Thus, MRCP phase features\nimprove the detection of gait intention and could be used in practice to remove\ntime-consuming BCI recalibration.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04533v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Diversity of emergent dynamics in competitive threshold-linear networks:\n  a preliminary report', ['Katherine Morrison', 'Anda Degeratu', 'Vladimir Itskov', 'Carina Curto'], u'2016-05-14', u'Threshold-linear networks consist of simple units interacting in the presence\nof a threshold nonlinearity. Competitive threshold-linear networks have long\nbeen known to exhibit multistability, where the activity of the network settles\ninto one of potentially many steady states. In this work, we find conditions\nthat guarantee the absence of steady states, while maintaining bounded\nactivity. These conditions lead us to define a combinatorial family of\ncompetitive threshold-linear networks, parametrized by a simple directed graph.\nBy exploring this family, we discover that threshold-linear networks are\ncapable of displaying a surprisingly rich variety of nonlinear dynamics,\nincluding limit cycles, quasiperiodic attractors, and chaos. In particular,\nseveral types of nonlinear behaviors can co-exist in the same network. Our\nmathematical results also enable us to engineer networks with multiple dynamic\npatterns. Taken together, these theoretical and computational findings suggest\nthat threshold-linear networks may be a valuable tool for understanding the\nrelationship between network connectivity and emergent dynamics.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04463v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

[u'A Bayesian approach to parameter identification with an application to\n  Turing systems', ['Eduard Campillo-Funollet', 'Chandrasekhar Venkataraman', 'Anotida Madzvamuse'], u'2016-05-16', u'We present a Bayesian methodology for infinite as well as finite dimensional\nparameter identification for partial differential equation models. The Bayesian\nframework provides a rigorous mathematical framework for incorporating prior\nknowledge on uncertainty in the observations and the parameters themselves,\nresulting in an approximation of the full probability distribution for the\nparameters, given the data. Although the numerical approximation of the full\nprobability distribution is computationally expensive, parallelised algorithms\ncan make many practically relevant problems computationally feasible. The\nprobability distribution not only provides estimates for the values of the\nparameters, but also provides information about the inferability of parameters\nand the sensitivity of the model. This information is crucial when a\nmathematical model is used to study the outcome of real-world experiments.\nKeeping in mind the applicability of our approach to tackle real-world\npractical problems with data from experiments, in this initial proof of concept\nwork, we apply this theoretical and computational framework to parameter\nidentification for a well studied semilinear reaction-diffusion system with\nactivator-depleted reaction kinetics, posed on evolving and stationary domains.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04718v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Identifying and removing the cell-cycle effect from single-cell\n  RNA-Sequencing data', ['Martin Barron', 'Jun Li'], u'2016-05-15', u'Single-cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNA-Seq) is a revolutionary technique for\ndiscovering and describing cell types in heterogeneous tissues, yet its\nmeasurement of expression often suffers from large systematic bias. A major\nsource of this bias is the cell cycle, which introduces large within-cell-type\nheterogeneity that can obscure the differences in expression between cell\ntypes. The current method for removing the cell-cycle effect is unable to\neffectively identify this effect and has a high risk of removing other\nbiological components of interest, compromising downstream analysis. We present\nccRemover, a new method that reliably identifies the cell-cycle effect and\nremoves it. ccRemover preserves other biological signals of interest in the\ndata and thus can serve as an important pre-processing step for many scRNA-Seq\ndata analyses. The effectiveness of ccRemover is demonstrated using simulation\ndata and three real scRNA-Seq datasets, where it boosts the performance of\nexisting clustering algorithms in distinguishing between cell types.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04492v1', ['Quantitative Methods', 'Genomics'], []]
[u'Forman curvature for directed networks', ['R. P. Sreejith', 'Jurgen Jost', 'Emil Saucan', 'Areejit Samal'], u'2016-05-16', u"A goal in network science is the geometrical characterization of complex\nnetworks. In this direction, we have recently introduced the Forman's\ndiscretization of Ricci curvature to the realm of undirected networks.\nInvestigation of Forman curvature in diverse model and real-world undirected\nnetworks revealed that this measure captures several aspects of the\norganization of complex undirected networks. However, many important real-world\nnetworks are inherently directed in nature, and the Forman curvature for\nundirected networks is unsuitable for analysis of such directed networks.\nHence, we here extend the Forman curvature for undirected networks to the case\nof directed networks. The simple mathematical formula for the Forman curvature\nin directed networks elegantly incorporates node weights, edge weights and edge\ndirection. By applying the Forman curvature for directed networks to a variety\nof model and real-world directed networks, we show that the measure can be used\nto characterize the structure of complex directed networks. Furthermore, our\nresults also hold in real directed networks which are weighted or spatial in\nnature. These results in combination with our previous results suggest that the\nForman curvature can be readily employed to study the organization of both\ndirected and undirected complex networks.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04662v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
