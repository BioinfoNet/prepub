[u'Relaxing the Hypotheses of Symmetry and Time-Reversibility in Genome\n  Evolutionary Models', ['Jacques M. Bahi', 'Christophe Guyeux', 'Antoine Perasso'], u'2016-08-22', u'Various genome evolutionary models have been proposed these last decades to\npredict the evolution of a DNA sequence over time, essentially described using\na mutation matrix. By essence, all of these models relate the evolution of DNA\nsequences to the computation of the successive powers of the mutation matrix.\nTo make this computation possible, hypotheses are assumed for the matrix, such\nas symmetry and time-reversibility, which are not compatible with mutation\nrates that have been recently obtained experimentally on genes ura3 and can1 of\nthe Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this work, authors investigate\nsystematically the possibility to relax either the symmetry or the\ntime-reversibility hypothesis of the mutation matrix, by investigating all the\npossible matrices of size 2*2 and 3*3. As an application example, the\nexperimental study on the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been used in order\nto deduce a simple mutation matrix, and to compute the future evolution of the\nrate purine/pyrimidine for $ura3$ on the one hand, and of the particular\nbehavior of cytosines and thymines compared to purines on the other hand.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06107v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Protein Folding in the 2D Hydrophobic-Hydrophilic (HP) Square Lattice\n  Model is Chaotic', ['Jacques M. Bahi', 'Nathalie Cote', 'Christophe Guyeux', 'Michel Salomon'], u'2016-08-20', u'Among the unsolved problems in computational biology, protein folding is one\nof the most interesting challenges. To study this folding, tools like neural\nnetworks and genetic algorithms have received a lot of attention, mainly due to\nthe NP-completeness of the folding process. The background idea that has given\nrise to the use of these algorithms is obviously that the folding process is\npredictable. However, this important assumption is disputable as chaotic\nproperties of such a process have been recently highlighted. In this paper,\nwhich is an extension of a former work accepted to the 2011 International Joint\nConference on Neural Networks (IJCNN11), the topological behavior of a\nwell-known dynamical system used for protein folding prediction is evaluated.\nIt is mathematically established that the folding dynamics in the 2D\nhydrophobic-hydrophilic (HP) square lattice model, simply called "the 2D model"\nin this document, is indeed a chaotic dynamical system as defined by Devaney.\nFurthermore, the chaotic behavior of this model is qualitatively and\nquantitatively deepened, by studying other mathematical properties of disorder,\nnamely: the indecomposability, instability, strong transitivity, and constants\nof expansivity and sensitivity. Some consequences for both biological paradigms\nand structure prediction using this model are then discussed. In particular, it\nis shown that some neural networks seems to be unable to predict the evolution\nof this model with accuracy, due to its complex behavior.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05855v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Reconstructing Neural Parameters and Synapses of arbitrary\n  interconnected Neurons from their Simulated Spiking Activity', ['J. Fischer', 'P. Manoonpong', 'S. Lackner'], u'2016-08-22', u'To understand the behavior of a neural circuit it is a presupposition that we\nhave a model of the dynamical system describing this circuit. This model is\ndetermined by several parameters, including not only the synaptic weights, but\nalso the parameters of each neuron. Existing works mainly concentrate on either\nthe synaptic weights or the neural parameters. In this paper we present an\nalgorithm to reconstruct all parameters including the synaptic weights of a\nspiking neuron model. The model based on works of Eugene M. Izhikevich\n(Izhikevich 2007) consists of two differential equations and covers different\ntypes of cortical neurons. It combines the dynamical properties of\nHodgkin-Huxley-type dynamics with a high computational efficiency. The\npresented algorithm uses the recordings of the corresponding membrane\npotentials of the model for the reconstruction and consists of two main\ncomponents. The first component is a rank based Genetic Algorithm (GA) which is\nused to find the neural parameters of the model. The second one is a Least Mean\nSquares approach which computes the synaptic weights of all interconnected\nneurons by minimizing the squared error between the calculated and the measured\nmembrane potentials for each time step. In preparation for the reconstruction\nof the neural parameters and of the synaptic weights from real measured\nmembrane potentials, promising results based on simulated data generated with a\nrandomly parametrized Izhikevich model are presented. The reconstruction does\nnot only converge to a global minimum of neural parameters, but also\napproximates the synaptic weights with high precision.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06132v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Reaction time impairments in decision-making networks as a diagnostic\n  marker for traumatic brain injuries and neurodegenerative diseases', ['Pedro D. Maia', 'J.

Among\nother things, the FAS have a significant impact on spike-train encodings that\npropagate through the affected neurons, leading to compromised signal\nprocessing on a neuronal network level. This work merges, for the first time,\nthree fields of study: (i) signal processing in excitatory-inhibitory (EI)\nnetworks of neurons via population codes, (ii) decision-making theory driven by\nthe production of evidence from stimulus, and (iii) compromised spike-train\npropagation through FAS. As such, we demonstrate a mathematical architecture\ncapable of characterizing compromised decision-making driven by cellular\nmechanisms. The computational model also leads to several novel predictions and\ndiagnostics for understanding injury level and cognitive deficits, including a\nkey finding that decision-making reaction times, rather than accuracy, are\nindicative of network level damage. The results have a number of translational\nimplications, including that the level of network damage can be characterized\nby the reaction times in simple cognitive and motor tests.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05778v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

While recent studies have reported a phase transition in the\nparameter space of maximum entropy models describing the neural probability\ndistributions, the interpretation of these findings has been debated. Here, we\nsuggest that this phase transition may be evidence of a `structured',\ncollective state in the neural population. We show that this phase transition\nis robust to changes in stimulus ensemble and adaptive state. We find that the\npattern of pairwise correlations between neurons has a strength that is well\nwithin the strongly correlated regime and does not require fine tuning,\nsuggesting that this state is generic for populations of 100+ neurons. We find\na clear correspondence between the emergence of a phase transition, and the\nemergence of attractor-like structure in the inferred energy landscape. A\ncollective state in the neural population, in which neural activity patterns\nnaturally form clusters, provides a consistent interpretation for our results.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05751v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

The Zika virus has been known\nsince 1947 and invaded South America in 2013. It can be transmitted not only by\n(mosquito) vectors but also directly through sexual contact. Zika has developed\ninto a serious global health problem because, while most cases are asymptomatic\nor very light, babies born to Zika - infected mothers may develop microcephaly\nand other very serious birth defects.\n  We formulate and analyze two epidemic models for vector-transmitted diseases,\none appropriate for dengue and chikungunya fever outbreaks and one that\nincludes direct transmission appropriate for Zika virus outbreaks. This is\nespecially important because the Zika virus is the first example of a disease\nthat can be spread both indirectly through a vector and directly (through\nsexual contact). In both cases, we obtain expressions for the basic\nreproduction number and show how to use the initial exponential growth rate to\nestimate the basic reproduction number. However, for the model that includes\ndirect transmission some additional data would be needed to identify the\nfraction of cases transmitted directly. Data for the 2015 Zika virus outbreak\nin Barranquilla, Colombia has been used to fit parameters to the model\ndeveloped here and to estimate the basic reproduction number.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06242v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

Using the daily\nair-traffic transportation data we perform numerical experiments to compare the\ninfection arrival time with this alternative metric that is obtained by\naccounting for multiple walks instead of only the most probable path. The\ncomparison with direct simulations of arrival times reveals a higher\ncorrelation compared to the shortest path approach used previously.

[u'Developing Ecospheres on Transiently Habitable Planets: The Genesis\n  Project', ['Claudius Gros'], u'2016-08-22', u"It is often presumed, that life evolves relatively fast on planets with\nclement conditions, at least in its basic forms, and that extended periods of\nhabitability are subsequently needed for the evolution of higher life forms.\nMany planets are however expected to be only transiently habitable. On a large\nset of otherwise suitable planets life will therefore just not have the time to\ndevelop on its own to a complexity level as it did arise on earth with the\ncambrian explosion. The equivalent of a cambrian explosion may however have the\nchance to unfold on transiently habitable planets if it would be possible to\nfast forward evolution by 3-4 billion years (with respect to terrestrial\ntimescales). We argue here, that this is indeed possible when seeding the\ncandidate planet with the microbial lifeforms, bacteria and unicellular\neukaryotes alike, characterizing earth before the cambrian explosion. An\ninterstellar mission of this kind, denoted the `Genesis project', could be\ncarried out by a relatively low-cost robotic microcraft equipped with a\non-board gene laboratory for the in situ synthesis of the microbes.\n  We review here our current understanding of the processes determining the\ntimescales shaping the geo-evolution of an earth-like planet, the prospect of\nfinding Genesis candidate planets and selected issues regarding the mission\nlayout.

Cell fate\nspecification is coordinated via Notch's interaction with the canonical Wnt\npathway. Here, we propose a new mathematical model of the Notch and Wnt\npathways, in which the Hes1 promoter acts as a hub for pathway crosstalk.\nComputational simulations of the model can assist in understanding how healthy\nintestinal tissue is maintained, and predict the likely consequences of\nbiochemical knockouts upon cell fate selection processes. Chemical reaction\nnetwork theory (CRNT) is a powerful, generalised framework which assesses the\ncapacity of our model for monostability or multistability, by analysing\nproperties of the underlying network structure without recourse to specific\nparameter values or functional forms for reaction rates. CRNT highlights the\nrole of beta-catenin in stabilising the Notch pathway and damping oscillations,\ndemonstrating that Wnt-mediated actions on the Hes1 promoter can induce\ndynamical transitions in the Notch system, from multistability to\nmonostability. Time-dependent model simulations of cell pairs reveal the\nstabilising influence of Wnt upon the Notch pathway, in which beta-catenin- and\nDsh-mediated action on the Hes1 promoter are key in shaping the subcellular\ndynamics.
