[u'A Polymer Model with Epigenetic Recolouring Reveals a Pathway for the de\n  novo Establishment and 3D Organisation of Chromatin Domains', ['Davide Michieletto', 'Enzo Orlandini', 'Davide Marenduzzo'], u'2016-06-15', u'One of the most important problems in development is how epigenetic domains\ncan be first established, and then maintained, within cells. To address this\nquestion, we propose a framework which couples 3D chromatin folding dynamics,\nto a "recolouring" process modelling the writing of epigenetic marks. Because\nmany intra-chromatin interactions are mediated by bridging proteins, we\nconsider a "two-state" model with self-attractive interactions between two\nepigenetic marks which are alike (either active or inactive). This model\ndisplays a first-order-like transition between a swollen, epigenetically\ndisordered, phase, and a compact, epigenetically coherent, chromatin globule.\nIf the self-attraction strength exceeds a threshold, the chromatin dynamics\nbecomes glassy, and the corresponding interaction network freezes. By modifying\nthe epigenetic read-write process according to more biologically-inspired\nassumptions, our polymer model with recolouring recapitulates the\nultrasensitive response of epigenetic switches to perturbations, and accounts\nfor multi-domain conformations, strikingly similar to the\ntopologically-associating-domains observed in eukaryotic chromosomes.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04653v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'On the optimality of grid cells', ['Christos H. Papadimitriou'], u'2016-06-15', u'Grid cells, discovered more than a decade ago [5], are neurons in the brain\nof mammals that fire when the animal is located near certain specific points in\nits familiar terrain. Intriguingly, these points form, for a single cell, a\ntwo-dimensional triangular grid, not unlike our Figure 3. Grid cells are widely\nbelieved to be involved in path integration, that is, the maintenance of a\nlocation state through the summation of small displacements. We provide\ntheoretical evidence for this assertion by showing that cells with grid-like\ntuning curves are indeed well adapted for the path integration task. In\nparticular we prove that, in one dimension under Gaussian noise, the\nsensitivity of measuring small displacements is maximized by a population of\nneurons whose tuning curves are near-sinusoids -- that is to say, with peaks\nforming a one-dimensional grid. We also show that effective computation of the\ndisplacement is possible through a second population of cells whose sinusoid\ntuning curves are in phase difference from the first. In two dimensions, under\nadditional assumptions it can be shown that measurement sensitivity is\noptimized by the product of two sinusoids, again yielding a grid-like pattern.\nWe discuss the connection of our results to the triangular grid pattern\nobserved in animals.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04876v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Characterization of the Community Structure of Large Scale Functional\n  Brain Networks During Ketamine-Medetomidine Anesthetic Induction', ['Eduardo C. Padovani'], u'2016-06-15', u'One of the central questions in neuroscience is to understand the way\ncommunication is organized in the brain, trying to comprehend how cognitive\ncapacities or physiological states of the organism are potentially related to\nbrain activities involving interactions of several brain areas. One important\ncharacteristic of the functional brain networks is that they are modularly\nstructured, being this modular architecture regarded to account for a series of\nproperties and functional dynamics. In the neurobiological context, communities\nmay indicate brain regions that are involved in one same activity, representing\nneural segregated processes. Several studies have demonstrated the modular\ncharacter of organization of brain activities. However, empirical evidences\nregarding to its dynamics and relation to different levels of consciousness\nhave not been reported yet. Within this context, this research sought to\ncharacterize the community structure of functional brain networks during an\nanesthetic induction process. The experiment was based on intra-cranial\nrecordings of neural activities of an old world macaque of the species Macaca\nfuscata during a Ketamine-Medetomidine anesthetic induction process. Networks\nwere serially estimated in time intervals of five seconds. Changes were\nobserved within about one and a half minutes after the administration of the\nanesthetics, revealing the occurrence of a transition on the community\nstructure. The awake state was characterized by the presence of large clusters\ninvolving frontal and parietal regions, while the anesthetized state by the\npresence of communities in the primary visual and motor cortices, being the\nareas of the secondary associative cortex most affected. The results report the\ninfluence of general anesthesia on the structure of functional clusters,\ncontributing for understanding some new aspects of neural correlates of\nconsciousness.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04719v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Spatio-temporal convolutional neural networks explain human neural\n  representations of action recognition', ['Andrea Tacchetti', 'Leyla Isik', 'Tomaso Poggio'], u'2016-06-15', u'Recognizing the actions of others from complex visual scenes is an essential\ntask for humans. Here we investigate the computational mechanisms that support\naction recognition in the human visual system. We use a novel dataset of\nwell-controlled naturalistic videos of five actions performed by five actors at\nfive viewpoint and extend a class of biologically inspired hierarchical\ncomputational models of object recognition to recognize actions from videos. We\nexplore a number of variations within the class of convolutional neural\nnetworks and assess classification accuracy on a viewpoint invariant action\nrecognition task as well as a correlation measure with magnetoencephalography\n(MEG) human brain recordings acquired using the same stimuli. We show that\nfeed-forward spatio-temporal convolutional neural networks solve the task of\ninvariant action recognition and account for the majority of the explainable\nvariance in the neural data. Furthermore, we show that model features that\nimprove performance on viewpoint invariant action recognition lead to a model\nrepresentation that better matches the representation encoded by neural data.\nThese results advance the idea that robustness to complex transformations, such\nas 3D viewpoint invariance, is a specific goal of visual processing in the\nhuman brain.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04698v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

Yet, little is known whether women are expected to be more\naltruist than men. Here we elicit third-parties' beliefs about dictators'\ndonations conditional on knowing the gender of the dictator.

[u'Periodic solutions in an SIRWS model with immune boosting and\n  cross-immunity', ['Tiffany Leung', 'Barry D. Hughes', 'Federico Frascoli', 'James M. McCaw'], u'2016-06-15', u'Incidence of whooping cough, an infection caused by Bordetella pertussis and\nBordetella parapertussis, has been on the rise since the 1980s in many\ncountries. Immunological interactions, such as immune boosting and\ncross-immunity between pathogens, have been hypothesised to be important\ndrivers of epidemiological dynamics. We present a two-pathogen model of\ntransmission which examines how immune boosting and cross-immunity can\ninfluence the timing and severity of epidemics. We use a combination of\nnumerical simulations and bifurcation techniques to study the dynamical\nproperties of the system, particularly the conditions under which stable\nperiodic solutions are present. We derive analytic expressions for the steady\nstate of the single-pathogen model, and give a condition for the presence of\nperiodic solutions. A key result from our two-pathogen model is that, while\nstudies have shown that immune boosting at relatively strong levels can\nindependently generate periodic solutions, cross-immunity allows for the\npresence of periodic solutions even when the level of immune boosting is weak.\nAsymmetric cross-immunity can produce striking increases in the incidence and\nperiod. Our study underscores the importance of developing a better\nunderstanding of the immunological interactions between pathogens in order to\nimprove model-based interpretations of epidemiological data.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04600v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Giant amplification of noise in fluctuation-induced pattern formation', ['Tommaso Biancalani', 'Farshid Jafarpour', 'Nigel Goldenfeld'], u'2016-06-12', u'The amplitude of fluctuation-induced patterns might be expected to be\nproportional to the strength of the driving noise, suggesting that such\npatterns would be difficult to observe in nature. Here, we show that a large\nclass of spatially-extended dynamical systems driven by intrinsic noise can\nexhibit giant amplification, yielding patterns whose amplitude is comparable to\nthat of deterministic Turing instabilities. The giant amplification results\nfrom the interplay between noise and non-orthogonal eigenvectors of the linear\nstability matrix, yielding transients that grow with time, and which, when\ndriven by the ever-present intrinsic noise, lead to persistent large amplitude\npatterns. This mechanism provides a robust basis for fluctuation-induced\nbiological pattern formation based on the Turing mechanism, without requiring\nfine tuning of diffusion constants.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04916v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Effect of NaCl on Pseudomonas biofilm viscosity by continuous,\n  non-intrusive microfluidic-based approach', ['Francois Paquet-Mercier', 'Mazeyar Parvinzadeh Gashti', 'Julien Bellavance', 'Seyed Mohammad Taghavi', 'Jesse Greener'], u'2016-06-15', u'A method combining video imaging in parallel microchannels with a\nsemi-empirical mathematical model provides non-intrusive, high-throughput\nmeasurements of time-varying biofilm viscosity. The approach is demonstrated\nfor early growth Pseudomonas sp. biofilms exposed to constant flow streams of\nnutrient solutions with different ionic strengths. The ability to measure\nviscosities at early growth stages, without inducing a shear-thickening\nresponse, enabled measurements that are among the lowest reported to date. In\naddition, good time resolution enabled the detection of a rapid thickening\nphase, which occurred at different times after the exponential growth phase\nfinished, depending on the ionic strength. The technique opens the way for a\ncombinatorial approach to beter understand the complex dynamical response of\nbiofilm mechanical properties under well-controlled physical, chemical and\nbiological growth conditions and time-limited perturbations.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04875v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
