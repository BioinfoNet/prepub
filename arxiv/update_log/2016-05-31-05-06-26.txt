[u'Highly flexible protein-peptide docking using CABS-dock', ['Maciej Pawel Ciemny', 'Mateusz Kurcinski', 'Konrad Jakub Kozak', 'Andrzej Kolinski', 'Sebastian Kmiecik'], u'2016-05-30', u'Protein-peptide molecular docking is a difficult modeling problem. It is even\nmore challenging when significant conformational changes that may occur during\nthe binding process need to be predicted. In this chapter, we demonstrate the\ncapabilities and features of the CABS-dock server for flexible protein-peptide\ndocking. CABS-dock allows highly efficient modeling of full peptide flexibility\nand significant flexibility of a protein receptor. During CABS-dock docking,\nthe peptide folding and binding process is explicitly simulated and no\ninformation about the peptide binding site or its structure, is used. This\nchapter presents a successful CABS-dock use for docking a potentially\ntherapeutic peptide to a protein target. Moreover, simulation contact maps, a\nnew CABS-dock feature, are described and applied to the docking test case.\nFinally, a tutorial for running CABS-dock from the command line or command line\nscripts is provided.

[u'Flexible protein-peptide docking using CABS-dock with knowledge about\n  the binding site', ['Mateusz Kurcinski', 'Maciej Pawel Ciemny', 'Maciej Blaszczyk', 'Andrzej Kolinski', 'Sebastian Kmiecik'], u'2016-05-30', u'Despite considerable efforts, structural prediction of protein-peptide\ncomplexes is still a very challenging task, mainly due to two reasons: high\nflexibility of the peptides and transient character of their interactions with\nproteins. Recently we have developed an automated web server CABS-dock\n(http://biocomp.chem.uw.edu.pl/CABSdock), which conducts flexible\nprotein-peptide docking without any knowledge about the binding site. Our\nmethod allows for full flexibility of the peptide, whereas the flexibility of\nthe receptor is restricted to near native conformations considering the main\nchain, and full flexibility of the side chains. Performance of the CABS-dock\nserver was thoroughly tested on a benchmark of 171 test cases, both bound and\nunbound. Evaluation of the obtained results showed overall good performance of\nthe method, especially that no information of the binding site was used. From\nunsuccessful experiments we learned that the accuracy of docking might be\nsignificantly improved, if only little information of the binding site was\nconsidered. In fact, in real-life applications user typically has access to\nsome data indicating the location and/or structure of the binding site. In the\ncurrent work, we test and demonstrate the performance of the CABS-dock server\nwith two new features. The first one allows to utilize the knowledge about\nreceptor residue(s) constituting the binding site, and the second one allows to\nenforce the desired secondary structure on the peptide structure. Based on the\ngiven example, we observe significant improvement of the docking accuracy in\ncomparison to the default CABS-dock mode.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09269v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Towards protein-protein docking with significant structural changes\n  using CABS-dock', ['Maciej Pawel Ciemny', 'Mateusz Kurcinski', 'Andrzej Kolinski', 'Sebastian Kmiecik'], u'2016-05-30', u"The protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are crucial for understanding the\nmajority of cellular processes. PPIs play important role in gene transcription\nregulation, cellular signaling, molecular basis of immune response and more.\nMoreover, a disruption of hese mechanisms is frequently postulated as a\npossible cause of diseases such as Alzheimer's or cancer. For many of\nbiologically relevant cases the structure of protein-protein complexes remain\nunknown. Therefore computational techniques, including molecular docking, have\nbecome a valuable part of drug discovery pipelines. Unfortunately, none of the\nwidely used protein-protein docking tools is free from serious limitations.\nTypically, in docking simulations the protein flexibility is either completely\nneglected or very limited. Additionally, some knowledge of the approximate\nlocation and/or the shape of the active site is also required. Such limitations\narise mostly from the enormous number of degrees of freedom of protein-protein\nsystems. In this paper, an efficient computational method for protein-protein\ndocking is proposed and initially tested on a single docking case. The proposed\nmethod is based on a two-step procedure. In the first step, CABS-dock web\nserver for protein-peptide docking is used to dock a peptide, which is the\nappropriate protein fragment responsible for the protein-protein interaction,\nto the other protein partner. During peptide docking, no knowledge about the\nbinding site, nor the peptide structure, is used and the peptide is allowed to\nbe fully flexible. In the second step, the docked peptide is used in the\nstructural adjustment of protein complex partners. The proposed method allowed\nus to obtain a high accuracy model, therefore it provides a promising framework\nfor further advances.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09266v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]

For example, in neuroscience, bursting is believed to play a key role\nin the way information is transferred in the nervous system. In this work, we\npropose a model that, appropriately tuned, can display several types of\nbursting behaviors. The model contains two subsystems acting at different\ntimescales. For the fast subsystem we use the planar unfolding of a high\ncodimension singularity. In its bifurcation diagram, we locate paths that\nunderly the right sequence of bifurcations necessary for bursting. The slow\nsubsystem steers the fast one back and forth along these paths leading to\nbursting behavior. The model is able to produce almost all the classes of\nbursting predicted for systems with a planar fast subsystems. Transitions\nbetween classes can be obtained through an ultra-slow modulation of the model's\nparameters. A detailed exploration of the parameter space allows predicting\npossible transitions.

Recently\nits been shown that stable network hub structure is governed by a phase\ntransition at exponents (>2.0) causing a dramatic change in network structure\nincluding a loss of global connectivity, an increasing minimum dominating node\nset, and a shift towards increasing connectivity growth compared to node\ngrowth. Is this SFN shift identifiable in atypical brain activity? The Pareto\nDistribution (P(D)~D^-\\b{eta}) on the hub Degree (D) is a signature of\nscale-free networks.

Nathan Kutz', 'Eric Shea-Brown'], u'2016-05-29', u'How does the connectivity of a network system combine with the behavior of\nits individual components to determine its collective function? We approach\nthis question by relating the internal network feedback to the statistical\nprevalence of connectivity motifs, a set of surprisingly simple and local\nstatistics on the network topology. The resulting motif description provides a\nreduced order model of the network input-output dynamics and it relates the\noverall network function to feedback control theory. For example, this new\nformulation dramatically simplifies the classic Erdos-Renyi graph, reducing the\noverall graph behavior to a simple proportional feedback wrapped around the\ndynamics of a single node. Higher-order motifs systematically provide further\nlayers and types of feedback to regulate the network response. Thus, the local\nconnectivity shapes temporal and spectral processing by the network as a whole,\nand we show how this enables robust, yet tunable, functionality such as\nextending the time constant with which networks remember past signals. Rich\nconnections between structure and function are developed for networks with\nrandom input and output weights, and those composed from nodes with distinct\ndynamics and connectivity. These simple statistical descriptions provide a\npowerful theoretical framework to understand the functionality of real-world\nnetwork systems, as we illustrate for the mouse brain connectome.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09073v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

Sober'], u'2016-05-29', u'A fundamental problem in neuroscience is to understand how sequences of\naction potentials ("spikes") encode information about sensory signals and motor\noutputs. Although traditional theories of neural coding assume that information\nis conveyed by the total number of spikes fired (spike rate), recent studies of\nsensory and motor activity have shown that far more information is carried by\nthe millisecond-scale timing patterns of action potentials (spike timing).\nHowever, it is unknown whether or how subtle differences in spike timing drive\ndifferences in perception or behavior, leaving it unclear whether the\ninformation carried by spike timing actually plays a causal role in brain\nfunction. Here we demonstrate how a precise spike timing code is read out\ndownstream by the muscles to control behavior. We provide both correlative and\ncausal evidence to show that the nervous system uses millisecond-scale\nvariations in the timing of spikes within multi-spike patterns to regulate a\nrelatively simple behavior - respiration in the Bengalese finch, a songbird.\nThese findings suggest that a fundamental assumption of current theories of\nmotor coding requires revision, and that significant improvements in\napplications, such as neural prosthetic devices, can be achieved by using\nprecise spike timing information.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09023v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Response statistics dissect the contributions of different sources of\n  variability to population activity in V1', ['Mihaly Banyai', 'Zsombor Koman', 'Gergo Orban'], u'2016-05-28', u"Response variability, as measured by fluctuating responses upon repeated\nperformance of trials, is a major component of neural responses, and its\ncharacterization is key to interpret high dimensional population recordings.\nResponse variability and covariability display predictable changes upon changes\nin stimulus and cognitive or behavioral state, providing an opportunity to test\nthe predictive power of models of neural variability. Still, there is little\nagreement on which model to use as a building block for population-level\nanalyses, and models of variability are often treated as a subject of choice.\nWe investigate two competing models, the Doubly Stochastic Poisson (DSP) model\nassuming stochasticity at spike generation, and the Rectified Gaussian (RG)\nmodel that traces variability back to membrane potential variance, to analyze\nstimulus-dependent modulation of response statistics. Using a model of a pair\nof neurons, we demonstrate that the two models predict similar single-cell\nstatistics. However, DSP and RG models have contradicting predictions on the\njoint statistics of spiking responses. In order to test the models against\ndata, we build a population model to simulate stimulus change-related\nmodulations in response statistics. We use unit recordings from the primary\nvisual cortex of monkeys to show that while model predictions for variance are\nqualitatively similar to experimental data, only the RG model's predictions are\ncompatible with joint statistics. These results suggest that models using\nPoisson-like variability might fail to capture important properties of response\nstatistics. We argue that membrane potential-level modelling of stochasticity\nprovides an efficient strategy to model correlations.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08909v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

[u'Michaelis-Menten dynamics in protein subnetworks', ['Katy J. Rubin', 'Peter Sollich'], u'2016-05-29', u'To understand the behaviour of complex systems it is often necessary to use\nmodels that describe the dynamics of subnetworks. It has previously been\nestablished using projection methods that such subnetwork dynamics generically\ninvolves memory of the past, and that the memory functions can be calculated\nexplicitly for biochemical reaction networks made up of unary and binary\nreactions. However, many established network models involve also\nMichaelis-Menten kinetics, to describe e.g. enzymatic reactions. We show that\nthe projection approach to subnetwork dynamics can be extended to such\nnetworks, thus significantly broadening its range of applicability. To derive\nthe extension we construct a larger network that represents enzymes and enzyme\ncomplexes explicitly, obtain the projected equations, and finally take the\nlimit of fast enzyme reactions that gives back Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The\ncrucial point is that this limit can be taken in closed form. The outcome is a\nsimple procedure that allows one to obtain a description of subnetwork\ndynamics, including memory functions, starting directly from any given network\nof unary, binary and Michaelis-Menten reactions.

For this purpose, we developed a model of dynamic\ntransport of the contrast fluid through the hierarchies of the perfusion trees.\nConceptually, computed time-space distributions of the so-called tissue density\ncan be compared with the measured data obtained from CT; such a modeling\nfeedback can be used for model parameter identification. The blood flow is\ncharacterized at several scales for which different models are used. Flows in\nupper hierarchies represented by larger branching vessels are described using\nsimple 1D models based on the Bernoulli equation extended by correction terms\nto respect the local pressure losses. To describe flows in smaller vessels and\nin the tissue parenchyma, we propose a 3D continuum model of porous medium\ndefined in terms of hierarchically matched compartments characterized by\nhydraulic permeabilities. The 1D models corresponding to the portal and hepatic\nveins are coupled with the 3D model through point sources, or sinks. The\ncontrast fluid saturation is governed by transport equations adapted for the 1D\nand 3D flow models.
