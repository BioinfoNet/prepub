[u'Criteria for folding in structure-based models of proteins', ['Karol Woek', 'Marek Cieplak'], u'2016-05-20', u'In structure-based models of proteins, one often assumes that folding is\naccomplished when all contacts are established. This assumption may frequently\nlead to a conceptual problem that folding takes place in a temperature region\nof very low thermodynamic stability, especially when the contact map used is\ntoo sparse. We consider six different structure-based models and show that\nallowing for a small, but model-dependent, percentage of the native contacts\nnot being established boosts the folding temperature substantially while\naffecting the time scales of folding only in a minor way. We also compare other\nproperties of the six models. We show that the choice of the description of the\nbackbone stiffness has a substantial effect on the values of characteristic\ntemperatures that relate both to equilibrium and kinetic properties. Models\nwithout any backbone stiffness (like the self-organized polymer) are found to\nperform similar to those with the stiffness, including in the studies of\nstretching.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06379v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Discreteness-induced transitions in multi-body reaction systems', ['Yohei Saito', 'Yuki Sughiyama', 'Kunihiko Kaneko', 'Tetsuya J. Kobayashi'], u'2016-05-20', u'A decrease in system size can induce qualitatively different behavior\ncompared to the macroscopic behavior of the corresponding large-size system.\nThe mechanisms of this transition, which is known as the small-size transition,\ncan be attributed to either a relative increase in the noise intensity or to\nthe discreteness of the state space due to the small system size. The former\nmechanism has been intensively investigated using several toy and realistic\nmodels. However, the latter has rarely been analyzed and is sometimes confused\nwith the former, because a toy model that extracts the essence of the\ndiscreteness-induced transition mechanism is lacking. In this work, we propose\na 1- and 3-body reaction system as a minimal model of the discreteness-induced\ntransition and derive the conditions under which this transition occurs in more\ncomplex systems. This work enriches our understanding of the influence of small\nsystem size on system behavior.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06273v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Evolutionary mixed games in structured populations: Cooperation and the\n  benefits of heterogeneity', ['Marco A. Amaral', 'Lucas Wardil', 'Matjaz Perc', 'Jafferson K. L. da Silva'], u'2016-05-20', u'Evolutionary games on networks traditionally involve the same game at each\ninteraction. Here we depart from this assumption by considering mixed games,\nwhere the game played at each interaction is drawn uniformly at random from a\nset of two different games. While in well-mixed populations the random mixture\nof the two games is always equivalent to the average single game, in structured\npopulations this is not always the case. We show that the outcome is in fact\nstrongly dependent on the distance of separation of the two games in the\nparameter space. Effectively, this distance introduces payoff heterogeneity,\nand the average game is returned only if the heterogeneity is small. For higher\nlevels of heterogeneity the distance to the average game grows, which often\ninvolves the promotion of cooperation. The presented results support preceding\nresearch that highlights the favorable role of heterogeneity regardless of its\norigin, and they also emphasize the importance of the population structure in\namplifying facilitators of cooperation.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06491v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

In this work we compare\nthe effects of seasonality in temperature that affect the entomological\nparameters of the mosquito with precipitation that affects the hatchery\ncapacity. We also analyze its joint action using a dynamical model for the life\ncycle of Aedes aegypti and historical weather data from 8 regions of Mexico. We\nfound that the joint action of different mechanisms can enhance the prevalence\nof the disease, but also inhibit it when they act in an asynchronous way. We\nfound that for the studied regions, the seasonality of the low temperature\nrather than mean temperature is the main driving force of Dengue outbreaks. We\nalso analyzed the role of the diapause in these kinds of outbreaks. The\nmethodology developed here can be used to discover the underlying mechanism of\nDengue outbreaks in different regions and thus help to apply targeted control\nmeasures.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06430v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'First Principles Attempt to Unify some Population Growth Models', ['Fabiano L. Ribeiro'], u'2016-05-20', u'In this work, some phenomenological models, those that are based only on the\npopulation information (macroscopic level), are deduced in an intuitive way.\nThese models, as for instance Verhulst, Gompertz and Bertalanffy models, are\nposted in such a manner that all the parameters involved have physical\ninterpretation. A model based on the interaction (distance dependent) between\nthe individuals (microscopic level) is also presented. This microscopic model\nreachs the phenomenological models presented as particular cases. In this\napproach, the Verhulst model represents the situation in which all the\nindividuals interact in the same way, regardless of the distance between them.\nThat means Verhulst model is a kind of mean field model. The other\nphenomenological models are reaching from the microscopic model according to\ntwo quantities: i) the relation between the way that the interaction decays\nwith the distance; and ii) the dimension of the spatial structure formed by the\npopulation. This microscopic model allows understanding population growth by\nfirst principles, because it predicts that some phenomenological models can be\nseen as a consequence of the same individual level kind of interaction. In this\nsense, the microscopic model that will be discussed here paves the way to\nfinding universal patterns that are common to all types of growth, even in\nsystems of very different nature.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06309v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

To assess\nthe combined impact of seed banks and selection on genetic diversity, we derive\na general diffusion model. We compute the equilibrium solution of the\nsite-frequency spectrum and derive the times to fixation of an allele with and\nwithout selection.

These results show that some Amerindian gene flow\ninto the Spanish group must have occurred since the first generation of\nColonial society, a finding that contrasts with the prevailing ideas that the\nSpanish elite avoided the intermarriage with other ethnic groups. Examples like\nthis one confirm that miscegenation began early in Costa Rica. So, those who\nconsidered themselves "Spaniards" in the late colonial era, were actually\nbiologically mestizos.

[u'Bidirectionality From Cargo Thermal Fluctuations in Motor-Mediated\n  Transport', ['Christopher E. Miles', 'James P. Keener'], u'2016-05-20', u'Molecular motor proteins serve as an essential component of intracellular\ntransport by generating forces to haul cargoes along cytoskeletal filaments. In\nsome circumstances, two species of motors that are directed oppositely (e.g.\nkinesin, dynein) can be attached to the same cargo. The resulting net motion is\nknown to be bidirectional, but the mechanism of switching remains unclear. In\nthis work, we propose a mean-field mathematical model of the mechanical\ninteractions of two populations of molecular motors with diffusion of the cargo\n(thermal fluctuations) as the fundamental noise source. By studying a\nsimplified model, the delayed response of motors to rapid fluctuations in the\ncargo is quantified, allowing for the reduction of the full model to two\n"characteristic positions" of each of the motor populations. The system is then\nfound to be "metastable", switching between two distinct directional transport\nstates, or bidirectional motion. The time to switch between these states is\nthen investigated using WKB analysis in the weak-noise limit.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06488v1', ['Subcellular Processes'], []]

Yet, the\ncharacterization of cultured stem cells at the level of morphology and\nmacroscopic patterns resulting from cell-to-cell interactions remain largely\nqualitative, even though they are the simplest features observed in everyday\nexperiments. Here we report that neural progenitor cells (NPCs), which are\nmultipotent stem cells that give rise to cells in the central nervous system,\nrapidly glide and stochastically reverse its velocity while locally aligning\nwith neighboring cells, thus showing features of an active nematic system.\nWithin the two-dimensional nematic pattern, we find interspaced topological\ndefects with +1/2 and -1/2 charges. Remarkably, we identified rapid cell\naccumulation leading to three-dimensional mounds at the +1/2 topological\ndefects. Single-cell level imaging around the defects allowed quantification of\nthe evolving cell density, clarifying that not only cells concentrate at +1/2\ndefects, but also escape from -1/2 defects.

[u'Collective migration under hydrodynamic interactions -- a computational\n  approach', ['Wieland Marth', 'Axel Voigt'], u'2016-05-19', u'Substrate-based cell motility is essential for fundamental biological\nprocesses, such as tissue growth, wound healing and immune response. Even if a\ncomprehensive understanding of this motility mode remains elusive, progress has\nbeen achieved in its modeling using a whole cell physical model. The model\ntakes into account the main mechanisms of cell motility - actin polymerization,\nsubstrate mediated adhesion and actin-myosin dynamics and combines it with\nsteric cell-cell and hydrodynamic interactions. The model predicts the onset of\ncollective cell migration, which emerges spontaneously as a result of inelastic\ncollisions of neighboring cells. Each cell here modeled as an active polar gel,\nis accomplished with two vortices if it moves. Open collision of two cells the\ntwo vortices which come close to each other annihilate. This leads to a\nrotation of the cells and together with the deformation and the reorientation\nof the actin filaments in each cell induces alignment of these cells and leads\nto persistent translational collective migration. The effect for low Reynolds\nnumbers is as strong as in the non-hydrodynamic model, but it decreases with\nincreasing Reynolds number.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06108v1', ['Cell Behavior'], []]
