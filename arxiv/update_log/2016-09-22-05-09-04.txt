[u'BioEM: GPU-accelerated computing of Bayesian inference of electron\n  microscopy images', ['Pilar Cossio', 'David Rohr', 'Fabio Baruffa', 'Markus Rampp', 'Volker Lindenstruth', 'Gerhard Hummer'], u'2016-09-21', u'In cryo-electron microscopy (EM), molecular structures are determined from\nlarge numbers of projection images of individual particles. To harness the full\npower of this single-molecule information, we use the Bayesian inference of EM\n(BioEM) formalism. By ranking structural models using posterior probabilities\ncalculated for individual images, BioEM in principle addresses the challenge of\nworking with highly dynamic or heterogeneous systems not easily handled in\ntraditional EM reconstruction. However, the calculation of these posteriors for\nlarge numbers of particles and models is computationally demanding. Here we\npresent highly parallelized, GPU-accelerated computer software that performs\nthis task efficiently. Our flexible formulation employs CUDA, OpenMP, and MPI\nparallelization combined with both CPU and GPU computing. The resulting BioEM\nsoftware scales nearly ideally both on pure CPU and on CPU+GPU architectures,\nthus enabling Bayesian analysis of tens of thousands of images in a reasonable\ntime. The general mathematical framework and robust algorithms are not limited\nto cryo-electron microscopy but can be generalized for electron tomography and\nother imaging experiments.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.06634v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Drifting states and synchronization induced chaos in autonomous networks\n  of excitable neurons', ['Rodrigo Echeveste', 'Claudius Gros'], u'2016-09-21', u'The study of balanced networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons has led\nto several open questions. On the one hand it is yet unclear whether the\nasynchronous state observed in the brain is autonomously generated, or if it\nresults from the interplay between external drivings and internal dynamics. It\nis also not known, which kind of network variabilities will lead to irregular\nspiking and which to synchronous firing states. Here we show how isolated\nnetworks of purely excitatory neurons generically show asynchronous firing\nwhenever a minimal level of structural variability is present together with a\nrefractory period. Our autonomous networks are composed of excitable units, in\nthe form of leaky integrators spiking only in response to driving inputs. For a\nnon-uniform network, composed exclusively of excitatory neurons, we find a rich\nrepertoire of self-induced dynamical states, including asynchronous drifting\nstates, fully synchronized, or mixed, containing both drifting and synchronized\ncomponents. The individual neurons considered are excitable and hence do not\ndispose of intrinsic natural firing frequencies. An effective network-wide\ndistribution of natural frequencies is however generated autonomously through\nself-consistent feedback loops. We find two types of asynchronous activity,\nwith the individual neurons spiking regularly in the pure drifting state,\nalbeit with a continuous distribution of firing frequencies. The activity of\nthe drifting component, however, becomes irregular in the mixed state, due to\nthe periodic driving of the synchronized component. We propose a new tool for\nthe study of chaos in spiking neural networks, which consists of an analysis of\nthe time series of pairs of consecutive interspike intervals. In this space, we\nshow that a strange attractor with a fractal dimension is formed.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.06462v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Do Japanese and Italian women live longer than women in Scandinavia?', ['rnulf Borgan'], u'2016-09-21', u'Life expectancies at birth are routinely computed from period life tables.\nSuch period life expectancies may be distorted by selection when comparing\ncountries where the living conditions improved earlier (like Norway and Sweden)\nwith countries where they improved later (like Italy and Japan). One way to get\na fair comparison between the countries, is to use cohort data and consider the\nexpected number of years lost before a given age a. Contrary to the results\nbased on period data, one then finds that Italian women may expect to lose more\nyears than women in Norway and Sweden, while there are no indications that\nJapanese women will lose fewer years than Scandinavian women.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.06424v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], [u'Department of Mathematics, University of Oslo']]
[u'Differential equations of electrodiffusion: constant field solutions,\n  uniqueness, and new formulas of Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz type', ['A. J. Bracken', 'L. Bass'], u'2016-09-21', u"The equations governing one-dimensional, steady-state electrodiffusion are\nconsidered when there are arbitrarily many mobile ionic species present, in any\nnumber of valence classes, possibly also with a uniform distribution of fixed\ncharges. Exact constant field solutions and new formulas of\nGoldman-Hodgkin-Katz type are found. All of these formulas are exact, unlike\nthe usual approximate ones. Corresponding boundary conditions on the ionic\nconcentrations are identified. The question of uniqueness of constant field\nsolutions with such boundary conditions is considered, and is re-posed in terms\nof an autonomous ordinary differential equation of order $n+1$ for the electric\nfield, where $n$ is the number of valence classes. When there are no fixed\ncharges, the equation can be integrated once to give the non-autonomous\nequation of order $n$ considered previously in the literature including, in the\ncase $n=2$, the form of Painlev\\'e's second equation considered first in the\ncontext of electrodiffusion by one of us. When $n=1$, the new equation is a\nform of Li\\'enard's equation.

Bois', 'Nazanin Golbamaki-Bakhtyari', 'Simona Kovarich', 'Emmanuel Lemazurier'], u'2016-09-13', u"Background: Combining computational toxicology with ExpoCast exposure data\nand ToxCast assay data gives us access to predictions of human health risks\nstemming from realistic exposures to chemical mixtures. Objectives: To\nquantify, through mathematical modeling and simulations, the size of potential\neffects of random mixtures of aromatase inhibitors on the dynamics of women's\nmenstrual cycle. Methods: We simulated random exposures to millions of\npotential mixtures of up to 256 aromatase inhibitors. A pharmacokinetic model\nof intake and disposition of the chemicals predicted their internal\nconcentration as a function of time (up to two years). A ToxCast aromatase\nassay provided concentration-inhibition relationships for each chemical. The\nresulting total aromatase inhibition was input to a mathematical model of the\nhormonal hypothalamus-pituitary-ovarian control of ovulation in women. Results:\nAbove 10% inhibition of estradiol synthesis by aromatase inhibitors, noticeable\n(eventually reversible) effects on ovulation were predicted. Exposures to\nindividual chemicals never led to such effects. Typically, more than 10% of the\ncombined exposures simulated had mild to catastrophic impacts on ovulation.\nConclusions: Those results demonstrate the possibility to predict large scale\nmixture effects for endocrine disrupters with a predictive toxicology approach,\nsuitable for high throughput ranking and risk assessment. The size of the\neffects predicted is consistent with an increased risk of infertility in women\nfrom daily life exposures to our chemical environment.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.06547v1', ['Tissues and Organs'], []]
[u'Comment on "On Uniqueness of SDE Decomposition in A-type Stochastic\n  Integration" [arXiv:1603.07927v1]', ['Peijie Zhou', 'Tiejun Li'], u'2016-09-21', u'The uniqueness issue of SDE decomposition theory proposed by Ao and his\nco-workers has recently been discussed. A comprehensive study to investigate\nconnections among different landscape theories [J. Chem. Phys. 144, 094109\n(2016)] has pointed out that the decomposition is generally not unique, while\nAo et al. (arXiv:1603.07927v1) argues that such conclusions are "incorrect"\nbecause of the missing boundary conditions. In this comment, we will combine\nliteratures research and concrete examples to show that the concrete and\neffective boundary conditions have not been proposed to guarantee the\nuniqueness, hence the arguments in [arXiv:1603.07927v1] are not sufficient.\nMoreover, we show that the "uniqueness" of the O-U process decomposition\nreferred by YTA paper is unable to serve as a counterexample to ZL\'s result\nsince additional assumptions have been made implicitly beyond the original SDE\ndecomposition framework, which cannot be applied to general nonlinear cases.\nSome other issues such as the failure of gradient expansion method will also be\ndiscussed. Our demonstration contributes to better understanding of the\nrelevant papers as well as the SDE decomposition theory.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.06587v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
[u'Unsupervised learning of transcriptional regulatory networks via latent\n  tree graphical models', ['Anthony Gitter', 'Furong Huang', 'Ragupathyraj Valluvan', 'Ernest Fraenkel', 'Animashree Anandkumar'], u'2016-09-20', u'Gene expression is a readily-observed quantification of transcriptional\nactivity and cellular state that enables the recovery of the relationships\nbetween regulators and their target genes. Reconstructing transcriptional\nregulatory networks from gene expression data is a problem that has attracted\nmuch attention, but previous work often makes the simplifying (but unrealistic)\nassumption that regulator activity is represented by mRNA levels. We use a\nlatent tree graphical model to analyze gene expression without relying on\ntranscription factor expression as a proxy for regulator activity. The latent\ntree model is a type of Markov random field that includes both observed gene\nvariables and latent (hidden) variables, which factorize on a Markov tree.\nThrough efficient unsupervised learning approaches, we determine which groups\nof genes are co-regulated by hidden regulators and the activity levels of those\nregulators. Post-processing annotates many of these discovered latent variables\nas specific transcription factors or groups of transcription factors. Other\nlatent variables do not necessarily represent physical regulators but instead\nreveal hidden structure in the gene expression such as shared biological\nfunction. We apply the latent tree graphical model to a yeast stress response\ndataset. In addition to novel predictions, such as condition-specific binding\nof the transcription factor Msn4, our model recovers many known aspects of the\nyeast regulatory network. These include groups of co-regulated genes,\ncondition-specific regulator activity, and combinatorial regulation among\ntranscription factors. The latent tree graphical model is a general approach\nfor analyzing gene expression data that requires no prior knowledge of which\npossible regulators exist, regulator activity, or where transcription factors\nphysically bind.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.06335v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
[u'Network-regularized Sparse Logistic Regression Models for Clinical Risk\n  Prediction and Biomarker Discovery', ['Wenwen Min', 'Juan Liu', 'Shihua Zhang'], u'2016-09-21', u'Molecular profiling data (e.g., gene expression) has been used for clinical\nrisk prediction and biomarker discovery. However, it is necessary to integrate\nother prior knowledge like biological pathways or gene interaction networks to\nimprove the predictive ability and biological interpretability of biomarkers.\nHere, we first introduce a general regularized Logistic Regression (LR)\nframework with regularized term $\\lambda \\|\\bm{w}\\|_1 +\n\\eta\\bm{w}^T\\bm{M}\\bm{w}$, which can reduce to different penalties, including\nLasso, elastic net, and network-regularized terms with different $\\bm{M}$. This\nframework can be easily solved in a unified manner by a cyclic coordinate\ndescent algorithm which can avoid inverse matrix operation and accelerate the\ncomputing speed. However, if those estimated $\\bm{w}_i$ and $\\bm{w}_j$ have\nopposite signs, then the traditional network-regularized penalty may not\nperform well. To address it, we introduce a novel network-regularized sparse LR\nmodel with a new penalty $\\lambda \\|\\bm{w}\\|_1 + \\eta|\\bm{w}|^T\\bm{M}|\\bm{w}|$\nto consider the difference between the absolute values of the coefficients. And\nwe develop two efficient algorithms to solve it. Finally, we test our methods\nand compare them with the related ones using simulated and real data to show\ntheir efficiency.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.06480v1', ['Genomics'], []]
