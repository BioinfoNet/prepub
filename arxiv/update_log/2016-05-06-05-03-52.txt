Using enhanced sampling techniques, we show for the first\ntime that, given a sufficiently large carbon nanotube, the confinement of a\ndouble-stranded DNA segment, 5'-D(*CP*GP*CP*GP*AP*AP*TP*TP*CP*GP*CP*G)-3', is\nthermodynamically favourable under physiological environments (134 mM, 310 K, 1\nbar), leading to DNA-nanotube hybrids with lower free energy than the\nunconfined biomolecule. A diameter threshold of 3 nm is established below which\nencapsulation is inhibited. The confined DNA segment maintains its\ntranslational mobility and exhibits the main geometrical features of the\ncanonical B form. To accommodate itself within the nanopore, the DNA end-to-end\nlength increases from 3.85 nm up to approximately 4.1 nm, due to a 0.3 nm\nelastic expansion of the strand termini. The canonical Watson-Crick H-bond\nnetwork is essentially conserved throughout encapsulation, showing that the\ncontact between the DNA segment and the hydrophobic carbon walls results in\nminor rearrangements of the nucleotides H-bonding.

We discover that\nall have net negative surface charges and permanent electric dipoles. Moreover\nboth SES area and surface charge as well as several physical and geometrical\nproperties defined by them change with protein size via well-fitted power laws.\nThe relevance to protein-solvent interaction of these physical and geometrical\nproperties is supported by strong correlations between them and known\nhydrophobicity scales and by their large changes upon protein unfolding. The\nuniversal existence of negative surface charge and dipole, the characteristic\nsurface geometry and power laws reveal fundamental but distinct roles of\nsurface charge and SES in protein-solvent interaction and make it possible to\ndescribe solvation and hydrophobic effect using theories on anion solute in\nprotic solvent.

Therefore, if we examine the braingraphs of $n$ subjects,\nthen we have $n$ graphs on the very same, anatomically identified vertex set.\nIt is a natural idea to describe the $k$-frequently appearing edges in these\ngraphs: the edges that are present between the same two vertices in at least\n$k$ out of the $n$ graphs.

In this paper, we propose a novel\nmiRNA precursor prediction algorithm, deepMiRGene, based on recurrent neural\nnetworks, specifically long short-term memory networks. deepMiRGene\nautomatically learns suitable features from the data themselves without manual\nfeature engineering and constructs a model that can successfully reflect\nstructural characteristics of precursor miRNAs. For the performance evaluation\nof our approach, we have employed several widely used evaluation metrics on\nthree recent benchmark datasets and verified that deepMiRGene delivered\ncomparable performance among the current state-of-the-art tools.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.00017v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Fast Simulation of Probabilistic Boolean Networks (Technical Report)', ['Andrzej Mizera', 'Jun Pang', 'Qixia Yuan'], u'2016-04-28', u'Probabilistic Boolean networks (PBNs) is an important mathematical framework\nwidely used for modelling and analysing biological systems. PBNs are suited for\nmodelling large biological systems, which more and more often arise in systems\nbiology. However, the large system size poses a~significant challenge to the\nanalysis of PBNs, in particular, to the crucial analysis of their steady-state\nbehaviour. Numerical methods for performing steady-state analyses suffer from\nthe state-space explosion problem, which makes the utilisation of statistical\nmethods the only viable approach. However, such methods require long\nsimulations of PBNs, rendering the simulation speed a crucial efficiency\nfactor. For large PBNs and high estimation precision requirements, a slow\nsimulation speed becomes an obstacle. In this paper, we propose a\nstructure-based method for fast simulation of PBNs. This method first performs\na network reduction operation and then divides nodes into groups for parallel\nsimulation. Experimental results show that our method can lead to an\napproximately 10 times speedup for computing steady-state probabilities of a\nreal-life biological network.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.00854v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Context-dependent metabolic networks', ['Mariano Beguerisse-Diaz', 'Gabriel Bosque', 'Diego Oyarzun', 'Jesus Pico', 'Mauricio Barahona'], u'2016-05-05', u'Cells adapt their metabolism to survive changes in their environment. We\npresent a framework for the construction and analysis of metabolic reaction\nnetworks that can be tailored to reflect different environmental conditions.\nUsing context-dependent flux distributions from Flux Balance Analysis (FBA), we\nproduce directed networks with weighted links representing the amount of\nmetabolite flowing from a source reaction to a target reaction per unit time.\nSuch networks are analyzed with tools from network theory to reveal salient\nfeatures of metabolite flows in each biological context. We illustrate our\napproach with the directed network of the central carbon metabolism of\nEscherichia coli, and study its properties in four relevant biological\nscenarios. Our results show that both flow and network structure depend\ndrastically on the environment: networks produced from the same metabolic model\nin different contexts have different edges, components, and flow communities,\ncapturing the biological re-routing of metabolic flows inside the cell. By\nintegrating FBA-based analysis with tools from network science, our results\nprovide a framework to interrogate cellular metabolism beyond standard pathway\ndescriptions that are blind to the environmental context.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01639v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
[u'Complete integrability of information processing by biochemical\n  reactions', ['Elena Agliari', 'Adriano Barra', 'Lorenzo Dello Schiavo', 'Antonio Moro'], u'2016-05-05', u'Statistical mechanics provides an effective framework to investigate\ninformation processing in biochemical reactions. Within such framework\nfar-reaching analogies are established among (anti-)cooperative collective\nbehaviors} in chemical kinetics, (anti-)ferromagnetic spin models in\nstatistical mechanics and operational amplifiers/flip-flops in cybernetics. The\nunderlying modeling -- based on spin systems -- has been proved to be accurate\nfor a wide class of systems matching classical (e.g. Michaelis--Menten, Hill,\nAdair) scenarios in the infinite-size approximation. However, the current\nresearch in biochemical information processing has been focusing on systems\ninvolving a relatively small number of units, where this approximation is no\nlonger valid. Here we show that the whole statistical mechanical description of\nreaction kinetics can be re-formulated via a mechanical analogy -- based on\ncompletely integrable hydrodynamic-type systems of PDEs -- which provides\nexplicit finite-size solutions, matching recently investigated phenomena (e.g.\nnoise-induced cooperativity, stochastic bi-stability, quorum sensing). The\nresulting picture, successfully tested against a broad spectrum of data,\nconstitutes a neat rationale for a numerically effective and theoretically\nconsistent description of collective behaviors in biochemical reactions.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01624v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
[u'Generalized Method of Moments for Estimating Parameters of Stochastic\n  Reaction Networks', ['Alexander Luck', 'Verena Wolf'], u'2016-05-04', u'Discrete-state stochastic models have become a well-established approach to\ndescribe biochemical reaction networks that are influenced by the inherent\nrandomness of cellular events. In the last years severalmethods for accurately\napproximating the statistical moments of such models have become very popular\nsince they allow an efficient analysis of complex networks. We propose a\ngeneralized method of moments approach for inferring the parameters of reaction\nnetworks based on a sophisticated matching of the statistical moments of the\ncorresponding stochastic model and the sample moments of population snapshot\ndata. The proposed parameter estimation method exploits recently developed\nmoment-based approximations and provides estimators with desirable statistical\nproperties when a large number of samples is available. We demonstrate the\nusefulness and efficiency of the inference method on two case studies. The\ngeneralized method of moments provides accurate and fast estimations of unknown\nparameters of reaction networks. The accuracy increases when also moments of\norder higher than two are considered. In addition, the variance of the\nestimator decreases, when more samples are given or when higher order moments\nare included.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01213v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
[u'Uniform asymptotic approximation of diffusion to a small target:\n  generalized reaction models', ['Sam Isaacson', 'Ava Mauro', 'Jay Newby'], u'2016-05-04', u'The diffusion of a reactant to a binding target plays a key role in many\nbiological processes. The reaction-radius at which the reactant and target may\ninteract is often a small parameter relative to the diameter of the domain in\nwhich the reactant diffuses. We develop uniform in time asymptotic expansions\nin the reaction-radius of the full solution to the corresponding diffusion\nequations for two separate reactant-target interaction mechanisms: the Doi or\nvolume reactivity model, and the Smoluchowski-Collins-Kimball partial\nabsorption model. These expansions are constructed by projecting out the\ncontribution of the first eigenvalue and eigenfunction to the solution of the\ndiffusion equation, and then developing matched asymptotic expansions in\nLaplace-transform space. Our approach offers an equivalent, but alternative,\nmethod to the pseudo-potential approach we previously employed in Isaacson and\nNewby 2013 for the simpler Smoluchowski pure absorption reaction mechanism. We\nfind that the resulting asymptotic expansions of the diffusion equation\nsolutions are identical with the exception of one parameter: the diffusion\nlimited reaction rates of the Doi and partial absorption models. This\ndemonstrates that for biological systems in which the reaction-radius is a\nsmall parameter, properly calibrated Doi and partial absorption models may be\nfunctionally equivalent.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01279v1', ['Subcellular Processes'], []]
[u'Immersed Boundary Simulations of Active Fluid Droplets', ['Carl A. Whitfield', 'Rhoda J.

We use an Immersed Boundary method to simulate\nthe fluid droplet interface as a Lagrangian mesh. We present results from two\nexample systems, firstly a droplet filled with an active polar fluid with polar\nanchoring at the droplet interface. Secondly, an active isotropic fluid\nconsisting of particles that can bind and unbind from the interface and\ngenerate surface tension gradients through active contractility. These two\nsystems demonstrate spontaneous symmetry breaking and steady state dynamics\nresembling cell motility and division and show complex feedback mechanisms with\nminimal degrees of freedom.

[u'Parallel Pairwise Correlation Computation On Intel Xeon Phi Clusters', ['Yongchao Liu', 'Tony Pan', 'Srinivas Aluru'], u'2016-05-05', u"Co-expression network is a critical technique for the identification of\ninter-gene interactions, which usually relies on all-pairs correlation (or\nsimilar measure) computation between gene expression profiles across multiple\nsamples. Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) is one widely used technique\nfor gene co-expression network construction. However, all-pairs PCC computation\nis computationally demanding for large numbers of gene expression profiles,\nthus motivating our acceleration of its execution using high-performance\ncomputing. In this paper, we present LightPCC, the first parallel and\ndistributed all-pairs PCC computation on Intel Xeon Phi clusters. It achieves\nhigh speed by exploring the SIMD-instruction-level and thread-level parallelism\nwithin Xeon Phis as well as accelerator-level parallelism among multiple Xeon\nPhis. To facilitate balanced workload distribution, we have proposed a general\nframework for symmetric all-pairs computation by building bijective functions\nbetween job identifier and coordinate space for the first time. We have\nevaluated LightPCC and compared it to the sequential C++ implementation in\nALGLIB (both use double-precision floating point) using a set of gene\nexpression datasets. Performance evaluation revealed that LightPCC runs up to\n20.6 and 218.2 faster than ALGLIB by using one and 16 Xeon Phi 5110P\ncoprocesssors, respectively. In addition, LightPCC demonstrated good parallel\nscalability in terms of number of Xeon Phis.
