The\nchallenge of such analysis comes from inherent anatomical and functional\nvariability across subjects. One approach to resolving this is a shared\nresponse factor model. This assumes a shared and time synchronized stimulus\nacross subjects. Such a model can often identify shared information, but it may\nnot be able to pinpoint with high resolution the spatial location of this\ninformation. In this work, we examine a searchlight based shared response model\nto identify shared information in small contiguous regions (searchlights)\nacross the whole brain. Validation using classification tasks demonstrates that\nwe can pinpoint informative local regions.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09432v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Is cortical criticality unique?', ['Kalris Kanders', 'Ruedi Stoop'], u'2016-09-29', u'There are indications that for optimizing neural computation, neural networks\n- including the brain - operate at criticality. Previous approaches have,\nhowever, used diverse fingerprints of criticality, leaving open the question\nwhether they refer to a unique critical point or whether there could be\nseveral. Using a recurrent spiking neural network as the model, we demonstrate\nthat avalanche criticality does not necessarily lie at the dynamical\nedge-of-chaos and that therefore, the different fingerprints indicate distinct\nphenomena with an as yet unclarified relationship.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09218v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Universal power-law scaling of water diffusion in human brain defines\n  what we see with MRI', ['Jelle Veraart', 'Els Fieremans', 'Dmitry S. Novikov'], u'2016-09-28', u'Development of successful therapies for neurological disorders depends on our\nability to diagnose and monitor the progression of underlying pathologies at\nthe cellular level. Physics and physiology limit the resolution of human MRI to\nmillimeters, three orders of magnitude coarser than the cell dimensions of\nmicrons. A promising way to access cellular structure is provided by\ndiffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI), a modality which exploits the sensitivity of the\nMRI signal to micron-level Brownian motion of water molecules strongly hindered\nby cell walls. By analyzing diffusion of water molecules in human subjects,\nhere we demonstrate that biophysical modeling has the potential to break the\nintrinsic MRI resolution limits. The observation of a universal power-law\nscaling of the dMRI signal identifies the contribution from water specifically\nconfined inside narrow impermeable axons, validating the overarching assumption\nbehind models of diffusion in neuronal tissue. This scaling behavior\nestablishes dMRI as an in vivo instrument able to quantify intra-axonal\nproperties orders of magnitude below the nominal MRI resolution, spurring our\nunderstanding of brain anatomy and function.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09145v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

Jelescu', 'Els Fieremans'], u'2016-09-28', u'Diagnosis of brain disorders is hindered by the lack of an imaging technique\nthat reveals the architecture of neuronal tissue at the cellular level, where\nthe associated pathological processes develop. Accessing tissue integrity at\nthe micrometer scale, three orders of magnitude below MRI resolution, would be\nakin to super-resolution in microscopy. For MRI, bridging the resolution gap\nrelies on biophysical modeling of water diffusion hindered by cell walls. Here\nwe develop a general framework for estimating orientational and microstructural\nparameters of neurites (axons and dendrites). By employing a set of rotational\ninvariants, we analytically reveal the nontrivial topology of parameter\nestimation landscape, showing that multiple branches of parameters describe the\nmeasurement almost equally well, with only one of them corresponding to the\nbiophysical reality. A comprehensive acquisition shows that the branch choice\ndiffers for white and for gray matter. Our framework reveals hidden\ndegeneracies in MRI parameter estimation for neuronal tissue, provides\nmicrostructural and orientational maps in the whole brain without constraints\nor priors, and connects modern biophysical modeling with clinical MRI.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09144v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

Function of\ndensity was suggested to be a balance of initial density minus mortality that\nwas dependent on initial spatial arrangement and mean horizontal size in the\nforest stand. Assuming initial spatial arrangement to be aggregation and\nperforming normalizations gave the self-thinning function depending on only two\nparameters, initial stem density and maximal horizontal size (represented by\nstem diameter). Normalizations included integral of probability of trees to\ncollide to be unity and stem density at maximal size to be zero.

[u'Deep Multi-Species Embedding', ['Di Chen', 'Yexiang Xue', 'Shuo Chen', 'Daniel Fink', 'Carla Gomes'], u'2016-09-28', u'Understanding how species are distributed across landscapes over time is a\nfundamental question in biodiversity research. Unfortunately, most species\ndistribution models only target a single species at a time, despite the fact\nthat there is strong evidence that species are not independently distributed.\nWe propose Deep Multi-Species Embedding (DMSE), which jointly embed vectors\ncorresponding to multiple species as well as vectors representing environmental\ncovariates into a common high dimensional feature space via a deep neural\nnetwork. Applied to \\textit{eBird} bird watching data, our single-species DMSE\nmodel outperforms commonly used random forest models in terms of accuracy. Our\nmulti-species DMSE model further improves the single species version. Through\nthis model, we are able to confirm quantitatively many species-species\ninteractions, which are only understood qualitatively among ecologists.

[u'When the clock strikes: Modeling the relation between circadian rhythms\n  and cardiac arrhythmias', ['Pavithraa Seenivasan', 'Shakti N. Menon', 'S. Sridhar', 'Sitabhra Sinha'], u'2016-09-29', u'It has recently been observed that the occurrence of sudden cardiac death has\na close statistical relationship with the time of day, viz., ventricular\nfibrillation is most likely to occur between 12 am-6 am, with 6 pm-12 am being\nthe next most likely period. Consequently there has been significant interest\nin understanding how cardiac activity is influenced by the circadian clock,\ni.e., temporal oscillations in physiological activity with a period close to 24\nhours and synchronized with the day-night cycle. Although studies have\nidentified the genetic basis of circadian rhythms at the intracellular level,\nthe mechanisms by which they influence cardiac pathologies are not yet fully\nunderstood. Evidence has suggested that diurnal variations in the conductance\nproperties of ion channel proteins that govern the excitation dynamics of\ncardiac cells may provide the crucial link. In this paper, we investigate the\nrelationship between the circadian rhythm as manifested in modulations of ion\nchannel properties and the susceptibility to cardiac arrhythmias by using a\nmathematical model that describes electrical activity in ventricular tissue. We\nshow that changes in the channel conductance that lead to extreme values for\nthe duration of action potentials in cardiac cells can result either in\nabnormally high-frequency reentrant activity or spontaneous conduction block of\nexcitation waves. Both phenomena increase the likelihood of wavebreaks that are\nknown to initiate potentially life-threatening arrhythmias. Thus, disruptive\ncardiac excitation dynamics are most likely to occur in time-intervals of the\nday-night cycle during which the channel properties are closest to these\nextreme values, providing an intriguing relation between circadian rhythms and\ncardiac pathologies.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09326v1', ['Tissues and Organs'], []]
[u"Transcriptional and translational regulation in Arc protein network of\n  Escherichia coli's stress response", ['Sutapa Mukherji'], u'2016-09-29', u'Recently, there has been a lot of effort in understanding sRNA mediated\nregulation of gene expression and how this mode of regulation differs from\ntranscriptional regulation.In E.coli, in the presence of oxidative stress, the\nsynthesis of sigma^s is regulated through an interesting mechanism involving\nboth transcriptional and sRNA-mediated translational regulation. The key\nregulatory factors involved in transcriptional and translational regulation are\nArcA and ArcB proteins and ArcZ sRNA, respectively. Phosphorylated ArcA, in a\nfeedforward mechanism, represses the transcriptions sigma^s and ArcZ sRNA with\nthe latter being a post-transcriptional activator for sigma^s. Through a\nfeedback mechanisms, ArcZ sRNA destabilises ArcB mRNA and regulates the level\nof ArcB protein, a kinase that phosphorylates ArcA. The oxygen and energy\navailability is expected to influence the ArcA phosphorylation rate and, as a\nconsequence, in equilibrium, the system is likely to be in either a high ArcB\n(low ArcZ) or a low ArcB (high ArcZ) state. Kinetic modelling studies suggest\nthat the rate of destabilisation of ArcB mRNA by ArcZ sRNA must be\nappropriately tuned for achieving the desired state. In particular, for a high\nphosphorylation rate, the transition from a low to a high ArcZ synthesis regime\nwith the increase in sRNA-mRNA interaction is similar to the threshold-linear\nresponse observed earlier. Further, we show that the mRNA destabilisation by\nsRNA might be, in particular, beneficial in the low phosphorylation state for\nhaving the right concentration levels of ArcZ and ArcB. Stochastic simulation\nresults suggest that as the ArcZ-ArcB binding affinity is increased, the\nprobability distribution for the number of ArcZ molecules becomes flatter\nindicating frequently occurring transcriptional bursts of varying strengths.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09202v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
