[u'Computing exponentially faster: Implementing a nondeterministic\n  universal Turing machine using DNA', ['Andrew Currin', 'Konstantin Korovin', 'Maria Ababi', 'Katherine Roper', 'Douglas B. Kell', 'Philip J. Day', 'Ross D. King'], u'2016-07-27', u'The theory of computer science is based around Universal Turing Machines\n(UTMs): abstract machines able to execute all possible algorithms. Modern\ndigital computers are physical embodiments of UTMs. The nondeterministic\npolynomial (NP) time complexity class of problems is the most significant in\ncomputer science, and an efficient (i.e. polynomial P) way to solve such\nproblems would be of profound economic and social importance. By definition\nnondeterministic UTMs (NUTMs) solve NP complete problems in P time. However,\nNUTMs have previously been believed to be physically impossible to construct.\nThue string rewriting systems are computationally equivalent to UTMs, and are\nnaturally nondeterministic. Here we describe the physical design for a NUTM\nthat implements a universal Thue system. The design exploits the ability of DNA\nto replicate to execute an exponential number of computational paths in P time.\nEach Thue rewriting step is embodied in a DNA edit implemented using a novel\ncombination of polymerase chain reactions and site-directed mutagenesis. We\ndemonstrate that this design works using both computational modelling and in\nvitro molecular biology experimentation. The current design has limitations,\nsuch as restricted error-correction. However, it opens up the prospect of\nengineering NUTM based computers able to outperform all standard computers on\nimportant practical problems.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.08078v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Autaptic Connections Shift Network Excitability and Bursting', ['Laura Wiles', 'Shi Gu', 'Fabio Pasqualetti', 'Danielle S. Bassett', 'David F. Meaney'], u'2016-08-01', u'Network architecture forms a critical constraint on neuronal function. Here\nwe examine the role of structural autapses, when a neuron synapses onto itself,\nin driving network-wide bursting behavior. Using a simple spiking model of\nneuronal activity, we study how autaptic connections affect activity patterns,\nand evaluate if neuronal degree or controllability are significant factors that\naffect changes in bursting from these autaptic connections. We observed that\nadding increasing numbers of autaptic connections to excitatory neurons\nincreased the number of spiking events in the network and the number of\nnetwork-wide bursts, particularly in the portion of the phase space in which\nexcitatory synapses were stronger contributors to bursting behavior than\ninhibitory synapses. In comparison, autaptic connections to excitatory neurons\nwith high average controllability led to higher burst frequencies than adding\nthe same number of self-looping connections to neurons with high modal\ncontrollability. The number of autaptic connections required to induce bursting\nbehavior could be lowered by selectively adding autapses to high degree\nexcitatory neurons. These results suggest a role of autaptic connections in\ncontrolling network-wide bursts in diverse cortical and subcortical regions of\nmammalian brain. Moreover, they open up new avenues for the study of dynamic\nneurophysiological correlates of structural controllability.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.00431v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Training and spontaneous reinforcement of neuronal assemblies by spike\n  timing', ['Gabriel Koch Ocker', 'Brent Doiron'], u'2016-07-30', u'The synaptic connectivity of cortex is plastic, with experience shaping the\nongoing interactions between neurons. Theoretical studies of spike\ntiming-dependent plasticity (STDP) have focused on either just pairs of neurons\nor large-scale simulations where analytic insight is lacking. A simple account\nfor how fast spike time correlations affect both micro- and macroscopic network\nstructure remains lacking. We develop a low-dimensional mean field theory\nshowing how STDP gives rise to strongly coupled assemblies of neurons with\nshared stimulus preferences, with the connectivity actively reinforced by spike\ntrain correlations during spontaneous dynamics. Furthermore, the stimulus\ncoding by cell assemblies is actively maintained by these internally generated\nspiking correlations, suggesting a new role for noise correlations in neural\ncoding. Assembly formation has often been associated with firing rate-based\nplasticity schemes; our theory provides an alternative and complementary\nframework, where temporal correlations and STDP form and actively maintain\nlearned structure in cortical networks.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.00064v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'A Binary Representation of the Genetic Code', ['Louis R. Nemzer'], u'2016-07-27', u'This article introduces a novel binary representation of the canonical\ngenetic code, in which each of the four mRNA nucleotide bases is assigned a\nunique 2-bit identifier. These designations have a physiological meaning\nderived from the molecular structures of, and relationships between, the bases.\nIn this scheme, the 64 possible triplet codons are each indexed by a 6-bit\nlabel. The order of the bits reflects the hierarchical organization manifested\nby the DNA replication/repair and tRNA translation systems. Transition and\ntransversion mutations are naturally expressed as basic binary operations, and\nthe severity of the different types is analyzed. Using a principal component\nanalysis, it is shown that physicochemical properties of amino acids related to\nprotein folding also correlate with particular bit positions of their\nrespective labels. Thus, the likelihood for a particular point mutation to be\nconservative, and therefore less likely to cause a change in protein\nfunctionality, can be estimated.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.00539v1', ['Other'], []]
[u'Direct quantification of brown algae-derived fucoidans in human plasma\n  by a fluorescent probe assay', ['Ulrich Warttinger', 'Christina Giese', 'Job Harenberg', 'Roland Kramer'], u'2016-07-30', u'Fucoidan is a generic term for a class of fucose rich, structurally diverse\nsulfated polysaccharides that are found in brown algae and other marine\norganisms. Depending on the species from which the fucoidan is extracted, a\nwide variety of biological activities including antitumor, antiinflammatory,\nimmune-modulating, antiviral, antibacterial and pro- and anticoagulant\nactivities has been described. Fucoidans have the advantage of low toxicity and\noral bioavailibiity and are viable drug candidates, preclinical and pilot\nclinical trials show promising results. The availability of robust assays, in\nparticular for analysing the blood levels of fucoidan, is a fundamental\nrequirement for pharmacokinetic analysis in drug development projects. This\ncontribution describes the application of a commercially availbale,\nprotein-free fluorescent probe assay (Heparin Red) for the direct\nquantification of several fucoidans (from Fucus vesiculosus, Macrocystis\npyrifera, and Undaria pinnatifida) in human plasma. By only minor adapation of\nthe established protocol for heparin detection, a concentration range 0,5 to 20\nmicrogram per mL fucoidan can be addressed. A preliminary analysis of matrix\neffects suggests acceptable interindividual variability and no interference by\nendogeneous chondroitin sulfate. This study identifies the Heparin Red assay as\na simple, time-saving mix-and-read method for the quantification of fucoidans\nin human plasma.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.00108v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Optimal control of treatment time in a diffuse interface model of tumor\n  growth', ['Harald Garcke', 'Kei-Fong Lam', 'Elisabetta Rocca'], u'2016-08-01', u'We consider an optimal control problem for a diffuse interface model of tumor\ngrowth. The state equations couples a Cahn-Hilliard equation and a\nreaction-diffusion equation, which models the growth of a tumor in the presence\nof a nutrient and surrounded by host tissue. The introduction of cytotoxic\ndrugs into the system serves to eliminate the tumor cells and in this setting\nthe concentration of the cytotoxic drugs will act as the control variable.\nFurthermore, we allow the objective functional to depend on a free time\nvariable, which represents the unknown treatment time to be optimized. As a\nresult, we obtain first order necessary optimality conditions for both the\ncytotoxic concentration and the treatment time.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.00488v1', ['Tissues and Organs'], []]
[u'Estimating Propensity Parameters using Google PageRank and Genetic\n  Algorithms', ['David Murrugarra', 'Jacob Miller', 'Alex Mueller'], u'2016-08-01', u'Stochastic Boolean networks or more generally, stochastic discrete networks,\nare an important class of computational models for molecular interaction\nnetworks. The stochasticity stems from the updating schedule. The standard\nupdating schedules include the synchronous update, where all the nodes are\nupdated at the same time, and the asynchronous update where a random node is\nupdated at each time step. The former gives a deterministic dynamics while the\nlatter a stochastic dynamics. A more general stochastic setting considers\npropensity parameters for updating each node. SDDS is a modeling framework that\nconsiders two propensity parameters for updating each node and uses one when\nthe update has a positive impact on the variable, that is, when the update\ncauses the variable to increase its value, and uses the other when the update\nhas a negative impact, that is, when the update causes it to decrease its\nvalue. This framework offers additional features for simulations but also adds\na complexity in parameter estimation of the propensities. This paper presents a\nmethod for estimating the propensity parameters for SDDS. The method is based\non adding noise to the system using the Google PageRank approach to make the\nsystem ergodic and thus guaranteeing the existence of a stationary distribution\nand then with the use of a genetic algorithm the propensity parameters are\nestimated. Approximation techniques that make the search algorithms efficient\nare also presented and Matlab/Octave code to test the algorithms are available\nat http://www.ms.uky.edu/~dmu228/GeneticAlg/Code.html.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.00535v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
