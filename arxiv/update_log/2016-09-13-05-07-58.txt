[u'Bayesian Model Averaging for Ensemble-Based Estimates of Solvation Free\n  Energies', ['Luke J. Gosink', 'Christopher C. Overall', 'Sarah M. Reehl', 'Paul D. Whitney', 'David L. Mobley', 'Nathan A. Baker'], u'2016-09-12', u"This paper applies the Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) statistical ensemble\ntechnique to estimate small molecule solvation free energies. There is a wide\nrange methods for predicting solvation free energies, ranging from empirical\nstatistical models to ab initio quantum mechanical approaches. Each of these\nmethods are based on a set of conceptual assumptions that can affect a method's\npredictive accuracy and transferability. Using an iterative statistical\nprocess, we have selected and combined solvation energy estimates using an\nensemble of 17 diverse methods from the SAMPL4 blind prediction study to form a\nsingle, aggregated solvation energy estimate. The ensemble design process\nevaluates the statistical information in each individual method as well as the\nperformance of the aggregate estimate obtained from the ensemble as a whole.\nMethods that possess minimal or redundant information are pruned from the\nensemble and the evaluation process repeats until aggregate predictive\nperformance can no longer be improved. We show that this process results in a\nfinal aggregate estimate that outperforms all individual methods by reducing\nestimate errors by as much as 91% to 1.2 kcal/mol accuracy. We also compare our\niterative refinement approach to other statistical ensemble approaches and\ndemonstrate that this iterative process reduces estimate errors by as much as\n61%. This work provides a new approach for accurate solvation free energy\nprediction and lays the foundation for future work on aggregate models that can\nbalance computational cost with predictive accuracy.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03257v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]

[u'Optimal Encoding and Decoding for Point Process Observations: an\n  Approximate Closed-Form Filter', ['Yuval Harel', 'Ron Meir', 'Manfred Opper'], u'2016-09-12', u"The process of dynamic state estimation (filtering) based on point process\nobservations is in general intractable. Numerical sampling techniques are often\npractically useful, but lead to limited conceptual insight about optimal\nencoding/decoding strategies, which are of significant relevance to\nComputational Neuroscience. We develop an analytically tractable Bayesian\napproximation to optimal filtering based on point process observations, which\nallows us to introduce distributional assumptions about sensor properties, that\ngreatly facilitate the analysis of optimal encoding in situations deviating\nfrom common assumptions of uniform coding. Numerical comparison with particle\nfiltering demonstrate the quality of the approximation. The analytic framework\nleads to insights which are difficult to obtain from numerical algorithms, and\nis consistent with biological observations about the distribution of sensory\ncells' tuning curve centers.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03519v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Differentially Categorized Structural Connectome Hubs are Involved in\n  Differential Microstructural Basis and Functional Implications and Contribute\n  to Individual Identification', ['Xindi Wang', 'Qixiang Lin', 'Mingrui Xia', 'Yong He'], u'2016-09-12', u'Human brain structural networks contain sets of centrally embedded hub\nregions that enable efficient information communication. However, it remains\nlargely unknown about categories of structural brain hubs and their\nmicrostructural, functional and cognitive characteristics as well as\ncontributions to individual identification. Here, we employed three multi-modal\nimaging data sets with structural MRI, diffusion MRI and resting-state\nfunctional MRI to construct individual structural brain networks, identify\nbrain hubs based on eight commonly used graph-nodal metrics, and perform\ncomprehensive validation analysis. We found three categories of structural hubs\nin the brain networks, namely, aggregated, distributed and connector hubs.\nSpatially, these distinct categories of hubs were primarily located in the\ndefault-mode system and additionally in the visual and limbic systems for\naggregated hubs, in the frontoparietal system for distributed hubs, and in the\nsensorimotor and ventral attention systems for connector hubs. Importantly,\nthese three categories of hubs exhibited various distinct characteristics, with\nthe highest level of microstructural organization in the aggregated hubs, the\nlargest wiring cost and topological vulnerability in the distributed hubs, and\nthe highest functional associations and cognitive flexibility in the connector\nhubs, although they behaved better regarding these characteristics compared to\nnon-hubs. Finally, all three categories of hub indices displayed high\nacross-session spatial similarities and acted as a structural fingerprint with\nhigh predictive rates (100%, 100% and 84.2%) for individual identification.\nCollectively, our findings highlighted three categories of brain hubs with\ndifferential microstructural, functional and cognitive associations, which may\nshed light on the topological mechanisms of the human connectome.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03372v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Puzzles in modern biology. II. Language, cancer and the recursive\n  processes of evolutionary innovation', ['Steven A. Frank'], u'2016-09-09', u'Human language emerged abruptly. Diverse body forms evolved suddenly.\nSeed-bearing plants spread rapidly. How do complex evolutionary innovations\narise so quickly? Resolving alternative claims remains difficult. The great\nevents of the past happened a long time ago. Cancer provides a model to study\nevolutionary innovation. A tumor must evolve many novel traits to become an\naggressive cancer. I use what we know or could study about cancer to describe\nthe key processes of innovation. In general, evolutionary systems form a\nhierarchy of recursive processes. Those recursive processes determine the rates\nat which innovations are generated, spread and transmitted.

[u'Extract fetal ECG from single-lead abdominal ECG by de-shape short time\n  Fourier transform and nonlocal median', ['Su Li', 'Hau-tieng Wu'], u'2016-09-09', u'The multiple fundamental frequency detection problem and the source\nseparation problem from a single-channel signal containing multiple oscillatory\ncomponents and a nonstationary noise are both challenging tasks. To extract the\nfetal electrocardiogram (ECG) from a single-lead maternal abdominal ECG, we\nface both challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel method to extract the\nfetal ECG signal from the single channel maternal abdominal ECG signal, without\nany additional measurement. The algorithm is composed of three main\ningredients. First, the maternal and fetal heart rates are estimated by the\nde-shape short time Fourier transform, which is a recently proposed nonlinear\ntime-frequency analysis technique; second, the beat tracking technique is\napplied to accurately obtain the maternal and fetal R peaks; third, the\nmaternal and fetal ECG waveforms are established by the nonlocal median. The\nalgorithm is evaluated on a simulated fetal ECG signal database ({\\em fecgsyn}\ndatabase), and tested on two real databases with the annotation provided by\nexperts ({\\em adfecgdb} database and {\\em CinC2013} database). In general, the\nalgorithm could be applied to solve other detection and source separation\nproblems, and reconstruct the time-varying wave-shape function of each\noscillatory component.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02938v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Bulging brains', ['J. Weickenmeier', 'P. Saez', 'A. Goriely', 'E. Kuhl'], u'2016-09-11', u'Brain swelling is a serious condition associated with an accumulation of\nfluid inside the brain that can be caused by trauma, stroke, infection, or\ntumors. It increases the pressure inside the skull and reduces blood and oxygen\nsupply. To relieve the intracranial pressure, neurosurgeons remove part of the\nskull and allow the swollen brain to bulge outward, a procedure known as\ndecompressive craniectomy. Decompressive craniectomy has been preformed for\nmore than a century; yet, its effects on the swollen brain remain poorly\nunderstood. Here we characterize the deformation, strain, and stretch in\nbulging brains using the nonlinear field theories of mechanics. Our study shows\nthat even small swelling volumes of 28 to 56 ml induce maximum principal\nstrains in excess of 30%. For radially outward-pointing axons, we observe\nmaximal normal stretches of 1.3 deep inside the bulge and maximal tangential\nstretches of 1.3 around the craniectomy edge. While the stretch magnitude\nvaries with opening site and swelling region, our study suggests that the\nlocations of maximum stretch are universally shared amongst all bulging brains.\nOur model can inform neurosurgeons and rationalize the shape and position of\nthe skull opening, with the overall goal to reduce brain damage and improve the\nstructural and functional outcomes of decompressive craniectomy in trauma\npatients.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03129v1', ['Tissues and Organs'], []]

[u'BAUM: A DNA Assembler by Adaptive Unique Mapping and Local\n  Overlap-Layout-Consensus', ['Anqi Wang', 'Zheng Li', 'Zhanyu Wang', 'Lei M. Li'], u'2016-09-10', u"Genome assembly from the high-throughput sequencing (HTS) reads is a\nfundamental yet challenging computational problem. An intrinsic challenge is\nthe uncertainty caused by the widespread repetitive elements. Here we get\naround the uncertainty using the notion of uniquely mapped (UM) reads, which\nmotivated the design of a new assembler BAUM. It mainly consists of two types\nof iterations. The first type of iterations constructs initial contigs from a\nreference, say a genome of a species that could be quite distant, by adaptive\nread mapping, filtration by the reference's unique regions, and reference\nupdating. A statistical test is proposed to split the layouts at possible\nstructural variation sites. The second type of iterations includes mapping,\nscaffolding/contig-extension, and contig merging. We extend each contig by\nlocally assembling the reads whose mates are uniquely mapped to an end of the\ncontig. Instead of the de Bruijn graph method, we take the\noverlap-layout-consensus (OLC) paradigm. The OLC is implemented by parallel\ncomputation, and has linear complexity with respect to the number of contigs.\nThe adjacent extended contigs are merged if their alignment is confirmed by the\nadjusted gap distance. Throughout the assembling, the mapping criterion is\nselected by probabilistic calculations. These innovations can be used\ncomplementary to the existing de novo assemblers. Applying this novel method to\nthe assembly of wild rice Oryza longistaminata genome, we achieved much\nimproved contig N50, 18.8k, compared with other assemblers. The assembly was\nfurther validated by contigs constructed from an independent library of long\n454 reads.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03073v1', ['Genomics'], []]
