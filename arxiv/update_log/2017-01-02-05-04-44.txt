[u'Selection originating from protein foldability: II. Folding free energy, sequence ensemble, and fitness', ['Sanzo Miyazawa'], u'2016-12-30', u'Assuming that mutation and fixation processes are reversible Markov processes, we prove that the equilibrium ensemble of sequences obeys a Boltzmann distribution with $\\exp(4N_e m (1 - 1/(2N)))$, where $m$ is a Malthusian fitness and $N_e$ and $N$ are the effective and actual population sizes. Combining this finding with the knowledge of protein folding, we derive a correspondence between protein fitness and folding free energy, i.e., $4N_e m (1 - 1/(2N))$ and $-\\Delta G_{ND}/k_B T_s$, where $\\Delta G_{ND} \\equiv G_N - G_D$, $G_N$ and $G_D$ are the native and denatured free energies, and $T_s$ is the effective temperature of natural selection. In the preceding manuscript, we analyzed dimensionless free energy changes, $\\Delta \\psi_N (= \\Delta G_N/k_B T_s)$, due to single nucleotide mutations, for which the total interaction $\\psi_N$ of a sequence was estimated from a multiple sequence alignment. Based on this analyis, we study the equilibrium state of protein stability in a monoclonal approximation, in which protein evolution proceeds with single amino acid substitutions fixed at a time in a population. The ensemble of proteins attains the equilibrium, $\\psi_N = \\psi_N^{eq}$, where the average of $\\Delta \\psi_{N}$ over fixed mutants is equal to zero. Approximating the probability density function (PDF) of $\\Delta \\psi_N$ by a log-normal distribution, the PDF of $\\Delta \\psi_{N} (\\simeq \\Delta\\Delta \\psi_{ND})$ in fixed mutants is estimated. $\\psi_N^{eq}$ for 14 protein domains agree well with $\\psi_N$ averaged over homologous sequences. The PDFs of $K_a/K_s$, which is the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rate per site, at equilibrium confirm that $T_s$ negatively correlates with the amino acid substitution rate. Contrary to the neutral theory, neutral selection is not significant even in fixed mutants.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.09379v1', ['Biomolecules', 'Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Selection originating from protein foldability: I. A new method to estimate selection temperature', ['Sanzo Miyazawa'], u'2016-12-30', u'The probability distribution of sequences with maximum entropy that satisfies a given amino acid composition at each site and a given pairwise amino acid frequency at each site pair is a Boltzmann distribution with $\\exp(-\\psi_N)$, where the total interaction $\\psi_N$ is represented as the sum of one body and pairwise interactions. A protein folding theory based on the random energy model (REM) indicates that the equilibrium ensemble of natural protein sequences is a canonical ensemble characterized by $\\exp(-\\Delta G_{ND}/k_B T_s)$ or by $\\exp(- G_{N}/k_B T_s)$ if an amino acid composition is kept constant, meaning $\\psi_N = \\Delta G_{ND}/k_B T_s +$ constant, where $\\Delta G_{ND} \\equiv G_N - G_D$, $G_N$ and $G_D$ are the native and denatured free energies, and $T_s$ is the effective temperature of natural selection. Here, we examine interaction changes ($\\Delta \\psi_N$) due to single nucleotide nonsynonymous mutations, and have found that the variance of their $\\Delta \\psi_N$ over all sites hardly depends on the $\\psi_N$ of each homologous sequence, indicating that the variance of $\\Delta G_N (= k_B T_s \\Delta \\psi_N)$ is nearly constant irrespective of protein families. As a result, $T_s$ is estimated from the ratio of the variance of $\\Delta \\psi_N$ to that of a reference protein, which is determined by a direct comparison between $\\Delta\\Delta \\psi_{ND} (\\simeq \\Delta \\psi_N)$ and experimental $\\Delta\\Delta G_{ND}$. Based on the REM, glass transition temperature $T_g$ and $\\Delta G_{ND}$ are estimated from $T_s$ and experimental melting temperatures ($T_m$) for 14 protein domains. The estimates of $\\Delta G_{ND}$ agree well with their experimental values for 5 proteins, and those of $T_s$ and $T_g$ are all within a reasonable range. This method is coarse-grained but much simpler in estimating $T_s$, $T_g$ and $\\Delta\\Delta G_{ND}$ than previous methods.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.09378v1', ['Biomolecules', 'Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Redundancy and synergy in dual decompositions of mutual information gain and information loss', ['Daniel Chicharro', 'Stefano Panzeri'], u'2016-12-30', u'Williams and Beer (2010) proposed a nonnegative mutual information decomposition, based on the construction of information gain lattices, which allows separating the information that a set of variables contains about another into components interpretable as the unique information of one variable, or redundant and synergy components. In this work we extend the framework of Williams and Beer (2010) focusing on the lattices that underpin the decomposition. We generalize the type of constructible lattices and examine the relations between the terms in different lattices, for example relating bivariate and trivariate decompositions. We point out that, in information gain lattices, redundancy components are invariant across decompositions, but unique and synergy components are decomposition-dependent. Exploiting the connection between different lattices we propose a procedure to construct, in the general multivariate case, information decompositions from measures of synergy or unique information. We introduce an alternative type of mutual information decompositions based on information loss lattices, with the role and invariance properties of redundancy and synergy components exchanged with respect to gain lattices. We study the correspondence between information gain and information loss lattices and we define dual decompositions that allow overcoming the intrinsic asymmetry between invariant and decomposition-dependent components, which hinders the consistent joint characterization of synergy and redundancy.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.09522v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Complimentary Phylogenetic Signals for Morphological Characters and Quantitative 3D Shape Data within genus Homo', ['Peter J. Waddell'], u'2016-12-30', u'Estimating the phylogeny of the genus Homo is entering a new phase of vastly improved data and methodology. There is increasing evidence of 6 to 10 competing species/lineages at any point in the last half million years, making the elucidation of the relationships of individual specimens particularly important. Recent estimates of the phylogeny of key specimens include Waddell (2013, 2014, 2015, 2016), and Mounier et al. (2016). These are made with quite different data (3D skull shapes and discrete morphological characters, respectively) and methods of analysis (unweighted least squares fitting of distances, OLS+, and reweighted maximum parsimony, respectively). Initial inspection of the trees in these articles might leave the impression of a great deal of disagreement and confused results. Here it is shown this need not be the case, and that these two types of data and analysis may be indicating a very similar tree, one that is in good agreement also with subjective current wisdom/expert opinions on particular parts of the phylogeny. The precise location of the African LH18 specimen arises as key to a better understanding of the likely form of the last common ancestors of H. sapiens and Neanderthals. A diverse approach seems to bring forth much more agreement of trees than otherwise perceived, and argues against being dogmatic about methods of phylogenetic analysis particularly when working with difficult problems.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.09595v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'A generative angular model of protein structure evolution', ['Michael Golden', 'Eduardo Garcia-Portugues', 'Michael Srensen', 'Kanti V. Mardia', 'Thomas Hamelryck', 'Jotun Hein'], u'2016-12-30', u'Recently described stochastic models of protein evolution have demonstrated that the inclusion of structural information in addition to amino acid sequences leads to a more reliable estimation of evolutionary parameters. We present a generative, evolutionary model of protein structure and sequence that is valid on a local length scale. The model concerns the local dependencies between sequence and structure evolution in a pair of homologous proteins. The evolutionary trajectory between the two structures in the protein pair is treated as a random walk in dihedral angle space, which is modelled using a novel angular diffusion process on the two-dimensional torus. Coupling sequence and structure evolution in our model allows for modelling both "smooth" conformational changes and "catastrophic" conformational jumps, conditioned on the amino acid changes. The model has interpretable parameters and is comparatively more realistic than previous stochastic models, providing new insights into the relationship between sequence and structure evolution. For example, using the trained model we were able to identify an apparent sequence-structure evolutionary motif present in a large number of homologous protein pairs. The generative nature of our model enables us to evaluate its validity and its ability to simulate aspects of protein evolution conditioned on an amino acid sequence, a related amino acid sequence, a related structure or any combination thereof.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.09474v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Population dynamics of synthetic Terraformation motifs', ['Ricard Sole', 'Raul Montanez', 'Salva Duran-Nebreda', 'Daniel R. Amor', 'Blai Vidiella', 'Josep Sardanyes'], u'2016-12-30', u'Ecosystems are complex systems, currently experiencing several threats associated with global warming, intensive exploitation, and human-driven habitat degradation. Such threats are pushing ecosystems to the brink of collapse. Because of a general presence of multiple stable states, including states involving population extinction, and due to intrinsic nonlinearities associated with feedback loops, collapse can occur in a catastrophic manner. Such catastrophic shifts have been suggested to pervade many of the future transitions affecting ecosystems at many different scales. Many studies have tried to delineate potential warning signals predicting such ongoing shifts but little is known about how such transitions might be effectively prevented. It has been recently suggested that a potential path to prevent or modify the outcome of these transitions would involve designing synthetic organisms and synthetic ecological interactions that could push these endangered systems out of the critical boundaries. Four classes of such ecological engineering designs or {\\em Terraformation motifs} have been defined in a qualitative way. Here we develop the simplest mathematical models associated with these motifs, defining the expected stability conditions and domains where the motifs shall properly work.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.09351v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Frequency dependent microbial growth during cycles of feast and famine', ['Jason Merritt', 'Seppe Kuehn'], u'2016-12-29', u'In Nature microbial populations are subject to fluctuating nutrient levels. Nutrient abundance fluctuations are important for evolutionary and ecological dynamics in microbial communities since they impact growth rates, population sizes and microbial physiology. Here we use automated continuous-culture devices and single-cell imaging to show that when populations of Escherichia coli are subject to cycles of nutrient excess (feasts) and scarcity (famine) that their growth rate during feasts depends on their history of exposure to famine. A model predicts that this dependence arises from increases in the duration of lag-phase with the duration of starvation. We validate this prediction using measurements of lag-phase duration.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.09330v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

[u'Bounds on stationary moments in stochastic chemical kinetics', ['Khem Raj Ghusinga', 'Cesar A. Vargas-Garcia', 'Andrew Lamperski', 'Abhyudai Singh'], u'2016-12-30', u'In the stochastic formulation of chemical kinetics, the stationary moments of the population count of species can be described via a set of linear equations. However, except for some specific cases such as systems with linear reaction propensities, the moment equations are underdetermined as a lower order moment might depend upon a higher order moment. Here, we propose a method to find lower, and upper bounds on stationary moments of molecular counts in a chemical reaction system. The method exploits the fact that statistical moments of any positive-valued random variable must satisfy some constraints. Such constraints can be expressed as nonlinear inequalities on moments in terms of their lower order moments, and solving them in conjugation with the stationary moment equations results in bounds on the moments. Using two examples of biochemical systems, we illustrate that not only one obtains upper and lower bounds on a given stationary moment, but these bounds also improve as one uses more moment equations and utilizes the inequalities for the corresponding higher order moments. Our results provide avenues for development of moment approximations that provide explicit bounds on moment dynamics for systems whose dynamics are otherwise intractable.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.09518v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'The impact of Gene Ontology evolution on GO-Term Information Content', ['Pietro Hiram Guzzi', 'Giuseppe Agapito', 'Marianna Milano', 'Mario Cannataro'], u'2016-12-30', u'The Gene Ontology (GO) is a major bioinformatics ontology that provides structured controlled vocabularies to classify gene and proteins function and role. The GO and its annotations to gene products are now an integral part of functional analysis. Recently, the evaluation of similarity among gene products starting from their annotations (also referred to as semantic similarities) has become an increasing area in bioinformatics. While many research on updates to the structure of GO and on the annotation corpora have been made, the impact of GO evolution on semantic similarities is quite unobserved. Here we extensively analyze how GO changes that should be carefully considered by all users of semantic similarities. GO changes in particular have a big impact on information content (IC) of GO terms. Since many semantic similarities rely on calculation of IC it is obvious that the study of these changes should be deeply investigated. Here we consider GO versions from 2005 to 2014 and we calculate IC of all GO Terms considering five different formulation. Then we compare these results. Analysis confirm that there exists a statistically significant difference among different calculation on the same version of the ontology (and this is quite obvious) and there exists a statistically difference among the results obtained with different GO version on the same IC formula. Results evidence there exist a remarkable bias due to the GO evolution that has not been considered so far. Possible future works should keep into account this consideration.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.09499v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Automatic labeling of molecular biomarkers of whole slide immunohistochemistry images using fully convolutional networks', ['Fahime Sheikhzadeh', 'Martial Guillaud', 'Rabab K. Ward'], u'2016-12-30', u'This paper addresses the problem of quantifying biomarkers in multi-stained tissues, based on color and spatial information. A deep learning based method that can automatically localize and quantify the cells expressing biomarker(s) in a whole slide image is proposed. The deep learning network is a fully convolutional network (FCN) whose input is the true RGB color image of a tissue and output is a map of the different biomarkers. The FCN relies on a convolutional neural network (CNN) that classifies each cell separately according to the biomarker it expresses. In this study, images of immunohistochemistry (IHC) stained slides were collected and used. More than 4,500 RGB images of cells were manually labeled based on the expressing biomarkers. The labeled cell images were used to train the CNN (obtaining an accuracy of 92% in a test set). The trained CNN is then extended to an FCN that generates a map of all biomarkers in the whole slide image acquired by the scanner (instead of classifying every cell image). To evaluate our method, we manually labeled all nuclei expressing different biomarkers in two whole slide images and used theses as the ground truth. Our proposed method for immunohistochemical analysis compares well with the manual labeling by humans (average F-score of 0.96).', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.09420v1', ['Tissues and Organs'], []]
[u'Effects of non-physiological blood pressure artefacts on measures of cerebral autoregulation', ['Adam Mahdi', 'Erica Rutter', 'Stephen J. Payne'], u'2016-12-29', u'Cerebral autoregulation refers to regulation mechanisms that aim to maintain cerebral blood flow approximately constant. It is often assessed by autoregulation index (ARI), which uses arterial blood pressure and cerebral blood flow velocity time series to produce a ten-scale index of autoregulation performance (0 denoting the absence of and 9 the strongest autoregulation). Unfortunately, data are rarely free from various artefacts. Here, we consider four of the most common non-physiological blood pressure artefacts (saturation, square wave, reduced pulse pressure and impulse) and study their effects on ARI for a range of different artefact sizes. We show that a sufficiently large saturation and square wave always result in ARI reaching the maximum value of 9. The pulse pressure reduction and impulse artefact lead to a more diverse behaviour. Finally, we characterised the critical size of artefacts, defined as the minimum artefact size that, on average, leads to a 10\\% deviation of ARI', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.09486v1', ['Tissues and Organs'], []]
[u'Acoustic response of phospholipid membranes: Estimating thermodynamic susceptibilities from fluorescence spectrum', ['Shamit Shrivastava', 'Matthias F. Schneider', 'Robin O. Cleveland'], u'2016-12-20', u'Membrane-protein systems constitute an important avenue for a variety of targeted therapies. The ability to alter these systems remotely via physical fields is highly desirable for the advance of noninvasive therapies. Biophysical action of acoustic fields in particular holds immense potential for applications in drug delivery and neuro-modulation. Here we investigate the optical response of solvato-chromic fluorescent probe Laurdan, embedded in multilamellar lipid vesicles, subjected to broadband pressure impulses of the order of 1Mpa peak amplitude and pulse width of less than 10{\\mu}s. The response is quantified in terms of the shift in fluorescence spectra using a ratiometric technique. Based on the fluctuation dissipation theorem applied to a coupled membrane-fluorophore system, it is shown that the perturbation of the fluorescence spectra of embedded molecules to the pressure impulses is determined by the thermodynamic state of the interface, or in other words, the thermodynamic susceptibilities such as the compressibility or heat capacity of the system. However, given that the thermodynamic susceptibilities of such systems, especially in native biological environment, are not easy to obtain experimentally, a necessary corollary to the thermodynamic approach is derived. This establishes a direct relation between the width of the emission spectra and the thermodynamic susceptibilities of the system. The result has practical importance as it gives access to the thermodynamic properties of the membrane from steady state fluorescence measurement without the need to perturb the system. Simply stated, the experiments show that the magnitude of the perturbation response of a membrane system to an acoustic insult is proportional to the width of the emission spectrum of the embedded membrane probe.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.06709v2', ['Subcellular Processes'], []]
[u'Discovery of cancer common and specific driver gene sets', ['Junhua Zhang', 'Shihua Zhang'], u'2016-12-30', u'Cancer is known as a disease mainly caused by gene alterations. Discovery of mutated driver pathways or gene sets is becoming an important step to understand molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis. However, systematically investigating commonalities and specificities of driver gene sets among multiple cancer types is still a great challenge, but this investigation will undoubtedly benefit deciphering cancers and will be helpful for personalized therapy and precision medicine in cancer treatment. In this study, we propose two optimization models to \\emph{de novo} discover common driver gene sets among multiple cancer types (ComMDP) and specific driver gene sets of one certain or multiple cancer types to other cancers (SpeMDP), respectively. We first apply ComMDP and SpeMDP to simulated data to validate their efficiency. Then, we further apply these methods to 12 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and obtain several biologically meaningful driver pathways. As examples, we construct a common cancer pathway model for BRCA and OV, infer a complex driver pathway model for BRCA carcinogenesis based on common driver gene sets of BRCA with eight cancer types, and investigate specific driver pathways of the liquid cancer lymphoblastic acute myeloid leukemia (LAML) versus other solid cancer types. In these processes more candidate cancer genes are also found.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.09478v1', ['Genomics'], []]
