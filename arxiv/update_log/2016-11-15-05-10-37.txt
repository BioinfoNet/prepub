In that case, a Poisson process is the\nmost common model of trial-to-trial variability. For a Poisson process, the\nvariance of the spike count is constrained to be equal to the mean,\nirrespective of the duration of measurements. Numerous studies have shown that\nthis relationship does not generally hold. Specifically, a majority of\nelectrophysiological recordings show an " over-dispersion " effect: Responses\nthat exhibit more inter-trial variability than expected from a Poisson process\nalone. A model that is particularly well suited to quantify over-dispersion is\nthe Negative-Binomial distribution model. This model is well-studied and widely\nused but has only recently been applied to neuroscience. In this paper, we\naddress three main issues. First, we describe how the Negative-Binomial\ndistribution provides a model apt to account for overdispersed spike counts.\nSecond, we quantify the significance of this model for any neurophysiological\ndata by proposing a statistical test, which quantifies the odds that\nover-dispersion could be due to the limited number of repetitions (trials). We\napply this test to three neurophysiological tests along the visual pathway.\nFinally, we compare the performance of this model to the Poisson model on a\npopulation decoding task.

This prevents one from evaluating\nthese experiments in terms of quantum contextuality if the latter understood\ntraditionally (as, e.g., in the Kochen-Specker theorem or Bell-type\ninequalities). The Contextuality-by-Default (CbD) theory separates\ncontextuality from inconsistent connectedness. When applied to quantum physical\nexperiments that exhibit inconsistent connectedness (due to context-dependent\nerrors and/or signaling), the CbD computations reveal quantum contextuality in\nspite of this. When applied to a large body of published behavioral\nexperiments, the CbD computations reveal no quantum contextuality: all\ncontext-dependence in these experiments is described by inconsistent\nconnectedness alone. Until recently, however, experimental analysis of\ncontextuality was confined to so-called cyclic systems of binary random\nvariables. Here, we present the results of a psychophysical double-detection\nexperiment that do not form a cyclic system: their analysis requires that we\nuse a recent modification of CbD, one that makes the class of noncontextual\nsystems more restricted. Nevertheless our results once again indicate that when\ninconsistent connectedness is taken into account, the system exhibits no\ncontextuality.

However, most earlier models use\nlocalist representations (codes) in each representational field, which we\nequate with the cortical macrocolumn (mac), at each level. In localism, each\nrepresented feature/event (item) is coded by a single unit. Our model, Sparsey,\nis also hierarchical but crucially, uses sparse distributed coding (SDC) in\nevery mac in all levels. In SDC, each represented item is coded by a small\nsubset of the mac's units. SDCs of different items can overlap and the size of\noverlap between items can represent their similarity. The difference between\nlocalism and SDC is crucial because SDC allows the two essential operations of\nassociative memory, storing a new item and retrieving the best-matching stored\nitem, to be done in fixed time for the life of the model. Since the model's\ncore algorithm, which does both storage and retrieval (inference), makes a\nsingle pass over all macs on each time step, the overall model's\nstorage/retrieval operation is also fixed-time, a criterion we consider\nessential for scalability to huge datasets. A 2010 paper described a\nnonhierarchical version of this model in the context of purely spatial pattern\nprocessing. Here, we elaborate a fully hierarchical model (arbitrary numbers of\nlevels and macs per level), describing novel model principles like progressive\ncritical periods, dynamic modulation of principal cells' activation functions\nbased on a mac-level familiarity measure, representation of multiple\nsimultaneously active hypotheses, a novel method of time warp invariant\nrecognition, and we report results showing learning/recognition of\nspatiotemporal patterns.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04023v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

Beside these hypotheses, a credible\nhypothesis proposed by this study to explain the cause of decision biasing,\nsuggests that the decision maker neuron can make use of the residual\ninformation of the previous decisions for the current decision.

The basic reproduction\nnumber R0 has been shown to be a threshold in such models with R0 > 1 a\nsufficient condition for persistence of the disease. It is also a sufficient\ncondition for the ability of the pathogen to invade. However, in the case of\ninvasion, infectious classes are initially present in small quantities. In this\ncase, random fluctuations drive the dynamics of the system. Several\ndeterministic models of Infectious Salmon Anemia virus (ISAv) in one and two\npatches are presented and recast as stochastic models to capture the effects of\nrandom fluctuations on disease outbreak. The probability of outbreak in these\nsystems is analyzed via the analysis of its complement, the probability of\ndisease extinction. It has been shown that under certain assumptions the\nprobability of extinction can be accurately approximated by multitype branching\nprocesses. The probability of extinction is approximated in each model for a\nvariety of initial conditions using branching process approximation and\nnumerical simulation. The single patch deterministic model is modified to\ninclude a more realistic force of infection. The equilibria of the modified\nsystem are determined along with its basic reproduction number, R0.\nFurthermore, an analogous stochastic model is proposed and the probability of\nextinction is determined. For branching process approximation to be accurate it\nhas long been known that the number of susceptible individuals at the disease\nfree equilibrium (DFE) must be sufficiently large.

One\nway to characterize movement performance is through measures of energy\nefficiency that relate the mechanical energy of the body and metabolic energy\nexpended by the muscles. We expect the practical utility of such measures to be\ngreater when human subjects execute movements that maximize energy efficiency.\nWe therefore seek to understand if and when subjects select movements with that\nmaximizing energy efficiency. We proceed using a model-based approach to\ndescribe movements which perform a task requiring the body to add or remove\nexternal mechanical work to or from an object. We use the specific example of\nwalking gaits doing external mechanical work by pulling a cart, and estimate\nthe relationship between the avg. walking speed and avg. step length. In the\nlimit where no external work is done, we find that the estimated maximum energy\nefficiency walking gait is much slower than the walking gaits healthy adults\ntypically select. We then modify the situation of the walking gait by\nintroducing an idealized mechanical device that creates an adjustable\nmechanical advantage. The walking gaits that maximize the energy efficiency\nusing the optimal mechanical advantage are again much slower than the walking\ngaits healthy adults typically select.
