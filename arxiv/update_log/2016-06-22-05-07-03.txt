[u'A stochastic model of supercoiling-dependent transcription', ['C. A. Brackley', 'J. Johnso', 'A. Bentivogli', 'S. Corles', 'N. Gilber', 'G. Gonnella', 'D. Marenduzzo'], u'2016-06-21', u'We propose a stochastic model for gene transcription coupled to DNA\nsupercoiling, where we incorporate the experimental observation that\npolymerases create supercoiling as they unwind the DNA helix, and that these\nenzymes bind more favourably to regions where the genome is unwound. Within\nthis model, we show that when the transcriptionally induced flux of\nsupercoiling increases, there is a sharp crossover from a regime where\ntorsional stresses relax quickly and gene transcription is random, to one where\ngene expression is highly correlated and tightly regulated by supercoiling. In\nthe latter regime, the model displays transcriptional bursts, waves of\nsupercoiling, and up-regulation of divergent or bidirectional genes. It also\npredicts that topological enzymes which relax twist and writhe should provide a\npathway to down-regulate transcription.

[u'A negative group delay model for feedback-delayed manual tracking', ['Henning U. Voss', 'Nigel Stepp'], u'2016-06-21', u'We propose that feedback-delayed manual tracking performance is limited by\nfundamental constraints imposed by the physics of negative group delay. To test\nthis hypothesis, the results of an experiment in which subjects demonstrate\nboth reactive and predictive dynamics are modeled by a linear system with\ndelay-induced negative group delay. Although one of the simplest real-time\npredictors conceivable, this model explains key components of experimental\nobservations. Most notably, it explains the observation that prediction time\nlinearly increases with feedback delay, up to a certain point when tracking\nperformance deteriorates. It also explains the transition from reactive to\npredictive behavior with increasing feedback delay. The model contains only one\nfree parameter, the feedback gain, which has been fixed by comparison with one\nset of experimental observations for the reactive case. Our model provides\nquantitative predictions that can be tested in further experiments.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06571v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'An artificial neural network to find correlation patterns among an\n  arbitrary number of variables', ['Alessandro Fontana'], u'2016-06-21', u'Methods to find correlation among variables are of interest to many\ndisciplines, including statistics, machine learning, (big) data mining and\nneurosciences. Parameters that measure correlation between two variables are of\nlimited utility when used with multiple variables. In this work, I propose a\nsimple criterion to measure correlation among an arbitrary number of variables,\nbased on a data set. The central idea is to i) design a function of the\nvariables that can take different forms depending on a set of parameters, ii)\ncalculate the difference between a statistics associated to the function\ncomputed on the data set and the same statistics computed on a randomised\nversion of the data set, called "scrambled" data set, and iii) optimise the\nparameters to maximise this difference. Many such functions can be organised in\nlayers, which can in turn be stacked one on top of the other, forming a neural\nnetwork. The function parameters are searched with an enhanced genetic\nalgortihm called POET and the resulting method is tested on a cancer gene data\nset. The method may have potential implications for some issues that affect the\nfield of neural networks, such as overfitting, the need to process huge amounts\nof data for training and the presence of "adversarial examples".', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06564v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'An active efficient coding model of the optokinetic nystagmus', ['Chong Zhang', 'Jochen Triesch', 'Bertram E. Shi'], u'2016-06-21', u'Optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) is an involuntary eye movement responsible for\nstabilizing retinal images in the presence of relative motion between an\nobserver and the environment. Fully understanding the development of\noptokinetic nystagmus requires a neurally plausible computational model that\naccounts for the neural development and the behavior. To date, work in this\narea has been limited. We propose a neurally plausible framework for the joint\ndevelopment of disparity and motion tuning in the visual cortex, the\noptokinetic and vergence eye movements. This framework models the joint\nemergence of both perception and behavior, and accounts for the importance of\nthe development of normal vergence control and binocular vision in achieving\nnormal monocular OKN (mOKN) behaviors. Because the model includes behavior, we\ncan simulate the same perturbations as performed in past experiments, such as\nartificially induced strabismus. The proposed model agrees both qualitatively\nand quantitatively with a number of findings from the literature on both\nbinocular vision as well as the optokinetic reflex. Finally, our model also\nmakes quantitative predictions about the OKN behavior using the same methods\nused to characterize the OKN in the experimental literature.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06443v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

However, the state of the art, based on total\nvariation or graph-net, is computationally costly. Here we introduce sparsity\nin the local neighborhood of each voxel with social-sparsity, a structured\nshrinkage operator. We find that, on brain imaging classification problems,\nsocial-sparsity performs almost as well as total-variation models and better\nthan graph-net, for a fraction of the computational cost.

Kinouchi'], u'2016-06-21', u'Phase transitions and critical behavior are crucial issues both in\ntheoretical and experimental neuroscience. We report analytic and computational\nresults about phase transitions and self-organized criticality (SOC) in\nnetworks with general stochastic neurons. The stochastic neuron has a firing\nprobability given by a smooth monotonic function $\\Phi(V)$ of the membrane\npotential $V$, rather than a sharp firing threshold. We find that such networks\ncan operate in several dynamic regimes (phases) depending on the average\nsynaptic weight and the shape of the firing function $\\Phi$. In particular, we\nencounter both continuous and discontinuous phase transitions to absorbing\nstates. At the continuous transition critical boundary, neuronal avalanches\noccur whose distributions of size and duration are given by power laws, as\nobserved in biological neural networks. We also propose and test a new\nmechanism to produce self-organized criticality (SOC): the use of dynamic\nneuronal gains $-$ a form of short-term plasticity probably in the axon initial\nsegment (AIS) $-$ instead of depressing synapses at the dendrites (as\npreviously studied in the literature). The new self-organization mechanism\nproduces a slightly supercritical state, that we called SOSC, in accord to some\nintuitions of Alan Turing.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06391v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Effects of Scan Length and Shrinkage on Reliability of Resting-State\n  Functional Connectivity in the Human Connectome Project', ['Amanda F. Mejia', 'Mary Beth Nebel', 'Anita D. Barber', 'Ann S. Choe', 'Martin A. Lindquist'], u'2016-06-19', u'In this paper, we use data from the Human Connectome Project (N=461) to\ninvestigate the effect of scan length on reliability of resting-state\nfunctional connectivity (rsFC) estimates produced from resting-state functional\nmagnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI). Additionally, we study the benefits of\nempirical Bayes shrinkage, in which subject-level estimates borrow strength\nfrom the population average by trading a small increase in bias for a greater\nreduction in variance. For each subject, we compute raw and shrinkage estimates\nof rsFC between 300 regions identified through independent components analysis\n(ICA) based on rsfMRI scans varying from 3 to 30 minutes in length. The time\ncourse for each region is determined using dual regression, and rsFC is\nestimated as the Pearson correlation between each pair of time courses.\nShrinkage estimates for each subject are computed as a weighted average between\nthe raw subject-level estimate and the population average estimate, where the\nweight is determined for each connection by the relationship of within-subject\nvariance to between-subject variance. We find that shrinkage estimates exhibit\ngreater reliability than raw estimates for most connections, with 30-40%\nimprovement using scans less than 10 minutes in length and 10-20% improvement\nusing scans of 20-30 minutes. We also observe significant spatial variability\nin reliability of both raw and shrinkage estimates, with connections within the\ndefault mode and motor networks exhibiting the greatest reliability and\nbetween-network connections exhibiting the poorest reliability. We conclude\nthat the scan length required for reliable estimation of rsFC depends on the\nspecific connections of interest, and shrinkage can be used to increase\nreliability of rsFC, even when produced from long, high-quality rsfMRI scans.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06284v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Speciation in the Derrida-Higgs model with finite genomes and spatial\n  populations', ['Marcus A.

We find that, for typical parameters used in the original model, it\ntakes of the order of $10^5$ genes. We compare the results with a similar\nspatially explicit model where about 100 genes suffice for speciation. We show\nthat when the number of genes is small the species that emerge are strongly\nsegregated in space. For larger number of genes, on the other hand, the spatial\nstructure of the population is less important and the species overlap\nconsiderably in space.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06559v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Genomic disintegration in woolly mammoths on Wrangel island', ['Rebekah L. Rogers', 'Montgomery Slatkin'], u'2016-06-20', u'Woolly mammoths (Mammuthus primigenius) populated Siberia, Beringea, and\nNorth America during the pleistocene and early holocene. Recent breakthroughs\nin ancient DNA sequencing have allowed for complete genome sequencing for two\nspecimens of woolly mammoths (Palkopoulou et al. 2015). One mammoth specimen is\nfrom a mainland population 45,000 years ago when mammoths were plentiful. The\nsecond, a 4300 yr old specimen, is derived from an isolated population on\nWrangel island where mammoths subsisted with small effective population size\nmore than 43-fold lower than previous populations. These extreme differences in\neffective population size o?er a rare opportunity to test nearly neutral models\nof genome architecture evolution within a single species. Using these\npreviously published mammoth sequences, we identify deletions, retrogenes, and\nnon-functionalizing point mutations. In the Wrangel island mammoth, we identify\na greater number of deletions, a larger proportion of deletions affecting gene\nsequences, a greater number of candidate retrogenes, and an increased number of\npremature stop codons. This accumulation of detrimental mutations is consistent\nwith genomic meltdown in response to low effective population sizes in the\ndwindling mammoth population on Wrangel island. In addition, we observe high\nrates of loss of olfactory receptors, either because these loci are\nnon-essential or because they were favored by divergent selective pressures in\nisland environments. Finally, at the locus of FOXQ1 we observe two independent\nloss-of-function mutations, which would confer a satin coat phenotype in this\nisland woolly mammoth.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06336v1', ['Populations and Evolution', 'Genomics'], []]

[u'Competitive binding of transcription factors drives Mendelian dominance\n  in regulatory genetic pathways', ['Adam H. Porter', 'Norman A. Johnson', 'Alexander Y. Tulchinsky'], u'2016-06-21', u"We report a new mechanism for allelic dominance in regulatory genetic\ninteractions that we call binding dominance. We investigated a biophysical\nmodel of gene regulation, where the fractional occupancy of a transcription\nfactor (TF) on the cis-regulated promoter site it binds to is determined by\nbinding energy (-{\\Delta}G) and TF concentration. Transcription and gene\nexpression proceed when the TF is bound to the promoter. In diploids,\nindividuals may be heterozygous at the cis-site, at the TF's coding region, or\nat the TF's own promoter, which determines allele-specific TF concentration. We\nfind that when the TF's coding region is heterozygous, TF alleles compete for\noccupancy at the cis sites and the tighter-binding TF is dominant in proportion\nto the difference in binding strength. When the TF's own promoter is\nheterozygous, the TF produced at the higher concentration is also dominant.\nCis-site heterozygotes have additive and therefore codominant phenotypes.\nBinding dominance extends to the expression of downstream loci and is sensitive\nto genetic background. While binding dominance is inevitable at the molecular\nlevel, it may be difficult to detect in the phenotype under some biophysical\nconditions, more so when TF concentration is high and allele-specific binding\naffinities are similar. A body of empirical research on the biophysics of TF\nbinding demonstrates the plausibility of this mechanism of dominance, but\nstudies of gene expression under competitive binding in heterozygotes in a\ndiversity of genetic backgrounds are needed.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06668v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
