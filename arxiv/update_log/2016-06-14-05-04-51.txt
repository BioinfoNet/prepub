[u'The Structures, Functions, and Evolution of Sm-like Archaeal Proteins\n  (SmAPs)', ['Cameron Mura'], u'2016-06-11', u'Sm proteins were discovered nearly 20 years ago as a group of small antigenic\nproteins ($\\approx$ 90-120 residues). Since then, an extensive amount of\nbiochemical and genetic data have illuminated the crucial roles of these\nproteins in forming ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes that are used in RNA\nprocessing, e.g., spliceosomal removal of introns from pre-mRNAs. Spliceosomes\nare large macromolecular machines that are comparable to ribosomes in size and\ncomplexity, and are composed of uridine-rich small nuclear RNPs (U snRNPs).\nVarious sets of seven different Sm proteins form the cores of most snRNPs.\nDespite their importance, very little is known about the atomic-resolution\nstructure of snRNPs or their Sm cores. As a first step towards a\nhigh-resolution image of snRNPs and their hierarchic assembly, we have\ndetermined the crystal structures of archaeal homologs of Sm proteins, which we\nterm Sm-like archaeal proteins (SmAPs).', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03630v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Flexibility of short DNA helices under mechanical stretching', ['Marco Zoli'], u'2016-06-11', u'The flexibility of short DNA fragments is studied by a Hamiltonian model\nwhich treats the inter-strand and intra-strand forces at the level of the base\npair. The elastic response of a set of homogeneous helices to externally\napplied forces is obtained by computing the average bending angles between\nadjacent base pairs along the molecule axis. The ensemble averages are\nperformed over a room temperature equilibrium distribution of base pair\nseparations and bending fluctuations. The analysis of the end-to-end distances\nand persistence lengths shows that even short sequences with less than $100$\nbase pairs maintain a significant bendability ascribed to thermal fluctuational\neffects and kinks with large bending angles. The discrepancies between the\noutcomes of the discrete model and those of the worm-like-chain model are\nexamined pointing out the inadequacy of the latter on short length scales.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03565v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Weak universality in sensory tradeoffs', ['Sarah Marzen', 'Simon DeDeo'], u'2016-06-13', u"For many organisms, the number of sensory neurons is largely determined\nduring development, before strong environmental cues are present. This is\ndespite the fact that environments can fluctuate drastically both from\ngeneration to generation and within an organism's lifetime. How can organisms\nget by by hard-coding the number of sensory neurons? We approach this question\nusing rate-distortion theory. A combination of simulation and theory suggests\nthat when environments are large, the rate-distortion function---a proxy for\nmaterial costs, timing delays, and energy requirements---depends only on\ncoarse-grained environmental statistics that are expected to change on\nevolutionary, rather than ontogenetic, timescales.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04057v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Towards an integration of deep learning and neuroscience', ['Adam Marblestone', 'Greg Wayne', 'Konrad Kording'], u'2016-06-13', u'Neuroscience has focused on the detailed implementation of computation,\nstudying neural codes, dynamics and circuits. In machine learning, however,\nartificial neural networks tend to eschew precisely designed codes, dynamics or\ncircuits in favor of brute force optimization of a cost function, often using\nsimple and relatively uniform initial architectures. Two recent developments\nhave emerged within machine learning that create an opportunity to connect\nthese seemingly divergent perspectives. First, structured architectures are\nused, including dedicated systems for attention, recursion and various forms of\nshort- and long-term memory storage. Second, cost functions and training\nprocedures have become more complex and are varied across layers and over time.\nHere we think about the brain in terms of these ideas. We hypothesize that (1)\nthe brain optimizes cost functions, (2) these cost functions are diverse and\ndiffer across brain locations and over development, and (3) optimization\noperates within a pre-structured architecture matched to the computational\nproblems posed by behavior. Such a heterogeneously optimized system, enabled by\na series of interacting cost functions, serves to make learning data-efficient\nand precisely targeted to the needs of the organism. We suggest directions by\nwhich neuroscience could seek to refine and test these hypotheses.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03813v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Balanced activation in a simple embodied neural simulation', ['Peter J. Hellyer', 'Claudia Clopath', 'Angie A. Kehagia', 'Federico E. Turkheimer', 'Robert Leech'], u'2016-06-11', u"In recent years, there have been many computational models exploring how\nspontaneous neural dynamics arise out of the brain's structural connectome.\nMost of these models have focused on the resting state (with no external input)\nor investigate the effects of simple sensory inputs. However, neural systems\nexist to process incoming information from the environment and to guide motor\noutput. Here, we explore a very simple neural network model (similar to that\nused previously to model dynamics at rest) and allow it to control a virtual\nagent in a very simple environment. This setup generates interesting\nbrain-environment interactions that suggest the need for homeostatic mechanisms\nto maintain rich spontaneous dynamics. We investigate roles for both local\nhomeostatic plasticity as well as macroscopic task negative activity (that\ncompensates for task positive, sensory input) in regulating activity in\nresponse to changing environment. Our results suggest complementary functional\nroles for both balanced local homeostatic plasticity and balanced task-positive\ntask negative activity in maintaining simulated neural dynamics in the face of\ninteractions with the environment. This work highlights the challenges that\nfeedback between environment and brain presents to neural models as well as the\ndifferent roles that balancing mechanisms may play; it also suggests a\nfunctional role for macroscopic task negative systems in the brain that may be\nof relevance to understanding large-scale brain systems such as the default\nmode network.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03592v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Birth-death processes with quenched uncertainty and intrinsic noise', ['Tobias Galla'], u'2016-06-13', u'The dynamics of populations is frequently subject to intrinsic noise. At the\nsame time unknown interaction networks or rate constants can present quenched\nuncertainty. Existing approaches often involve repeated sampling of the\nquenched disorder and then running the stochastic birth-death dynamics on these\nsamples. In this paper we take a different view, and formulate an effective\njump process, representative of the ensemble of quenched interactions as a\nwhole. Using evolutionary games with random payoff matrices as an example, we\ndevelop an algorithm to simulate this process, and we discuss diffusion\napproximations in the limit of weak intrinsic noise.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04050v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

Khan', 'Disha Malani', 'Astrid Murumagi', 'Olli Kallioniemi', 'Tero Aittokallio', 'Samuel Kaski'], u'2016-06-11', u'A key goal of computational personalized medicine is to systematically\nutilize genomic and other molecular features of samples to predict drug\nresponses for a previously unseen sample. Such predictions are valuable for\ndeveloping hypotheses for selecting therapies tailored for individual patients.\nThis is especially valuable in oncology, where molecular and genetic\nheterogeneity of the cells has a major impact on the response. However, the\nprediction task is extremely challenging, raising the need for methods that can\neffectively model and predict drug responses. In this study, we propose a novel\nformulation of multi-task matrix factorization that allows selective data\nintegration for predicting drug responses. To solve the modeling task, we\nextend the state-of-the-art kernelized Bayesian matrix factorization (KBMF)\nmethod with component-wise multiple kernel learning. In addition, our approach\nexploits the known pathway information in a novel and biologically meaningful\nfashion to learn the drug response associations. Our method quantitatively\noutperforms the state of the art on predicting drug responses in two publicly\navailable cancer data sets as well as on a synthetic data set. In addition, we\nvalidated our model predictions with lab experiments using an in-house cancer\ncell line panel. We finally show the practical applicability of the proposed\nmethod by utilizing prior knowledge to infer pathway-drug response\nassociations, opening up the opportunity for elucidating drug action\nmechanisms. We demonstrate that pathway-response associations can be learned by\nthe proposed model for the well known EGFR and MEK inhibitors.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03623v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Myocardial Architecture and Patient Variability in Clinical Patterns of\n  Atrial Fibrillation', ['Kishan A. Manani', 'Kim Christensen', 'Nicholas S. Peters'], u'2016-06-13', u"Atrial fibrillation (AF) increases the risk of stroke by a factor of four to\nfive and is the most common abnormal heart rhythm. The progression of AF with\nage, from short self-terminating episodes to persistence, varies between\nindividuals and is poorly understood. An inability to understand and predict\nvariation in AF progression has resulted in less patient-specific therapy.\nLikewise, it has been a challenge to relate the microstructural features of\nheart muscle tissue (myocardial architecture) with the emergent temporal\nclinical patterns of AF. We use a simple model of activation wavefront\npropagation on an anisotropic structure, mimicking heart muscle tissue, to show\nhow variation in AF behaviour arises naturally from microstructural differences\nbetween individuals. We show that the stochastic nature of progressive\ntransversal uncoupling of muscle strands (e.g., due to fibrosis or gap\njunctional remodelling), as occurs with age, results in variability in AF\nepisode onset time, frequency, duration, burden and progression between\nindividuals. This is consistent with clinical observations. The uncoupling of\nmuscle strands can cause critical architectural patterns in the myocardium.\nThese critical patterns anchor micro-re-entrant wavefronts and thereby trigger\nAF. It is the number of local critical patterns of uncoupling as opposed to\nglobal uncoupling that determines AF progression. This insight may eventually\nlead to patient specific therapy when it becomes possible to observe the\ncellular structure of a patient's heart.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03910v1', ['Tissues and Organs'], []]
