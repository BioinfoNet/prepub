[u'The Role of Word Length in Semantic Topology', ['Francesco Fumarola'], u'2016-11-15', u'A topological argument is presented concering the structure of semantic\nspace, based on the negative correlation between polysemy and word length. The\nresulting graph structure is applied to the modeling of free-recall\nexperiments, resulting in predictions on the comparative values of recall\nprobabilities. Associative recall is found to favor longer words whereas\nsequential recall is found to favor shorter words. Data from the PEERS\nexperiments of Lohnas et al. (2015) and Healey and Kahana (2016) confirm both\npredictons, with correlation coefficients $r_{seq}= -0.17$ and $r_{ass}=\n+0.17$. The argument is then applied to predicting global properties of list\nrecall, which leads to a novel explanation for the word-length effect based on\nthe optimization of retrieval strategies.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04842v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

While several groups\nhave reported such FC changes in PD, there are also significant discrepancies\nbetween studies. Investigating the reproducibility of PD-related FC changes on\nindependent datasets is therefore of crucial importance. We acquired\nresting-state fMRI scans for 43 subjects (27 patients and 16 normal controls,\nwith 2 replicate scans per subject) and compared the observed FC changes with\nthose obtained in two independent datasets, one made available by the PPMI\nconsortium (91 patients, 18 controls) and a second one by the group of Tao Wu\n(20 patients, 20 controls). Unfortunately, PD-related functional connectivity\nchanges turned out to be non-reproducible across datasets. This could be due to\ndisease heterogeneity, but also to technical differences. To distinguish\nbetween the two, we compared two random splits of the same dataset, obtained\neither: (a) by placing different subjects in the two splits, or (b) by\narranging that the two splits contain replicate scans of the same subjects. We\nobserved reproducibility in (b), but not in (a), indicative of disease\nheterogeneity. Contrary to PD, we observed reproducibility in (a) for a\ndifferent group contrast on a different rs-fMRI dataset (Beijing eyes open-eyes\nclosed). This suggests that functional heterogeneity may be a dominating factor\nbehind the lack of reproducibility of FC changes in different rs-fMRI studies\nof PD.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04794v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Comparison of Brain Networks with Unknown Correspondences', ['Sofia Ira Ktena', 'Sarah Parisot', 'Jonathan Passerat-Palmbach', 'Daniel Rueckert'], u'2016-11-15', u'Graph theory has drawn a lot of attention in the field of Neuroscience during\nthe last decade, mainly due to the abundance of tools that it provides to\nexplore the interactions of elements in a complex network like the brain. The\nlocal and global organization of a brain network can shed light on mechanisms\nof complex cognitive functions, while disruptions within the network can be\nlinked to neurodevelopmental disorders. In this effort, the construction of a\nrepresentative brain network for each individual is critical for further\nanalysis.

[u'Structure and Dynamics of Brain Lobes Functional Networks at the Onset\n  of Anesthesia Induced Loss of Consciousness', ['Eduardo C. Padovani'], u'2016-11-15', u'Anesthetic agents are neurotropic drugs able to induce dramatic alterations\nin the thalamo-cortical system, promoting a drastic reduction in awareness and\nlevel of consciousness. There is experimental evidence that general anesthesia\nimpacts large scale functional networks leading to alterations in the brain\nstate. However, the way anesthetics affect the structure assumed by functional\nconnectivity in different brain regions have not been reported yet. Within this\ncontext, the present study has sought to characterize the functional brain\nnetworks respective to the frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital lobes. In\nthis experiment, electro-physiological neural activity was recorded through the\nuse of a dense ECoG-electrode array positioned directly over the cortical\nsurface of an old world monkey of the species Macaca fuscata. Networks were\nserially estimated over time at each five seconds, while the animal model was\nunder controlled experimental conditions of an anesthetic induction process. In\neach one of the four cortical brain lobes, prominent alterations on distinct\nproperties of the networks evidenced a transition in the networks architecture,\nwhich occurred within about one and a half minutes after the administration of\nthe anesthetics. The characterization of functional brain networks performed in\nthis study represents important experimental evidence and brings new knowledge\ntowards the understanding of neural correlates of consciousness in terms of the\nstructure and properties of the functional brain networks.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04758v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

[u'Evaluation of vaccination strategies for SIR epidemics on random\n  networks incorporating household structure', ['Frank Ball', 'David Sirl'], u'2016-11-15', u'This paper is concerned with the analysis of vaccination strategies in a\nstochastic SIR (susceptible $\\to$ infected $\\to$ removed) model for the spread\nof an epidemic amongst a population of individuals with a random network of\nsocial contacts that is also partitioned into households. Under various vaccine\naction models, we consider both household-based vaccination schemes, in which\nthe way in which individuals are chosen for vaccination depends on the size of\nthe households in which they reside, and acquaintance vaccination, which\ntargets individuals of high degree in the social network. For both types of\nvaccination scheme, assuming a large population with few initial infectives, we\nderive a threshold parameter which determines whether or not a large outbreak\ncan occur and also the probability and fraction of the population infected by\nsuch an outbreak. The performance of these schemes is studied numerically,\nfocusing on the influence of the household size distribution and the degree\ndistribution of the social network. We find that acquaintance vaccination can\nsignificantly outperform the best household-based scheme if the degree\ndistribution of the social network is heavy-tailed. For household-based\nschemes, when the vaccine coverage is insufficient to prevent a major outbreak\nand the vaccine is imperfect, we find situations in which both the probability\nand size of a major outbreak under the scheme which minimises the threshold\nparameter are \\emph{larger} than in the scheme which maximises the threshold\nparameter.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04818v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

[u'An Epidemiological Model of Malaria Accounting for Asymptomatic Carriers', ['Jacob B. Aguilar', 'Juan B. Gutierrez'], u'2016-11-15', u'Asymptomatic individuals in the context of malarial disease refers to\nsubjects who carry a parasite load but do not show clinical symptoms. A correct\nunderstanding of the influence of asymptomatic individuals on transmission\ndynamics will provide a comprehensive description of the complex interplay\nbetween the definitive host (female \\textit{Anopheles} mosquito), intermediate\nhost (human) and agent (\\textit{Plasmodium} parasite). The goal of this article\nis to conduct a rigorous mathematical analysis of a new compartmentalized\nmalaria model accounting for asymptomatic human hosts for the purpose of\ncalculating the basic reproductive number ($\\mathcal{R}_0$), and determining\nthe bifurcations that might occur at the onset of disease free equilibrium. A\npoint of departure of this model from others appearing in literature is that\nthe asymptomatic compartment is decomposed into two mutually disjoint\nsub-compartments by making use of the naturally acquired immunity (NAI) of the\npopulation under consideration. After deriving the model, a qualitative\nanalysis is carried out to classify the stability of the equilibria of the\nsystem. Our results show that the dynamical system is locally asymptotically\nstable provided that $\\mathcal{R}_0<1$. However this stability is not global,\nowning to the occurrence of a sub-critical bifurcation in which additional\nnon-trivial sub-threshold equilibrium solutions appear in response to a\nspecified parameter being perturbed. To ensure that the model does not undergo\na backward bifurcation, we demand that an auxiliary parameter denoted\n$\\Lambda<1$ in addition to the threshold constraint $\\mathcal{R}_0<1$. The\nauthors hope that this qualitative analysis will fill in the gaps of what is\ncurrently known about asymptomatic malaria and aid in designing strategies that\nassist the further development of malaria control and eradication efforts.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04668v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

[u'Modeling potent pathways for APC/C inhibition: pivotal roles for MCC and\n  BubR1', ['Bashar Ibrahim'], u'2016-11-15', u'The highly conserved spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) ensures that the\nsister chromatids of the duplicated genome are not separated and distributed to\nthe spindle poles before all chromosomes have been properly linked to the\nmicrotubules of the mitotic spindle. Biochemically, the SAC delays cell cycle\nprogression by preventing activation of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C)\nor cyclosome; whose activation by Cdc20 is required for sister-chromatid\nseparation, which marks the transition into anaphase. In response to activation\nof the checkpoint, various species control the activity of both APC/C and\nCdc20. However, the underlying regulatory pathways remain largely elusive. In\nthis study, five possible model variants of APC/C regulation were constructed,\nnamely BubR1, Mad2, MCC, MCF2 and an all-pathways model variant. These models\nare validated with experimental data from the literature. A wide range of\nparameter values have been tested to find critical values of the APC binding\nrate. The results show that all variants are able to capture the wild type\nbehaviour of the APC. However, only one model variant, which included both MCC\nas well as BubR1 as potent inhibitors of the APC, was able to reproduce both\nwild type and mutant type behaviour of APC regulation. The presented work has\nsuccessfully distinguished between five competing dynamical models of the same\nbiological system using a systems biology approach. Furthermore, the results\nsuggest that systems-level approach is vital for molecular biology and could\nalso be used for compare the pathways of relevance with the objective to\ngenerate hypotheses and improve our understanding.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04781v1', ['Molecular Networks', 'Cell Behavior'], []]
[u'Toward a systems-level view of mitotic checkpoints', ['Bashar Ibrahim'], u'2016-11-15', u'Reproduction and natural selection are the key elements of life. In order to\nreproduce, the genetic material must be doubled, separated and placed into two\nnew daughter cells, each containing a complete set of chromosomes and\norganelles. In mitosis, transition from one process to the next is guided by\nintricate surveillance mechanisms, known as the mitotic checkpoints.\nDis-regulation of cell division through checkpoint malfunction can lead to\ndevelopmental defects and contribute to the development or progression of\ntumors. This review approaches two important mitotic checkpoints, the spindle\nassembly checkpoint (SAC) and the spindle position checkpoint (SPOC). The\nhighly conserved spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) controls the onset of\nanaphase by preventing premature segregation of the sister chromatids of the\nduplicated genome, to the spindle poles. In contrast, the spindle position\ncheckpoint (SPOC), in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae, ensures that during\nasymmetric cell division mitotic exit does not occur until the spindle is\nproperly aligned with the cell polarity axis.
