[u'Fruitful symbioses between termites and computers', ['Og DeSouza', 'Elio Tuci', 'Octavio Miramontes'], u'2016-08-18', u'The living-together of distinct organisms in a single termite nest along with\nthe termite builder colony, is emblematic in its ecological and evolutionary\nsignificance. On top of preserving biodiversity, these interspecific and\nintraspecific symbioses provide useful examples of interindividual associations\nthought to underly transitions in organic evolution. Being interindividual in\nnature, such processes may involve emergent phenomena and hence call for\nanalytical solutions provided by computing tools and modelling, as opposed to\nclassical biological methods of analysis. Here we provide selected examples of\nsuch solutions, showing that termite studies may profit from a symbiotic-like\nlink with computing science to open up wide and new research avenues in ecology\nand evolution.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05367v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Time scales and species coexistence in chaotic flows', ['Tobias Galla', 'Vicente Perez-Munuzuri'], u'2016-08-18', u'Empirical observations in marine ecosystems have suggested a balance of\nbiological and advection time scales as a possible explanation of species\ncoexistence. To characterise this scenario, we measure the time to fixation in\nneutrally evolving populations in chaotic flows. Contrary to intuition the\nvariation of time scales does not interpolate straightforwardly between the\nno-flow and well-mixed limits; instead we find that fixation is the slowest at\nintermediate Damk\\"ohler numbers, indicating long-lasting coexistence of\nspecies. Our analysis shows that this slowdown is due to spatial organisation\non an increasingly modularised network. We also find that diffusion can either\nslow down or speed up fixation, depending on the relative time scales of flow\nand evolution.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05166v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Pulsatile lipid vesicles under osmotic stress', ['Morgan Chabanon', 'James C. S. Ho', 'Bo Liedberg', 'Atul N. Parikh', 'Padmini Rangamani'], u'2016-08-18', u"The response of lipid bilayers to osmotic stress is an important part of\ncellular function. Previously, in [Oglecka et al. 2014], we reported that\ncell-sized giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) exposed to hypotonic media,\nrespond to the osmotic assault by undergoing a cyclical sequence of swelling\nand bursting events, coupled to the membrane's compositional degrees of\nfreedom. Here, we seek to deepen our quantitative understanding of the\nessential pulsatile behavior of GUVs under hypotonic conditions, by advancing a\ncomprehensive theoretical model for vesicle dynamics. The model quantitatively\ncaptures our experimentally measured swell-burst parameters for\nsingle-component GUVs, and reveals that thermal fluctuations enable rate\ndependent pore nucleation, driving the dynamics of the swell-burst cycles. We\nfurther identify new scaling relationships between the pulsatile dynamics and\nGUV properties. Our findings provide a fundamental framework that has the\npotential to guide future investigations on the non-equilibrium dynamics of\nvesicles under osmotic stress.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05364v1', ['Subcellular Processes'], []]
