[u'Consensus clustering approach to group brain connectivity matrices', ['Javier Rasero', 'Mario Pellicoro', 'Leonardo Angelini', 'Jesus M. Cortes', 'Daniele Marinazzo', 'Sebastiano Stramaglia'], u'2016-12-12', u'A novel approach rooted on the notion of consensus clustering, a strategy developed for community detection in complex networks, is proposed to cope with the heterogeneity that characterizes connectivity matrices in healthy and disease. The method can be summarized as follows: (i) define, for each node, of a distance matrix for the set of subjects (ii) cluster the distance matrix for each node, (iii) build the consensus network from the corresponding partitions and (iv) extract groups of subjects by finding the communities of the consensus network thus obtained. Applications on a toy model and two real data sets, show the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, which represents heterogeneity of a set of subjects in terms of a weighted network, the consensus matrix.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03760v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Random-walk modeling of free-recall anomalies - Part 1: Contiguity and inter-response intervals', ['Francesco Fumarola'], u'2016-12-12', u'A comparison of three different experimental datasets leads to the identification of an apparently robust feature of free-recall data: a minimum in the rate of contiguous recall near the beginning of the recall process. By simulating verbal retrieval as a homogenous Markov chain with the experimentally observed transition matrix, I show that this behavior cannot be explained in terms of the nonequilibrium initial conditions. I deduce that the process, if markovian, is inhomogenous and I identify a psychological mechanism that would effectively lead to a time-dependent transition matrix. The theory is based on the simultaneous coexistence of competing random walks, all of them homogenous but liable to losing permanently the right to effect retrieval. To test this hypothesis, I construct a many-particle model governed by two free parameters and simulate it with initial conditions taken from the data. Besides reproducing the contiguous-recall curve, the theory leads to a counterintuitive prediction on the behavior of the inter-response intervals as a function of the serial-position lag. Data are found to confirm this prediction. I proceed then to investigate possible consequences of the model, drawing in part on a comparison with classical results from experiments on category recall.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03649v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Do retinal ganglion cells project natural scenes to their principal subspace and whiten them?', ['Reza Abbasi-Asl', 'Cengiz Pehlevan', 'Bin Yu', 'Dmitri B. Chklovskii'], u'2016-12-11', u'Several theories of early sensory processing suggest that it whitens sensory stimuli. Here, we test three key predictions of the whitening theory using recordings from 152 ganglion cells in salamander retina responding to natural movies. We confirm the previous finding that firing rates of ganglion cells are less correlated compared to natural scenes, although significant correlations remain. We show that while the power spectrum of ganglion cells decays less steeply than that of natural scenes, it is not completely flattened. Finally, we find evidence that only the top principal components of the visual stimulus are transmitted.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03483v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Self-calibrating Neural Networks for Dimensionality Reduction', ['Yuansi Chen', 'Cengiz Pehlevan', 'Dmitri B. Chklovskii'], u'2016-12-11', u'Recently, a novel family of biologically plausible online algorithms for reducing the dimensionality of streaming data has been derived from the similarity matching principle. In these algorithms, the number of output dimensions can be determined adaptively by thresholding the singular values of the input data matrix. However, setting such threshold requires knowing the magnitude of the desired singular values in advance. Here we propose online algorithms where the threshold is self-calibrating based on the singular values computed from the existing observations. To derive these algorithms from the similarity matching cost function we propose novel regularizers. As before, these online algorithms can be implemented by Hebbian/anti-Hebbian neural networks in which the learning rule depends on the chosen regularizer. We demonstrate both mathematically and via simulation the effectiveness of these online algorithms in various settings.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03480v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Hebbian Plasticity for Improving Perceptual Decisions', ['Tsung-Ren Huang'], u'2016-12-10', u'Shibata et al. reported that humans could learn to repeatedly evoke a stimulus-associated functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity pattern in visual areas V1/V2 through which visual perceptual learning was achieved without stimulus presentation. Contrary to their attribution of visual improvements to neuroplasticity in adult V1/V2, our Hebbian learning interpretation of these data explains the attainment of better perceptual decisions without plastic V1/V2.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03270v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Evolutionary Dynamics of Group Formation', ['Marco Alberto Javarone', 'Daniele Marinazzo'], u'2016-12-12', u"We introduce a model, based on the Evolutionary Game Theory, for studying the dynamics of group formation. The latter constitutes a relevant phenomenon observed in different animal species, whose individuals tend to cluster together forming groups of different size. Results of previous investigations suggest that this phenomenon might have similar reasons across different species, such as improving the individual safety (e.g. from predators), and increasing the probability to get food resources. Remarkably, the group size might strongly vary from species to species, and sometimes even within the same species. In the proposed model, an agent population tries to form homogeneous groups. The homogeneity of a group is computed according to a spin vector, that characterizes each agent, and represents a set a features (e.g. physical traits). We analyze the formation of groups of different size, on varying a parameter named 'individual payoff'. The latter represents the gain one agent would receive acting individually. In particular, the agents choose whether to form a group (receiving a 'group payoff'), or if to play individually (receiving an 'individual payoff'). The phase diagram representing the equilibria of our population shows a sharp transition between the 'group phase' and the 'individual phase', in correspondence of a critical 'individual payoff'. In addition, we found that forming (homogeneous) small groups is easier than forming big groups. To conclude, we deem that our model and the related results supports the hypothesis that the phenomenon of group formation has evolutionary roots.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03834v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Darwinian Selection Induces Lamarckian Adaptation in a Holobiont Model', ['Dino Osmanovic', 'David A Kessler', 'Yitzhak Rabin', 'Yoav Soen'], u'2016-12-12', u'Current models of animal evolution focus on selection of individuals, ignoring the much faster selection of symbiotic bacteria. Here we take host-symbiont interactions into account by introducing a Population Genetics-like model of holobionts exposed to toxic stress. The stress can be alleviated by selection of resistant individuals (host and bacteria) and by secretion of a detoxification agent ("detox"). By defining a new measure, termed the Lamarckian, we show that selection of resistant bacteria over one generation of hosts leads to stress-dependent increase in the tolerance of the host\'s offspring. This benefit is mediated by co-alleviation of toxic and physiologic stress. Prolonged exposure leads to further adaptation by \'group selection\' of bacterial communities with higher detox per bacterium. These findings show that Lamarckian adaptation can arise via interactions between two levels of Darwinian selection within a holobiont system. The conclusions and modelling framework are applicable to diverse types of holobiont systems.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03567v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Modeling the spread of the Zika virus using topological data analysis', ['Derek Lo', 'Briton Park'], u'2016-12-12', u"The Zika virus (ZIKV), a vector-borne disease, was declared a global health emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO) in early 2016. The Aedes aegypti mosquito is the primary transmission vector for ZIKV, and approximately 2.6 billion people live in regions suitable for the virus to spread. A ZIKV outbreak began in Brazil in 2015 and has spread all throughout South America due to the abundance of the mosquito species. ZIKV has been associated with serious conditions such as microcephaly and Guillain-Barr\\'e Syndrome, making it imperative for epidemiologists to model the spread of the disease to better manage it. Traditional predictive models for vector-borne diseases use common state-level attributes such as population density and temperature to determine the spread of the disease. However, these models make no use of the spatial information specific to the disease. By applying techniques from topological data analysis, we considerably improve these existing models and determine with greater predictive power how ZIKV will spread. We use the Vietoris-Rips filtration on the locations of the mosquitoes in Brazil to create simplicial complexes, from which we extract homology group generators. Previously epidemiologists have not relied on topological data analysis to model disease spread. A statistical comparison of these topological features to more standard measures demonstrates the value of these techniques for the improved assessment of vector-borne diseases.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03554v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

McCaw'], u'2016-12-12', u"Despite a low global prevalence, infections with Sarcoptes scabiei, or scabies, are still common in remote communities such as in northern Australia and the Solomon Islands. Mass drug administration (MDA) has been utilised in these communities, and although prevalence drops substantially initially, these reductions have not been sustained. We develop a compartmental model of scabies infection dynamics and incorporate both ovicidal and non-ovicidal treatment regimes. By including the dynamics of mass drug administration, we are able to reproduce the phenomena of an initial reduction in prevalence, followed by the recrudescence of infection levels in the population. We show that even under a `perfect' two-round MDA, eradication of scabies under a non-ovicidal treatment scheme is almost impossible. We then go on to consider how the probability of elimination varies with the number of treatment rounds delivered in an MDA. We find that even with infeasibly large numbers of treatment rounds, elimination remains challenging.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03541v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

Schilling', 'Vyacheslav Gorshkov', 'Sergiy Libert', 'Vladimir Privman'], u'2016-12-12', u'We develop a theoretical approach that uses physiochemical kinetics modelling to describe cell population dynamics upon progression of viral infection in cell culture, which results in cell apoptosis (programmed cell death) and necrosis (direct cell death). Several model parameters necessary for computer simulation were determined by reviewing and analyzing available published experimental data. By comparing experimental data to computer modelling results, we identify the parameters that are the most sensitive to the measured system properties and allow for the best data fitting. Our model allows extraction of parameters from experimental data and also has predictive power. Using the model we describe interesting time-dependent quantities that were not directly measured in the experiment, and identify correlations among the fitted parameter values. Numerical simulation of viral infection progression is done by a rate-equation approach resulting in a system of "stiff" equations, which are solved by using a novel variant of the stochastic ensemble modelling approach. The latter was originally developed for coupled chemical reactions.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03828v1', ['Quantitative Methods', 'Cell Behavior'], []]

In this spirit we show that a tool from community ecology, the Rank Abundance Distribution (RAD), can be turned by the new MaxRank normalization method into a generic, expressive descriptor for quantitative comparison of communities in many areas of biology. To illustrate the versatility of the method, we analyze RADs from various \\emph{generalized communities}, i.e.\\ assemblages of genetically diverse cells or organisms, including human B cells, gut microbiomes under antibiotic treatment and of different ages and countries of origin, and other human and environmental microbial communities. We show that normalized RADs enable novel quantitative approaches that help to understand structures and dynamics of complex generalize communities.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03692v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Mechanisms of stochastic onset and termination of atrial fibrillation episodes: Insights using a cellular automaton model', ['Yen Ting Lin', 'Eugene TY Chang', 'Julie Eatock', 'Tobias Galla', 'Richard H Clayton'], u'2016-12-11', u'Mathematical models of cardiac electrical excitation are increasingly complex, with multiscale models seeking to represent and bridge physiological behaviours across temporal and spatial scales. The increasing complexity of these models makes it computationally expensive to both evaluate long term (>60 seconds) behaviour and determine sensitivity of model outputs to inputs. This is particularly relevant in models of atrial fibrillation (AF), where individual episodes last from seconds to days, and inter-episode waiting times can be minutes to months. Potential mechanisms of transition between sinus rhythm and AF have been identified but are not well understood, and it is difficult to simulate AF for long periods of time using state-of-the-art models. In this study, we implemented a Moe-type cellular automaton on a novel, topologically correct surface geometry of the left atrium. We used the model to simulate stochastic initiation and spontaneous termination of AF, arising from bursts of spontaneous activation near pulmonary veins. The simplified representation of atrial electrical activity reduced computational cost, and so permitted us to investigate AF mechanisms in a probabilistic setting. We computed large numbers (~10^5) of sample paths of the model, to infer stochastic initiation and termination rates of AF episodes using different model parameters. By generating statistical distributions of model outputs, we demonstrated how to propagate uncertainties of inputs within our microscopic level model up to a macroscopic level. Lastly, we investigated spontaneous termination in the model and found a complex dependence on its past AF trajectory, the mechanism of which merits future investigation.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03403v1', ['Quantitative Methods', 'Tissues and Organs'], []]

In this article we propose a mathematical formulation of this problem, in terms of partial differential equations. This allows us to detail two algorithms: one for localizing a target using the multi-frequency aspect of the signal, and antoher one for identifying the shape of this target. Shape recognition is designed in a machine learning point of view, and take advantage of both the multi-frequency setup and the movement of the fish around its prey. Numerical simulations are shown for the computation of the electric field emitted and sensed by the fish; they are then used as an input for the two algorithms.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03168v1', ['Tissues and Organs'], []]
[u'Modeling the Effect of Blunt Impact on Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Cartilage', ['Georgi I. Kapitanov', 'Bruce P. Ayati', 'James A.

The hypothesis that the injurious impact causes irreversible damage to chondrocyte mitochondria, which in turn increase their production of free radicals, affecting their energy production and their ability to rebuild the extracellular matrix, has to be modeled and the processes quantified in order to further the understanding of OA, its causes, and viable treatment options. The current article presents a calibrated model that captures the damage oxidative stress incurs on the cell viability, ATP production, and cartilage stability in a cartilage explant after a drop-tower impact. The model validates the biological hypothesis and will be used in further efforts to identify possibilities for treatment and be a part of a bigger modeling & simulation framework for the development of OA.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03859v1', ['Cell Behavior'], []]
