[u'Constructing backbone network by using tinker algorithm', ['Zhiwei He', 'Meng Zhan', 'Jianxiong Wang', 'Chenggui Yao'], u'2016-12-17', u'Revealing how a biological network is organized to realize its function is one of the main topics in systems biology. The functional backbone network, defined as the primary structure of the biological network, is of great importance in maintaining the main function of the biological network. We propose a new algorithm, the tinker algorithm, to determine this core structure and apply it in the cell-cycle system. With this algorithm, the backbone network of the cell-cycle network can be determined accurately and efficiently in various models such as the Boolean model, stochastic model, and ordinary differential equation model. Results show that our algorithm is more efficient than that used in the previous research. We hope this method can be put into practical use in relevant future studies.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05749v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
[u'New Insights into the Dynamics of Swarming Bacteria: A Theoretical Study', ['David Hansmann', 'Guido Fier', 'Ruben Carlos Buceta'], u'2016-12-19', u'In the present work we simulate the basic two-dimensional dynamics of swarming E. coli bacteria on the surface of a moderately soft agar plate. Individual bacteria are modelled by self-propelled ridged bodies (agents), which interact with each other only through inelastic collision and with the highly viscous environment through damping forces. The motion of single agents is modelled closely corresponding to the behaviour of swimming bacteria. The dynamics of the model were adjusted to reproduce the experimental measurements of swimming E. coli K 12. Accordingly, simulations with loosely packed agents (p=0) show typical run-and-tumble statistics. In contrast, simulations with densely packed agents (p=0.3-0.7) are dominated by interactions (collisions) between agents which lead to the emergence of swarming behaviour. In addition, we model the motion of single agents on the base of modified run-and-tumble dynamics, where the bacteria do not turn actively during the tumble. We show that simulations with densely packed modified agents lead as well the emergence of swarming behaviour, if rotational diffusion is considered.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.06267v1', ['Cell Behavior'], []]
