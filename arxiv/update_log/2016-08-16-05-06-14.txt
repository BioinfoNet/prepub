[u'PB-AM: An Open-Source, Fully Analytical Linear Poisson-Boltzmann Solver', ['Lisa E. Feldberg', 'David H. Brookes', 'Eng-Hui Yap', 'Elizabeth Jurrus', 'Nathan Baker', 'Teresa Head-Gordon'], u'2016-08-14', u'We present the open source distributed software package Poisson-Boltzmann\nAnalytical Method (PB-AM), a fully analytical solution to the linearized\nPoisson Boltzmann equation. The PB-AM software package includes the generation\nof outputs files appropriate for visualization using VMD, a Brownian dynamics\nscheme that uses periodic boundary conditions to simulate dynamics, the ability\nto specify docking criteria, and offers two different kinetics schemes to\nevaluate biomolecular association rate constants. Given that PB-AM defines\nmutual polarization completely and accurately, it can be refactored as a\nmany-body expansion to explore 2- and 3-body polarization. Additionally, the\nsoftware has been integrated into the Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver (APBS)\nsoftware package to make it more accessible to a larger group of scientists,\neducators and students that are more familiar with the APBS framework.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04054v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Mean field analysis of large-scale interacting populations of stochastic\n  conductance-based spiking neurons using the Klimontovich method', ['Daniel Gandolfo', 'Roger Rodriguez', 'Henry C. Tuckwell'], u'2016-08-14', u'We investigate the dynamics of large-scale interacting neural populations,\ncomposed of conductance based, spiking model neurons with modifiable synaptic\nconnection strengths, which are possibly also subjected to external noisy\ncurrents. The network dynamics is controlled by a set of neural population\nprobability distributions ($\\mathrm{PPD}$)which are constructed along the same\nlines as in the Klimontovich approach to the kinetic theory of plasmas. An\nexact non-closed, nonlinear, system of integro-partial differential equations\nis derived for the $\\mathrm{PPD}$s. As is customary, a closing procedure leads\nto a mean field limit. The equations we have obtained are of the same type as\nthose which have been recently derived using rigorous techniques of probability\ntheory. The numerical solutions of these so called McKean-Vlasov-Fokker-Planck\nequations, which are only valid in the limit of infinite size networks,\nactually shows that the statistical measures as obtained from $\\mathrm{PPD}$s\nare in good agreement with those obtained through direct integration of the\nstochastic dynamical system for large but finite size networks. Although\nnumerical solutions have been obtained in the case of Fitzhugh-Nagumo model\nneurons, the theory can be readily applied to systems of Hodgkin-Huxley type\nmodel neurons of arbitrary dimension.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04098v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Nonlinear Statistical Data Assimilation for HVC RA Neurons in the Avian\n  Song System', ['Nirag Kadakia', 'Eve Armstrong', 'Daniel Breen', 'Uriel Morone', 'Arij Daou', 'Daniel Margoliash', 'Henry DI Abarbanel'], u'2016-08-13', u'With the goal of building a model of the HVC nucleus in the avian song\nsystem, we discuss in detail a model of HVC\\textsubscript{RA} projection\nneurons comprised of a somatic compartment with fast Na$^+$ and K$^+$ currents\nand a dendritic compartment with slower Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics. We show this model\nqualitatively exhibits many observed electrophysiological behaviors. We then\nshow in numerical procedures how one can design and analyze feasible laboratory\nexperiments that allow the estimation of all of the many parameters and\nunmeasured dynamical variables, give observations of the somatic voltage\n$V_s(t)$ alone. A key to this procedure is to initially estimate the slow\ndynamics associated with Ca, blocking the fast Na and K variations, and then\nwith the Ca parameters fixed, estimate the fast Na and K dynamics. This\nseparation of time scales provides a numerically robust method for completing\nthe full neuron model, and the efficacy of the method is tested by prediction\nwhen observations are complete. The simulation provides a framework for the\nslice preparation experiments and illustrates the use of data assimilation\nmethods for the design of those experiments.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04005v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

[u'Cultural Evolution as a Non-Stationary Stochastic Process', ['Arwen E. Nicholson', 'Paolo Sibani'], u'2016-08-15', u"We present an individual based model of cultural evolution, where interacting\nagents are coded by binary strings standing for strategies for action,\nblueprints for products or attitudes and beliefs. The model is patterned on an\nestablished model of biological evolution, the Tangled Nature Model (TNM),\nwhere a `tangle' of interactions between agents determines their reproductive\nsuccess. In addition, our agents also have the ability to copy part of each\nother's strategy, a feature inspired by the Axelrod model of cultural\ndiversity. Unlike the latter, but similarly to the TNM, the model dynamics goes\nthrough a series of metastable stages of increasing length, each characterized\nby mutually enforcing cultural patterns. These patterns are abruptly replaced\nby other patterns characteristic of the next metastable period. We analyze the\ntime dependence of the population and diversity in the system, show how\ndifferent cultures are formed and merge, and how their survival probability\nlacks, in the model, a finite average life-time. Finally, we use historical\ndata on the number of car manufacturers after the introduction of the\nautomobile to the market, to argue that ourmodel can qualitatively reproduce\nthe flurry of cultural activity which follows a disruptive innovation.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04203v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

[u'Impact of asymptomatic infection on coupled disease-behavior dynamics in\n  complex networks', ['Hai-Feng Zhang', 'Jia-Rong Xie', 'Han-Shuang Chen', 'Can Liu', 'Michael Small'], u'2016-08-14', u'Studies on how to model the interplay between diseases and behavioral\nresponses (so-called coupled disease-behavior interaction) have attracted\nincreasing attention. Owing to the lack of obvious clinical evidence of\ndiseases, or the incomplete information related to the disease, the risks of\ninfection cannot be perceived and may lead to inappropriate behavioral\nresponses. Therefore, how to quantitatively analyze the impacts of asymptomatic\ninfection on the interplay between diseases and behavioral responses is of\nparticular importance. In this Letter, under the complex network framework, we\nstudy the coupled disease-behavior interaction model by dividing infectious\nindividuals into two states: U-state (without evident clinical symptoms,\nlabelled as U) and I-state (with evident clinical symptoms, labelled as I). A\nsusceptible individual can be infected by U- or I-nodes, however, since the\nU-nodes cannot be easily observed, susceptible individuals take behavioral\nresponses \\emph{only} when they contact I-nodes. The mechanism is considered in\nthe improved Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model and the improved\nSusceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model, respectively. Then, one of the most\nconcerned problems in spreading dynamics: the epidemic thresholds for the two\nmodels are given by two methods. The analytic results \\emph{quantitatively}\ndescribe the influence of different factors, such as asymptomatic infection,\nthe awareness rate, the network structure, and so forth, on the epidemic\nthresholds. Moreover, because of the irreversible process of the SIR model, the\nsuppression effect of the improved SIR model is weaker than the improved SIS\nmodel.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04049v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Surrogacy of progression free survival for overall survival in\n  metastatic breast cancer studies: meta-analyses of published studies', ['Madan G. Kundu', 'Suddhasatta Acharyya'], u'2016-08-15', u'Purpose: PFS is often used as a surrogate endpoint for OS in metastatic\nbreast cancer studies. We have evaluated the association of treatment effect on\nPFS with significant HR$_{OS}$ (and how this association is affected by other\nfactors) in published prospective metastatic breast cancer studies.\n  Methods: A systematic literature search in PubMed identified prospective\nmetastatic breast cancer studies. Treatments effects on PFS were determined\nusing hazard ratio (HR$_{PFS}$), increase in median PFS ($\\Delta$MED$_{PFS}$)\nand % increase in median PFS (%$\\Delta$MED$_{PFS}$). Diagnostic accuracy of PFS\nmeasures (HR$_{PFS}$, $\\Delta$MED$_{PFS}$ and %$\\Delta$MED$_{PFS}$) in\npredicting significant HR$_{OS}$ was assessed using receiver operating\ncharacteristics (ROC) curves and classification trees approach.\n  Results: Seventy-three cases (i.e., treatment to control comparisons) from 64\nindividual publications were identified for the analyses. Of these, 16 cases\nreported significant treatment effect on HR$_{OS}$ at 5% level of significance.\nMedian number of deaths reported in these cases were 156. Area under the ROC\ncurve (AUC) for diagnostic measures as HR$_{PFS}$, $\\Delta$MED$_{PFS}$ and\n%$\\Delta$MED$_{PFS}$ were 0.69, 0.70 and 0.75, respectively. Classification\ntree results identified %$\\Delta$MED$_{PFS}$ and number of deaths as diagnostic\nmeasure for significant HR$_{OS}$. Only 7.9% (3/38) cases with\n$\\Delta$MED$_{PFS}$ shorter than 48.27% reported significant HR$_{OS}$. There\nwere 5 cases with $\\Delta$MED$_{PFS}$ greater than 98.69% and number of deaths\nreported as 227 or more -- all of these 5 cases reported significant HR$_{OS}$.\n  Conclusion: %$\\Delta$MED$_{PFS}$ was found as better diagnostic measure for\nsignificant HR$_{OS}$. Our analysis results also suggest that consideration of\ntotal number of deaths may further improve its diagnostic performance.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04300v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]

[u'Scout-It: Interior tomography using modified scout acquisition', ['Kriti Sen Sharma'], u'2016-08-14', u'Global scout views have been previously used to reduce interior\nreconstruction artifacts in high-resolution micro-CT and C-arm systems. However\nthese methods cannot be directly used in the all-important domain of clinical\nCT. This is because when the CT scan is truncated, the scout views are also\ntruncated. However many cases of truncation in clinical CT involve partial\ntruncation, where the anterio-posterior (AP) scout is truncated, but the\nmedio-lateral (ML) scout is non-truncated. In this paper, we show that in such\ncases of partially truncated CT scans, a modified configuration may be used to\nacquire non-truncated AP scout view, and ultimately allow for highly accurate\ninterior reconstruction.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04059v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Evaluation of a New Vasculature by High Resolution Light Microscopy:\n  Primo Vessel and Node', ['Vitaly Vodyanoy', 'Oleg Pustovyy', 'Ludmila Globa', 'Iryna Sorokulova'], u'2016-08-15', u'The primo vascular system is composed of nodes and vessels. The bundle of\nsub-vessels of the promo vessel is laid into an external jacket composed of\nendothelial cells. The node is heterogeneous in nature, composed of twisted\nsub-vessel bundles that fill up nearly the entire node volume. The enlarged\nsub-vessel inside the node harbors microcells that express stem cells and stem\ncells niche markers. We conclude that these microcells are progenitors of\nmultipotent stem cells and the nodes serve as the stem cell niches outside the\nbone marrow.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04276v1', ['Tissues and Organs'], []]
[u'Identifying parameter regions for multistationarity', ['Carsten Conradi', 'Elisenda Feliu', 'Maya Mincheva', 'Carsten Wiuf'], u'2016-08-13', u'Mathematical modeling has become an established tool for studying biological\ndynamics. Current applications range from building models that reproduce\nquantitative data to identifying models with predefined qualitative features,\nsuch as switching behavior, bistability or oscillations. Mathematically, the\nlatter question amounts to identifying parameter values associated with a given\nqualitative feature.\n  We introduce an algorithm to partition the parameter space of a parameterized\nsystem of ordinary differential equations into regions for which the system has\na unique or multiple equilibria. The algorithm is based on a simple idea, the\ncomputation of the Brouwer degree, and creates a multivariate polynomial with\nparameter depending coefficients. Using algebraic techniques, the signs of the\ncoefficients reveal parameter regions with and without multistationarity.\n  We demonstrate the algorithm on models of gene transcription and cell\nsignaling, and argue that the parameter constraints defining each region have\nbiological meaningful interpretations.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03993v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
[u'BNP-Seq: Bayesian Nonparametric Differential Expression Analysis of\n  Sequencing Count Data', ['Siamak Zamani Dadaneh', 'Xiaoning Qian', 'Mingyuan Zhou'], u'2016-08-13', u'We perform differential expression analysis of high-throughput sequencing\ncount data under a Bayesian nonparametric framework, removing sophisticated\nad-hoc pre-processing steps commonly required in existing algorithms. We\npropose to use the gamma (beta) negative binomial process, which takes into\naccount different sequencing depths using sample-specific negative binomial\nprobability (dispersion) parameters, to detect differentially expressed genes\nby comparing the posterior distributions of gene-specific negative binomial\ndispersion (probability) parameters. These model parameters are inferred by\nborrowing statistical strength across both the genes and samples.
