[u'How wet should be the reaction coordinate for ligand unbinding?', ['Pratyush Tiwary', 'B. J.

Sci 2016, 113, 2839\n(2016)), to determine an optimal 1-dimensional reaction coordinate (RC) for the\nunbinding of a bucky-ball from a pocket in explicit water. This RC is estimated\nas a linear combination of the multiple available order parameters that\ncollectively can be used to distinguish the various stable states relevant for\nunbinding. We pay special attention to determining and quantifying the degree\nto which water molecules should be included in the RC. Using SGOOP with\nunder-sampled biased simulations, we predict that water plays a distinct role\nin the reaction coordinate for unbinding in the case when the ligand is\nsterically constrained to move along an axis of symmetry. This prediction is\nvalidated through extensive calculations of the unbinding times through\nmetadynamics, and by comparison through detailed balance with unbiased\nmolecular dynamics estimate of the binding time. However when the steric\nconstraint is removed, we find that the role of water in the reaction\ncoordinate diminishes. Here instead SGOOP identifies a good one-dimensional RC\ninvolving various motional degrees of freedom.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07090v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]

This suggests that\nbiological and artificial neural networks share a fundamental organising\nprinciple. We shed light on this principle in the framework of optimal coding.\nSpecifically, we first investigate which properties of a code render it robust\nto transmission over noisy channels and formally prove that for equientropic\nchannels an upper bound on the expected minimum decoding error is attained for\ncodes with maximum marginal entropy. We then show that the pairwise correlation\nof units in a deep layer of a neural network, that has been trained on an\nobject recognition task, increases when perturbing the distribution of input\nimages, i. e., that the network exhibits properties of an optimally coding\nsystem. By analogy, this suggests that the layer-wise similarity of feature\nrepresentations in biological and artificial neural networks is a result of\noptimal coding that enables robust transmission of object information over\nnoisy channels. Because we find that in equientropic channels the upper bound\non the expected minimum decoding error is independent of the class-conditional\nentropy, our work further provides a plausible explanation why optimal codes\ncan be learned in unsupervised settings.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07094v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

[u'Inference by Reparameterization in Neural Population Codes', ['Rajkumar Vasudeva Raju', 'Xaq Pitkow'], u'2016-05-20', u'Behavioral experiments on humans and animals suggest that the brain performs\nprobabilistic inference to interpret its environment. Here we present a new\ngeneral-purpose, biologically-plausible neural implementation of approximate\ninference. The neural network represents uncertainty using Probabilistic\nPopulation Codes (PPCs), which are distributed neural representations that\nnaturally encode probability distributions, and support marginalization and\nevidence integration in a biologically-plausible manner. By connecting multiple\nPPCs together as a probabilistic graphical model, we represent multivariate\nprobability distributions. Approximate inference in graphical models can be\naccomplished by message-passing algorithms that disseminate local information\nthroughout the graph. An attractive and often accurate example of such an\nalgorithm is Loopy Belief Propagation (LBP), which uses local marginalization\nand evidence integration operations to perform approximate inference\nefficiently even for complex models. Unfortunately, a subtle feature of LBP\nrenders it neurally implausible. However, LBP can be elegantly reformulated as\na sequence of Tree-based Reparameterizations (TRP) of the graphical model. We\nre-express the TRP updates as a nonlinear dynamical system with both fast and\nslow timescales, and show that this produces a neurally plausible solution. By\ncombining all of these ideas, we show that a network of PPCs can represent\nmultivariate probability distributions and implement the TRP updates to perform\nprobabilistic inference. Simulations with Gaussian graphical models demonstrate\nthat the neural network inference quality is comparable to the direct\nevaluation of LBP and robust to noise, and thus provides a promising mechanism\nfor general probabilistic inference in the population codes of the brain.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06544v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

Based on principles from\ninformation theory, we have previously developed a new population genetic\nmodel, and applying it in simulations, we have recently hypothesized that all\nspecies maintain the maximum genomic complexity that is required by their niche\nand allowed by their mutation rate and selection intensity. Applying this idea\nto the complexity overhead of recombination maintenance, its costs must be more\nthan compensated by an additional capacity for complexity in recombining\npopulations. Here, we show a simple mechanism, where recombination helps to\nmaintain larger biases of alleles frequencies in a population, so the\nadvantageous alleles can have increased frequency. This allows recombining\npopulations to maintain higher fitness and phenotypic efficiency in comparison\nwith asexual populations with the same parameters. Random mating alone already\nsignificantly increases the ability to maintain genomic and phenotypic\ncomplexity. Sexual selection provides additional capacity for this complexity.\nThe model can be considered as a unifying synthesis of previous hypotheses\nabout the roles of recombination in Muller's ratchet, mutation purging and Red\nQueen dynamics, because the introduction of recombination both increases\npopulation frequencies of beneficial alleles and decreases detrimental ones. In\naddition, we suggest simple explanations for niche-dependent prevalence of\ntransient asexuality and the exceptional asexual lineage of Bdelloid rotifers.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07052v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

These differences may yield different predictions and parameter\nestimates from the same data. Given the increasing use of models to inform\npublic health decision-making, it is important to assess distinguishability\n(whether models can be distinguished based on fit to data) and inference\nrobustness (whether model inferences are robust to realistic variations in\nmodel structure). We examined the effects of uncertainty in model structure in\nepidemic cholera, testing a range of models based on known features of cholera\nepidemiology. We fit to simulated epidemic and long-term data, as well as data\nfrom the 2006 Angola epidemic. We evaluated model distinguishability based on\ndata fit, and whether parameter values and forecasts can accurately be inferred\nfrom incidence data. In general, all models were able to successfully fit to\nall data sets, even if misspecified. However, in the long-term data, the best\nmodel fits were achieved when the loss of immunity form matched those of the\nmodel that simulated the data. Two transmission and reporting parameters were\naccurately estimated across all models, while the remaining showed broad\nvariation across the different models and data sets.

As a result,\nthe mRNA copy number of a given gene is heterogeneous both between cells and\nacross time. We present a framework to model gene transcription in populations\nof cells with time-varying (stochastic or deterministic) transcription and\ndegradation rates.

During metaphase in the early C.\nelegans embryo, the spindle is aligned and centered on the anterior-posterior\naxis by a microtubule-dependent machinery that exerts restoring forces when the\nspindle is displaced from the center. To investigate the accuracy and stability\nof centering, we tracked the position and orientation of the mitotic spindle\nduring the first cell division with high temporal and spatial resolution. We\nfound that the precision is remarkably high: the cell-to-cell variation in the\ntransverse position of the center of the spindle during metaphase, as measured\nby the standard deviation, was only 1.5% of the length of the short axis of the\ncell. Spindle position is also very stable: the standard deviation of the\nfluctuations in transverse spindle position during metaphase was only 0.5% of\nthe short axis of the cell. Assuming that stability is limited by number\nfluctuations, we infer that the centering machinery has a large number of\nindependent force generating units, on the order of one thousand, consistent\nwith the several thousand of astral microtubules in these cells. Astral\nmicrotubules grow out from the two spindle poles, contact and push against the\ncell cortex, and then shrink back shortly thereafter. The high stability of\ncentering can be accounted for quantitatively if the astral microtubules buckle\nas they exert compressive, pushing forces onto the cortex. We thus propose that\nthe large number of microtubules in the asters provides a highly precise\nmechanism for positioning the spindle while its assembly is completed during\nmetaphase prior to the onset of anaphase.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07053v1', ['Quantitative Methods', 'Subcellular Processes'], []]
