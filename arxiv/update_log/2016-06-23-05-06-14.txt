[u'Statistics of topological RNA structures', ['Thomas J. X. Li', 'Christian M. Reidys'], u'2016-06-22', u'In this paper we study properties of topological RNA structures, i.e.~RNA\ncontact structures with cross-serial interactions that are filtered by their\ntopological genus. RNA secondary structures within this framework are\ntopological structures having genus zero. We derive a new bivariate generating\nfunction whose singular expansion allows us to analyze the distributions of\narcs, stacks, hairpin- , interior- and multi-loops. We then extend this\nanalysis to H-type pseudoknots, kissing hairpins as well as $3$-knots and\ncompute their respective expectation values. Finally we discuss our results and\nput them into context with data obtained by uniform sampling structures of\nfixed genus.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06956v1', ['Biomolecules', 'Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Sparse convolutional coding for neuronal ensemble identification', ['Sven Peter', 'Daniel Durstewitz', 'Ferran Diego', 'Fred A. Hamprecht'], u'2016-06-22', u'Cell ensembles, originally proposed by Donald Hebb in 1949, are subsets of\nsynchronously firing neurons and proposed to explain basic firing behavior in\nthe brain. Despite having been studied for many years no conclusive evidence\nhas been presented yet for their existence and involvement in information\nprocessing such that their identification is still a topic of modern research,\nespecially since simultaneous recordings of large neuronal population have\nbecome possible in the past three decades. These large recordings pose a\nchallenge for methods allowing to identify individual neurons forming cell\nensembles and their time course of activity inside the vast amounts of spikes\nrecorded. Related work so far focused on the identification of purely simulta-\nneously firing neurons using techniques such as Principal Component Analysis.\nIn this paper we propose a new algorithm based on sparse convolution coding\nwhich is also able to find ensembles with temporal structure. Application of\nour algorithm to synthetically generated datasets shows that it outperforms\nprevious work and is able to accurately identify temporal cell ensembles even\nwhen those contain overlapping neurons or when strong background noise is\npresent.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07029v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Online games: a novel approach to explore how partial information\n  influences random search processes', ['Ricardo Martinez-Garcia', 'Justin M. Calabrese', 'Cristobal Lopez'], u'2016-06-22', u'Many natural processes rely on optimizing the success ratio of an underlying\nsearch process. We investigate how fluxes of information between individuals\nand their environment modify the statistical properties of human search\nstrategies. Using an online game, searchers have to find a hidden target whose\nlocation is hinted by a surrounding neighborhood. Searches are optimal for\nintermediate neighborhood sizes; smaller areas are harder to locate while\nlarger ones obscure the location of the target inside it. Although the\nneighborhood size that minimizes average search times depends on neighborhood\ngeometry, we develop a theoretical framework to predict this value in a general\nsetup. Furthermore, a priori access to information about the landscape turns\nsearch strategies into self-adaptive processes in which the trajectory on the\nboard evolves to show a well-defined characteristic jumping length. A family of\nrandom-walk models is developed to investigate the non-Markovian nature of the\nprocess.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06850v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Autoantibody recognition mechanisms of MUC1', ['J. C. Phillips'], u'2016-06-21', u'The most cost-effective blood-based, noninvasive molecular cancer biomarkers\nare based on p53 epitopes and MUC1 tandem repeats. Here we use dimensionally\ncompressed bioinformatic fractal scaling analysis to compare the two distinct\nand comparable probes, which examine different sections of the autoantibody\npopulation, achieving combined sensitivities of order 50%. We discover a\npromising MUC1 epitope in the SEA region outside the tandem repeats.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07024v1', ['Other'], []]
[u'Effects of initial telomere length distribution on senescence onset and\n  heterogeneity', ['Sarah Eugene', 'Thibault Bourgeron', 'Zhou Xu'], u'2016-06-22', u'Replicative senescence, induced by telomere shortening, exhibits considerable\nasynchrony and heterogeneity, the origins of which remain unclear. Here, we\nformally study how telomere shortening mechanisms impact on senescence kinetics\nand define two regimes of senescence, depending on the initial telomere length\nvariance. We provide analytical solutions to the model, highlighting a\nnon-linear relationship between senescence onset and initial telomere length\ndistribution. This study reveals the complexity of the collective behavior of\ntelomeres as they shorten, leading to senescence heterogeneity.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06842v1', ['Subcellular Processes', 'Genomics'], []]
