[u'Grid-like structure is optimal for path integration', ['Reza Moazzezi'], u'2016-06-03', u'Grid cells in medial entorhinal cortex are believed to play a key role in\npath integration. However, the relation between path integration and the\ngrid-like arrangement of their firing field remains unclear. We provide\ntheoretical evidence that grid-like structure and path integration are closely\nrelated. In one dimension, the grid-like structure provides the optimal\nsolution for path integration assuming that the noise correlation structure is\nGaussian. In two dimensions, assuming that the noise is Gaussian, rectangular\ngrid-like structure is the optimal solution provided that 1- both noise\ncorrelation and receptive field structures of the neurons can be\nmultiplicatively decomposed into orthogonal components and 2- the eigenvalues\nof the decomposed correlation matrices decrease faster than the square of the\nfrequency of the corresponding eigenvectors. We will also address the decoding\nmechanism and show that the problem of decoding reduces to the problem of\nextracting task relevant information in the presence of task irrelevant\ninformation. Change-based Population Coding provides the optimal solution for\nthis problem.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01239v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Dense Associative Memory for Pattern Recognition', ['Dmitry Krotov', 'John J Hopfield'], u'2016-06-03', u'A model of associative memory is studied, which stores and reliably retrieves\nmany more patterns than the number of neurons in the network. We propose a\nsimple duality between this dense associative memory and neural networks\ncommonly used in deep learning. On the associative memory side of this duality,\na family of models that smoothly interpolates between two limiting cases can be\nconstructed. One limit is referred to as the feature-matching mode of pattern\nrecognition, and the other one as the prototype regime. On the deep learning\nside of the duality, this family corresponds to feedforward neural networks\nwith one hidden layer and various activation functions, which transmit the\nactivities of the visible neurons to the hidden layer. This family of\nactivation functions includes logistics, rectified linear units, and rectified\npolynomials of higher degrees. The proposed duality makes it possible to apply\nenergy-based intuition from associative memory to analyze computational\nproperties of neural networks with unusual activation functions - the higher\nrectified polynomials which until now have not been used for training neural\nnetworks. The utility of the dense memories is illustrated for two test cases:\nthe logical gate XOR and the recognition of handwritten digits from the MNIST\ndata set.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01164v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Combining EEG source connectivity and network similarity: Application to\n  object categorization in the human brain', ['Ahmad Mheich', 'Mahmoud Hassan', 'Olivier Dufor', 'Mohamad Khalil', 'Fabrice Wendling'], u'2016-06-03', u'A major challenge in cognitive neuroscience is to evaluate the ability of the\nhuman brain to categorize or group visual stimuli based on common features.\nThis categorization process is very fast and occurs in few hundreds of\nmillisecond time scale. However, an accurate tracking of the spatiotemporal\ndynamics of large-scale brain networks is still an unsolved issue. Here, we\nshow the combination of recently developed method called dense-EEG source\nconnectivity to identify functional brain networks with excellent temporal and\nspatial resolutions and an algorithm, called SimNet, to compute brain networks\nsimilarity. Two categories of visual stimuli were analysed in this study:\nimmobile and mobile. Networks similarity was assessed within each category\n(intra-condition) and between categories (inter-condition). Results showed high\nsimilarity within each category and low similarity between the two categories.\nA significant difference between similarities computed in the intra and\ninter-conditions was observed at the period of 120-190ms supposed to be related\nto visual recognition and memory access. We speculate that these observations\nwill be very helpful toward understanding the object categorization in the\nhuman brain from a network perspective.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01017v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Control of the Extension-Flexion Cycle of Human Knees During Bicycle\n  Riding by a Synergy of Solitary Muscular Excitations and Contractions', ['Zoran Gojkovic', 'Tijana Ivancevic'], u'2016-06-03', u'A Hill-type model is proposed for the extension-flexion cycle of human knees\nduring bicycle riding. The extension-flexion cycle is controlled by a synergy\nof muscular excitations and contractions of the knee musculature. Muscular\naction potentials are modeled by Sine-Gordon kinks, while titin-influenced\nactomyosin contractionsare modeled by Korteweg-de Vries solitons. As an\napplication, the total knee arthroplasty is discussed.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00965v1', ['Quantitative Methods', 'Tissues and Organs'], []]
[u'Multi-Organ Cancer Classification and Survival Analysis', ['Stefan Bauer', 'Nicolas Carion', 'Peter Schuffler', 'Thomas Fuchs', 'Peter Wild', 'Joachim M. Buhmann'], u'2016-06-02', u'Accurate and robust cell nuclei classification is the cornerstone for a wider\nrange of tasks in digital and Computational Pathology. However, most machine\nlearning systems require extensive labeling from expert pathologists for each\nindividual problem at hand, with no or limited abilities for knowledge transfer\nbetween datasets and organ sites. In this paper we implement and evaluate a\nvariety of deep neural network models and model ensembles for nuclei\nclassification in renal cell cancer (RCC) and prostate cancer (PCa). We propose\na convolutional neural network system based on residual learning which\nsignificantly improves over the state-of-the-art in cell nuclei classification.\n  However, the main thrust of our work is to demonstrate for the first time the\nmodels ability to transfer the learned concepts from one organ type to another,\nwith robust performance. Finally, we show that the combination of tissue types\nduring training increases not only classification accuracy but also overall\nsurvival analysis. The best model, trained on combined data of RCC and PCa,\nexhibits optimal performance on PCa classification and better survival group\nstratification than an expert pathologist ($p=0.006$).\n  All code, image data and expert labels are made publicly available to serve\nas benchmark for the community for future research into computational\npathology.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00897v1', ['Quantitative Methods', 'Tissues and Organs'], []]
[u'Design of artificial genetic regulatory networks with multiple delayed\n  adaptive responses', ['Pablo Kaluza', 'Masayo Inoue'], u'2016-06-02', u'Genetic regulatory networks with adaptive responses are widely studied in\nbiology. Usually, models consisting only of a few nodes have been considered.\nThey present one input receptor for activation and one output node where the\nadaptive response is computed. In this work, we design genetic regulatory\nnetworks with many receptors and many output nodes able to produce delayed\nadaptive responses. This design is performed by using an evolutionary algorithm\nof mutations and selections that minimizes an error function defined by the\nadaptive response in signal shapes. We present several examples of network\nconstructions with a predefined required set of adaptive delayed responses. We\nshow that an output node can have different kinds of responses as a function of\nthe activated receptor. Additionally, complex network structures are presented\nsince processing nodes can be involved in several input-output pathways.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00928v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
[u'Stochastic Model of Maturation and Vesicular Exchange in Cellular\n  Organelles', ['Quentin Vagne', 'Pierre Sens'], u'2016-06-03', u'The dynamical organization of membrane-bound organelles along intracellular\ntransport pathways relies on vesicular exchange between organelles and on\nbiochemical maturation of the organelle content by specific enzymes. The\nrelative importance of each mechanism in controlling organelle dynamics remains\ncontroversial, in particular for transport through the Golgi apparatus. Using a\nstochastic model, we show that full maturation of membrane-bound compartments\ncan be seen as the stochastic escape from a steady-state in which export is\ndominated by vesicular exchange. We show that full maturation can contribute a\nsignificant fraction of the total out-flux for small organelles such as\nendosomes and Golgi cisternae.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01075v1', ['Subcellular Processes'], []]
