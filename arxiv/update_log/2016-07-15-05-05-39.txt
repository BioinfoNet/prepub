[u'Generalizing The Mean Spherical Approximation as a Multiscale, Nonlinear\n  Boundary Condition at the Solute--Solvent Interface', ['Amirhossein Molavi Tabrizi', 'Matthew G. Knepley', 'Jaydeep P. Bardhan'], u'2016-07-14', u'In this paper we extend the familiar continuum electrostatic model with a\nperturbation to the usual macroscopic boundary condition. The perturbation is\nbased on the mean spherical approximation (MSA), to derive a multiscale\nhydration-shell boundary condition (HSBC). We show that the HSBC/MSA model\nreproduces MSA predictions for Born ions in a variety of polar solvents,\nincluding both protic and aprotic solvents. Importantly, the HSBC/MSA model\npredicts not only solvation free energies accurately but also solvation\nentropies, which standard continuum electrostatic models fail to predict. The\nHSBC/MSA model depends only on the normal electric field at the dielectric\nboundary, similar to our recent development of an HSBC model for charge-sign\nhydration asymmetry, and the reformulation of the MSA as a boundary condition\nenables its straightforward application to complex molecules such as proteins.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04257v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Molecular Mechanics of Chitin-Protein Interface: Terminus and Side Chain', ['Zechuan Yu', 'Denvid Lau'], u'2016-07-13', u'Chitin and protein are two main building blocks for many natural\nbiomaterials. The interaction between chitin and protein critically determines\nthe properties of the composite biological materials. As living organisms\nusually encounter complex ambient conditions like water, pH and ions are\ncritical factors towards the structural integrity of biomaterials. It is\ntherefore essential to study the chitin-protein interface under different\nenvironmental conditions. Here, an atomistic model consisting of a chitin\nsubstrate and a protein filament is constructed, which is regarded as a\nrepresentative of the chitin-protein interface existing in many chitin-based\nbiomaterials. Based on this model, the mechanical properties of chitin-protein\ninterface under different moisture and pH values are investigated through\nmolecular dynamics simulations. The results reveal a weakening effect of water\ntowards the chitin-protein interface, as well as acidity, i.e. the protonated\nprotein forms a stronger adhesion to chitin than that in the alkaline\nenvironment. In addition, the effect from side-chain of protein is studied and\nit is found that certain kinds of amino acid can form hydrophobic connections\nto chitin surface, which means that these peptides partly dodge the weakening\neffect of water. Our observation indicates that terminuses and side-chains in\nprotein are of importance in forming interfacial hydrogen bonds. From our full\natomistic models, we can observe some molecular mechanisms about how protein\ninteracts with chitin in different conditions, which may spotlight the\nengineering on biomaterials with similar interfaces.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04146v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'The network architecture of value learning', ['Marcelo G Mattar', 'Sharon L Thompson-Schill', 'Danielle S Bassett'], u'2016-07-14', u'Value guides behavior. With knowledge of stimulus values and action\nconsequences, behaviors that maximize expected reward can be selected. Prior\nwork has identified several brain structures critical for representing both\nstimuli and their values. Yet, it remains unclear how these structures interact\nwith one another and with other regions of the brain to support the dynamic\nacquisition of value-related knowledge. Here, we use a network neuroscience\napproach to examine how BOLD functional networks change as 20 healthy human\nsubjects learn the values of novel visual stimuli over the course of four\nconsecutive days. We show that connections between regions of the visual,\nfrontal, and cingulate cortices become increasingly stronger as learning\nprogresses, and that these changes are primarily confined to the temporal core\nof the network. These results demonstrate that functional networks dynamically\ntrack behavioral improvement in value judgments, and that interactions between\nnetwork communities form predictive biomarkers of learning.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04169v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

We show the existence of a small group of neurons capable of\ncontrolling and even silencing the bursting activity of the network. These\nneurons form a functional clique since only their activation in a precise order\nand within specific time windows is capable to ignite population bursts.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04052v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Zealots tame oscillations in the spatial rock-paper-scissors game', ['Attila Szolnoki', 'Matjaz Perc'], u'2016-07-14', u'The rock-paper-scissors game is a paradigmatic model for biodiversity, with\napplications ranging from microbial populations to human societies. Research\nhas shown, however, that mobility jeopardizes biodiversity by promoting the\nformation of spiral waves, especially if there is no conservation law in place\nfor the total number of competing players. Firstly, we show that even if such a\nconservation law applies, mobility still jeopardizes biodiversity in the\nspatial rock-paper-scissors game if only a small fraction of links of the\nsquare lattice is randomly rewired. Secondly, we show that zealots are very\neffective in taming the amplitude of oscillations that emerge due to mobility\nand/or interaction randomness, and this regardless of whether the later is\nquenched or annealed. While even a tiny fraction of zealots brings significant\nbenefits, at 5\\% occupancy zealots practically destroy all oscillations\nregardless of the intensity of mobility, and regardless of the type and\nstrength of randomness in the interaction structure. Interestingly, by annealed\nrandomness the impact of zealots is qualitatively the same as by mobility,\nwhich highlights that fast diffusion does not necessarily destroy the\ncoexistence of species, and that zealotry thus helps to recover the stable\nmean-field solution. Our results strengthen the important role of zealots in\nmodels of cyclic dominance, and they reveal fascinating evolutionary outcomes\nin structured populations that are a unique consequence of such uncompromising\nbehavior.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04269v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Sheldon Spectrum and the Plankton Paradox: Two Sides of the Same Coin. A\n  trait-based plankton size-spectrum model', ['Jose A. Cuesta', 'Gustav W. Delius', 'Richard Law'], u'2016-07-14', u'The Sheldon spectrum describes a remarkable regularity in aquatic ecosystems:\nthe biomass density as a function of logarithmic body mass is approximately\nconstant over many orders of magnitude. While size-spectrum models have\nexplained this phenomenon for assemblages of multicellular organisms, this\npaper introduces a species-resolved size-spectrum model to explain the\nphenomenon in unicellular plankton. A Sheldon spectrum spanning the cell-size\nrange of unicellular plankton necessarily consists of a large number of\ncoexisting species covering a wide range of characteristic sizes. The\ncoexistence of many phytoplankton species feeding on a small number of\nresources is known as the Paradox of the Plankton. Our model resolves the\nparadox by showing that coexistence is facilitated by the allometric scaling of\nfour physiological rates. Two of the allometries have empirical support, the\nremaining two emerge from predator-prey interactions exactly when the\nabundances follow a Sheldon spectrum. Our plankton model is a scale-invariant\ntrait-based size-spectrum model: it describes the abundance of phyto- and\nzooplankton cells as a function of both size and species trait (the maximal\nsize before cell division). It incorporates growth due to resource consumption\nand predation on smaller cells, death due to predation, and a flexible cell\ndivision process. We give analytic solutions at steady state for both the\nwithin-species size distributions and the relative abundances across species.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04158v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Methodology of Parameterization of Molecular Mechanics Force Field From\n  Quantum Chemistry Calculations using Genetic Algorithm: A case study of\n  methanol', ['Ying Li', 'Hui Li', 'Maria K. Y. Chan', 'Subramanian Sankaranarayanan', 'Benoit Rouxb'], u'2016-07-14', u'In molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, force field determines the capability\nof an individual model in capturing physical and chemistry properties. The\nmethod for generating proper parameters of the force field form is the key\ncomponent for computational research in chemistry, biochemistry, and\ncondensed-phase physics. Our study showed that the feasibility to predict\nexperimental condensed phase properties (i.e., density and heat of\nvaporization) of methanol through problem specific force field from only\nquantum chemistry information. To acquire the satisfying parameter sets of the\nforce field, the genetic algorithm (GA) is the main optimization method. For\nelectrostatic potential energy, we optimized both the electrostatic parameters\nof methanol using the GA method, which leads to low deviations of between the\nquantum mechanics (QM) calculations and the GA optimized parameters. We\noptimized the van der Waals (vdW) parameters both using GA and guided GA\nmethods by calibrating interaction energy of various methanol homo-clusters,\nsuch as nonamers, undecamers, or tridecamers. Excellent agreement between the\ntraining dataset from QM calculations (i.e., MP2) and GA optimized parameters\ncan be achieved. However, only the guided GA method, which eliminates the\noverestimation of interaction energy from MP2 calculations in the optimization\nprocess, provides proper vdW parameters for MD simulation to get the condensed\nphase properties (i.e., density and heat of vaporization) of methanol.\nThroughout the whole optimization process, the experimental value were not\ninvolved in the objective functions, but were only used for the purpose of\njustifying models (i.e., nonamers, undecamers, or tridecamers) and validating\nmethods (i.e., GA or guided GA). Our method is general and can be extended to\nany type of small organic molecule systems, as well as other descriptive\npolarizable force field.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04188v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]

Walczak'], u'2016-07-13', u'The simultaneous expression of the hunchback gene in the multiple nuclei of\nthe developing fly embryo gives us a unique opportunity to study how\ntranscription is regulated in functional organisms. A recently developed\nMS2-MCP technique for imaging transcription in living Drosophila embryos allows\nus to quantify the dynamics of the developmental transcription process. The\ninitial measurement of the morphogens by the hunchback promoter takes place\nduring very short cell cycles, not only giving each nucleus little time for a\nprecise readout, but also resulting in short time traces. Additionally, the\nrelationship between the measured signal and the promoter state depends on the\nmolecular design of the reporting probe. We develop an analysis approach based\non tailor made autocorrelation functions that overcomes the short trace\nproblems and quantifies the dynamics of transcription initiation. Based on life\nimaging data, we identify signatures of bursty transcription initiation from\nthe hunchback promoter. We show that the precision of the expression of the\nhunchback gene to measure its position along the anterior-posterior axis is low\nboth at the boundary and in the anterior even at cycle 13, suggesting\nadditional post-translational averaging mechanisms to provide the precision\nobserved in fixed material.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03957v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
[u'On the Ribosomal Density that Maximizes Protein Translation Rate', ['Yoram Zarai', 'Michael Margaliot', 'Tamir Tuller'], u'2016-07-14', u'During mRNA translation, several ribosomes attach to the same mRNA molecule\nsimultaneously translating it into a protein. This pipelining increases the\nprotein production rate. A natural and important question is what ribosomal\ndensity maximizes the protein production rate. Using mathematical models of\nribosome flow along both a linear and a circular mRNA molecule we prove that\ntypically the steady-state production rate is maximized when the ribosomal\ndensity is one half of the maximal possible density.
