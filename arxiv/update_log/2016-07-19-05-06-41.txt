[u'Neural scaling laws for an uncertain world', ['Marc W. Howard', 'Karthik H. Shankar'], u'2016-07-17', u'The Weber-Fechner law describes the form of psychological space in many\nbehavioral experiments involving perception of one-dimensional physical\nquantities. If the physical quantity is expressed using multiple neural\nreceptors, then placing receptive fields evenly along a logarithmic scale\nnaturally leads to the psychological Weber-Fechner law. In the visual system,\nthe spacing and width of extrafoveal receptive fields are consistent with\nlogarithmic scaling. Other sets of neural "receptors" appear to show the same\nqualitative properties, suggesting that this form of neural scaling reflects a\nsolution to a very general problem. This paper argues that these neural scaling\nlaws enable the brain to represent information about the world efficiently\nwithout making any assumptions about the statistics of the world. This analysis\nsuggests that the organization of neural scales to represent one-dimensional\nquantities, including more abstract quantities such as numerosity, time, and\nallocentric space, should have a universal form. The ratio of adjacent receptor\nspacings should be locally constant almost everywhere. Globally, for certain\nvalues of the ratio there should be a region of constant spacing---analogous to\nthe fovea in vision---for small values of the scale transitioning abruptly to a\nlogarithmic scale at larger values. The generality of these arguments suggest\nthey should apply to a range of neural systems and taken into consideration in\nthe design of artificial neural systems.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04886v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Inferring habitat quality and habitat selection using static site\n  occupancy models', ['Philip T. Patton', 'Krishna Pacifici', 'Jaime Collazo'], u'2016-07-18', u'When evaluating the ecological value of land use within a landscape,\ninvestigators typically rely on measures of habitat selection and habitat\nquality. Traditional measures of habitat selection and habitat quality require\ndata from resource intensive study designs (e.g., telemetry or mark-recapture).\nOften, managers must evaluate ecological value despite only having data from\nless resource intensive study designs. In this paper, we use occupancy data to\nmeasure habitat quality and habitat selection response for the Puerto Rican\nVireo, an endemic songbird whose population growth is depressed by brood\nparasitism from the Shiny Cowbird. We were interested in how vireo habitat\nquality and vireo habitat selection varied among three land uses (forest,\nshaded coffee plantations, and sun coffee) in Puerto Rico. We estimated vireo\noccupancy probability as a measure of habitat selection, and the probability of\ncowbird occurrence given vireo presence as a measure of habitat quality. To\nestimate the latter, we explored different ways of modeling the occurrence of\nthe two species jointly, and compared these models to independent models using\nmeasures of predictive performance. Vireos preferentially selected forested\nsites and shaded coffee sites over sun coffee sites. By our measure of habitat\nquality, either type of coffee plantation was poor quality, and the forested\nsites were high quality. This suggests that shade coffee may be an ecological\ntrap for the vireo in our study area. One joint model performed best by our\nmeasures of predictive ability, thus showing that the cowbird may not occur\nindependently of the vireo. Vireo population dynamics in our study area may\nbenefit from having large amounts of forest relative to coffee plantations.\nIncorporating species interactions into occupancy models has the potential to\nimprove monitoring for conservation.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.05175v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Effect of Heterogeneous Transmission Rate on Epidemic Spreading Over\n  Scale Free Networks', ['Vikram Sagar', 'Yi Zhao'], u'2016-07-18', u'In the present work the spread of epidemic is studied over complex networks\nwhich are characterized by power law degree distribution of links and\nheterogeneous rate of disease transmission. The random allocation of epidemic\ntransmission rates to the nodes results in the heterogeneity, which in turn\ncauses the segregation of nodes in terms of various sub populations. The aim of\nthe study is to gain microscopic insight into the effect of interactions among\nvarious sub populations in the spreading processes of disease over such\nnetworks. The discrete time Markov chain method based upon the susceptible\ninfected susceptible (SIS) model of diseases transmission has been used to\ndescribe the spreading of epidemic over the networks. The study is\nparameterized in terms of variable $\\lambda$, defined as the number of contacts\na node makes with the fraction of its neighboring nodes. From the simulation\nresults, it is found that the spread of epidemic on such networks is critical\nin terms of number of minimum contacts made by a node below which there is no\noutbreak of disease. The degree of infection in these networks is assessed from\nthe size of epidemic defined in terms of fraction of infected nodes of the\ntotal number and their corresponding level of infection. The results of the\nparametric study demonstrates the dependence of the epidemic size upon number\nof concurrent contacts made by a node ($\\lambda$ ) and the average number of\nlinks per node. In both these cases, the size of the epidemic is found to\nincrease with the corresponding increase in respective parameters.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04967v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Interaction patterns and diversity in assembled ecological communities', ['Guy Bunin'], u'2016-07-16', u'The assembly of ecological communities from a pool of species is central to\necology, but the effect of this process on properties of community interaction\nnetworks is still largely unknown. Here, we use a systematic analytical\nframework to describe how assembly from a species pool gives rise to community\nnetwork properties that differ from those of the pool: Compared to the pool,\nthe community shows a bias towards higher carrying capacities, weaker\ncompetitive interactions and stronger beneficial interactions. Moreover, even\nif interactions between all pool species are completely random, community\nnetworks are more structured, with correlations between interspecies\ninteractions, and between interactions and carrying capacities. Nonetheless, we\nshow that these properties are not sufficient to explain the coexistence of all\ncommunity species, and that it is a simple relation between interactions and\nspecies abundances that is responsible for the diversity within a community.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04734v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Beyond clonal interference: Scrutinizing the complexity of the dynamics\n  of three competing clones', ['Sylvain Billiard', 'Charline Smadi'], u'2016-07-15', u'In large adapting clonal species, several beneficial mutations can co-occur,\naffecting the process of adaptation. Several experimental and theoretical works\nshowed that clonal interference can be an important factor limiting the rate of\nadaptation. However, models done so far do not embrace the diversity of\nobserved dynamics in experiments, especially non-linear dynamics. We develop\nhere a stochastic model with explicit competitive interactions between clones\nand describe the complexity of the emerging dynamics of the population,\nsupposing that two mutants enter a resident population in a single copy at\ndifferent times. These clones can either get fixed, be lost or be maintained in\npolymorphism, depending on their competitive abilities. We show that\nfrequency-dependent selection can give rise to unexpected dynamics: competitive\ninteractions between clones can foster adaptation by increasing or decreasing\nboth the fixation probability and time of beneficial mutations. We finally\nestimate the likeliness of frequency-dependent selection and of the different\npotential final states of the population by assuming prior distributions of the\necological parameters. We show that under our assumptions, non-transitive\nfitness and non-linear dynamics are likely to play an important role into the\nadaptation of large clonal populations', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04656v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

[u'Certain uncertainty: using pointwise error estimates in super-resolution\n  microscopy', ['Martin Linden', 'Vladimir Curic', 'Elias Amselem', 'Johan Elf'], u'2016-07-15', u"Point-wise localization of individual fluorophores is a critical step in\nsuper-resolution microscopy and single particle tracking. Although the methods\nare limited by the accuracy in localizing individual flourophores, this\npoint-wise accuracy has so far only been estimated by theoretical best case\napproximations, disregarding for example motional blur, out of focus broadening\nof the point spread function and time varying changes in the fluorescence\nbackground. Here, we show that pointwise localization uncertainty can be\naccurately estimated directly from imaging data using a Laplace approximation\nconstrained by simple mircoscope properties. We further demonstrate that the\nestimated localization uncertainty can be used to improve downstream\nquantitative analysis, such as estimation of diffusion constants and detection\nof changes in molecular motion patterns. Most importantly, the accuracy of\nactual point localizations in live cell super-resolution microscopy can be\nimproved beyond the information theoretic lower bound for localization errors\nin individual images, by modeling the fluorophores' movement and accounting for\ntheir point-wise localization uncertainty.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04675v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
