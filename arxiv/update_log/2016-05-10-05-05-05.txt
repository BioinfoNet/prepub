[u'Topological language for RNA', ['Fenix W. D. Huang', 'Christian M. Reidys'], u'2016-05-09', u'In this paper we introduce a novel, context-free grammar, {\\it\nRNAFeatures$^*$}, capable of generating any RNA structure including pseudoknot\nstructures (pk-structure). We represent pk-structures as orientable fatgraphs,\nwhich naturally leads to a filtration by their topological genus. Within this\nframework, RNA secondary structures correspond to pk-structures of genus zero.\n{\\it RNAFeatures$^*$} acts on formal, arc-labeled RNA secondary structures,\ncalled $\\lambda$-structures. $\\lambda$-structures correspond one-to-one to\npk-structures together with some additional information. This information\nconsists of the specific rearrangement of the backbone, by which a pk-structure\ncan be made cross-free. {\\it RNAFeatures$^*$} is an extension of the grammar\nfor secondary structures and employs an enhancement by labelings of the symbols\nas well as the production rules. We discuss how to use {\\it RNAFeatures$^*$} to\nobtain a stochastic context-free grammar for pk-structures, using data of RNA\nsequences and structures. The induced grammar facilitates fast Boltzmann\nsampling and statistical analysis. As a first application, we present an $O(n\nlog(n))$ runtime algorithm which samples pk-structures based on ninety tRNA\nsequences and structures from the Nucleic Acid Database (NDB).', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02628v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Dynamic Decomposition of Spatiotemporal Neural Signals', ['Luca Ambrogioni', 'Marcel A. J. van Gerven', 'Eric Maris'], u'2016-05-09', u'Neural signals are characterized by rich temporal and spatiotemporal dynamics\nthat reflect the organization of cortical networks. Theoretical research has\nshown how neural networks can operate at different dynamic ranges that\ncorrespond to specific types of information processing. Here we present a data\nanalysis framework that uses a linearized model of these dynamic states in\norder to decompose the measured neural signal into a series of components that\ncapture both rhythmic and non-rhythmic neural activity. The method is based on\nstochastic differential equations and Gaussian process regression. Through\ncomputer simulations and analysis of magnetoencephalographic data, we\ndemonstrate the efficacy of the method in identifying meaningful modulations of\noscillatory signals corrupted by structured temporal and spatiotemporal noise.\nThese results suggest that the method is particularly suitable for the analysis\nand interpretation of complex temporal and spatiotemporal neural signals.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02609v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Studying the brain from adolescence to adulthood through sparse\n  multi-view matrix factorisations', ['Zi Wang', 'Vyacheslav Karolis', 'Chiara Nosarti', 'Giovanni Montana'], u'2016-05-09', u'Men and women differ in specific cognitive abilities and in the expression of\nseveral neuropsychiatric conditions. Such findings could be attributed to sex\nhormones, brain differences, as well as a number of environmental variables.\nExisting research on identifying sex-related differences in brain structure\nhave predominantly used cross-sectional studies to investigate, for instance,\ndifferences in average gray matter volumes (GMVs). In this article we explore\nthe potential of a recently proposed multi-view matrix factorisation (MVMF)\nmethodology to study structural brain changes in men and women that occur from\nadolescence to adulthood. MVMF is a multivariate variance decomposition\ntechnique that extends principal component analysis to "multi-view" datasets,\ni.e. where multiple and related groups of observations are available. In this\napplication, each view represents a different age group. MVMF identifies latent\nfactors explaining shared and age-specific contributions to the observed\noverall variability in GMVs over time. These latent factors can be used to\nproduce low-dimensional visualisations of the data that emphasise age-specific\neffects once the shared effects have been accounted for. The analysis of two\ndatasets consisting of individuals born prematurely as well as healthy controls\nprovides evidence to suggest that the separation between males and females\nbecomes increasingly larger as the brain transitions from adolescence to\nadulthood. We report on specific brain regions associated to these variance\neffects.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02560v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'The evolution of conditional moral assessment in indirect reciprocity', ['Tatsuya Sasaki', 'Isamu Okada', 'Yutaka Nakai'], u'2016-05-07', u"Indirect reciprocity is a major mechanism in the maintenance of cooperation\namong unfamiliar individuals. Indirect reciprocity leads to conditional\ncooperation according to social norms that discriminate the good (those who\ndeserve to be rewarded with help) and the bad (those who should be punished by\nrefusal of help). Despite intensive research, however, there is no definitive\nconsensus on what social norms best promote cooperation through indirect\nreciprocity, and it remains unclear even how those who refuse help to the bad\nshould be assessed. Here we propose a new simple norm called 'Staying' that\nprescribes to abstain from assessment, with the focal individual's image\nremaining unchanged, if its opponent has a bad image. We fully analyse the\nStaying norm in terms of evolutionary game theory and unveil that Staying is\nmost effective in establishing cooperation, compared to the prevailing social\nnorms which rely on constant monitoring and unconditional assessment. The\nexcellence of Staying suggests the limitation of strict application of moral\njudgment.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02166v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Stochastic population growth in spatially heterogeneous environments:\n  The density-dependent case', ['Alexandru Hening', 'Dang H. Nguyen', 'George Yin'], u'2016-05-06', u'This work is devoted to studying the dynamics of a population subject to the\ncombined effects of stochastic environments, competition for resources, and\nspatio-temporal heterogeneity and dispersal. The population is spread\nthroughout $n$ patches whose population abundances are modeled as the solutions\nof a system of nonlinear stochastic differential equations living on\n$[0,\\infty)^n$.\n  We prove that $\\lambda$, the stochastic growth rate of the system in the\nabsence of competition, determines the long-term behaviour of the population.\nThe parameter $\\lambda$ can be expressed as the Lyapunov exponent of an\nassociated linearized system of stochastic differential equations. Detailed\nanalysis shows that if $\\lambda>0$, the population abundances converge\npolynomially fast to a unique invariant probability measure on $(0,\\infty)^n$,\nwhile when $\\lambda<0$, the abundances of the patches converge almost surely to\n$0$ exponentially fast.\n  Compared to recent developments, our model incorporates very general\ndensity-dependent growth rates and competition terms. Another significant\ngeneralization of our work is allowing the environmental noise driving our\nsystem to be degenerate. This is more natural from a biological point of view\nsince, for example, the environments of the different patches can be perfectly\ncorrelated.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02027v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Cell-cycle coupled expression minimizes random fluctuations in gene\n  product levels', ['Mohammad Soltani', 'Abhyudai Singh'], u'2016-05-07', u'Expression of many genes varies as a cell transitions through different\ncell-cycle stages. How coupling between stochastic expression and cell cycle\nimpacts cell-to-cell variability (noise) in the level of protein is not well\nunderstood. We analyze a model, where a stable protein is synthesized in random\nbursts, and the frequency with which bursts occur varies within the cell cycle.\nFormulas quantifying the extent of fluctuations in the protein copy number are\nderived and decomposed into components arising from the cell cycle and\nstochastic processes. The latter stochastic component represents contributions\nfrom bursty expression and errors incurred during partitioning of molecules\nbetween daughter cells. These formulas reveal an interesting trade-off:\ncell-cycle dependencies that amplify the noise contribution from bursty\nexpression also attenuate the contribution from partitioning errors. We\ninvestigate existence of optimum strategies for coupling expression to the cell\ncycle that minimize the stochastic component. Intriguingly, results show that a\nzero production rate throughout the cell cycle, with expression only occurring\njust before cell division minimizes noise from bursty expression for a fixed\nmean protein level. In contrast, the optimal strategy in the case of\npartitioning errors is to make the protein just after cell division. We provide\nexamples of regulatory proteins that are expressed only towards the end of cell\ncycle, and argue that such strategies enhance robustness of cell-cycle\ndecisions to the intrinsic stochasticity of gene expression.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02251v1', ['Quantitative Methods', 'Molecular Networks'], []]
[u'New Approaches to Identify Gene-by-Gene Interactions in Genome Wide\n  Association Studies', ['Chen Lu'], u'2016-05-07', u'Genetic variants identified to date by genome-wide association studies only\nexplain a small fraction of total heritability. Gene-by-gene interaction is one\nimportant potential source of unexplained heritability. In the first part of\nthis dissertation, a novel approach to detect such interactions is proposed.\nThis approach utilizes penalized regression and sparse estimation principles,\nand incorporates outside biological knowledge through a network-based penalty.\nThe method is tested on simulated data under various scenarios. Simulations\nshow that with reasonable outside biological knowledge, the new method performs\nnoticeably better than current stage-wise strategies, especially when the\nmarginal strength of main effects is weak.\n  The proposed method is designed for single-cohort analyses. However, it is\ngenerally acknowledged that only multi-cohort analyses have sufficient power to\nuncover genes and gene-by-gene interactions with moderate effects on traits,\nsuch as likely underlie complex diseases. Multi-cohort, meta-analysis\napproaches for penalized regressions are developed and investigated in the\nsecond part of this dissertation. Specifically, I propose two different ways of\nutilizing data-splitting principles in multi-cohort settings and develop three\nprocedures to conduct meta-analysis. Using the method developed in the first\npart of this dissertation as an example of penalized regressions, three\nproposed meta-analysis procedures are compared to mega-analysis using a\nsimulation study. The results suggest that the best approach is to split the\nparticipating cohorts into two groups.\n  In the last part of this dissertation, the novel method developed in the\nfirst part is applied to the Framingham Heart Study measures on total plasma\nImmunoglobulin E (IgE) concentrations, C-reactive protein levels, and Fasting\nGlucose.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02144v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Rescaling of spatio-temporal sensing in eukaryotic chemotaxis', ['Keita Kamino', 'Yohei Kondo'], u'2016-05-07', u'Eukaryotic cells can detect the direction of a chemoattractant gradient\nprecisely by generating intracellular gradients of signaling molecules that\nmirror the extracellular gradient ? an ability called directional sensing.\nQuantitative experiments have revealed two characteristic input-output\nrelations of the system: First, in spatially-graded stimuli, the internal\ngradients of the signaling molecules at steady state reflect the relative\nsteepness?rather than the absolute concentration?of the chemoattractant along\nthe cell body. Second, upon a spatially homogeneous temporal increase in the\nchemoattractant concentration, the signaling molecule is transiently activated\nsuch that the response magnitude is determined by the ratio of the change in\nthe input stimuli before and after the increase. However, the underlying\nmechanisms that endow the system with these response properties remain elusive.\nHere, by adopting a widely used modeling framework of directional sensing,\ni.e., local excitation and global inhibition (LEGI), we propose the hypothesis\nthat the two scaling behaviors stem from a single design principle, namely,\ninvariance of the governing equations to a scale transformation of the input\nlevel. Analyses of the LEGI-based model identify two different types of scale\ninvariance, each of which is responsible for the two response properties. Our\nhypothesis leads to an experimentally testable prediction that a system with\nboth types of invariance detects the relative steepness even in spatio-temporal\ngradient stimuli such as waves. Furthermore, we show that such behavior is\nindependent of specific network topologies as long as the scale invariance\nholds, demonstrating the generic relationship between the scale invariance and\nthe response properties.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02186v1', ['Cell Behavior'], []]
[u'Variance component score test for time-course gene set analysis of\n  longitudinal RNA-seq data', ['Denis Agniel', 'Boris P Hejblum'], u'2016-05-08', u'As gene expression measurement technology is shifting from microarrays to\nsequencing, the statistical tools available for analyzing corresponding data\nrequire substantial modifications since RNA-seq data are measured as counts.\nRecently, it has been proposed to tackle the count nature of these data by\nmodeling log-count reads per million as continuous variables, using\nnonparametric regression to account for their inherent heteroscedasticity.\nAdopting such a framework, we propose tcgsaseq, a principled and efficient\ntop-down method for detecting longitudinal changes in RNA-seq gene sets.\nConsidering gene sets defined a priori, tcgsaseq identifies those whose\nexpression vary over time, based on an original variance component score test\naccounting for both covariates and heteroscedasticity. We demonstrate that\ndespite the presence of a nonparametric component, our test statistic has a\nsimple form and limiting distribution, and both may be computed quickly. A\npermutation version of the test is additionally proposed for very small sample\nsizes. Applied to both simulated data and two real datasets, the proposed\nmethod is shown to exhibit very good statistical properties, with an increase\nin stability and power when compared to state of the art methods.
