[u'Statistical Mechanics and Kinetics of Amyloid Fibrillation', ['Liu Hong', 'Chiu Fan Lee', 'Ya Jing Huang'], u'2016-09-06', u'Amyloid fibrillation is a protein self-assembly phenomenon that is intimately\nrelated to well-known human neurodegenerative diseases. During the past few\ndecades, striking advances have been achieved in our understanding of the\nphysical origin of this phenomenon and they constitute the contents of this\nreview. Starting from a minimal model of amyloid fibrils, we explore\nsystematically the equilibrium and kinetic aspects of amyloid fibrillation in\nboth dilute and semi-dilute limits. We then incorporate further molecular\nmechanisms into the analyses. We also discuss the mathematical foundation of\nkinetic modeling based on chemical mass-action equations, the quantitative\nlinkage with experimental measurements, as well as the procedure to perform\nglobal fitting.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01569v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]

Allendorfer', 'Jennifer Vannest', 'Scott Holland', 'Aimee Dietz', 'Jerzy P. Szaflarski'], u'2016-09-06', u'Current theories of language recovery after stroke are limited by a reliance\non small studies. Here, we aimed to test predictions of current theory and\nresolve inconsistencies regarding right hemispheric contributions to long-term\nrecovery. We first defined the canonical semantic network in 43 healthy\ncontrols. Then, in a group of 43 patients with chronic post-stroke aphasia, we\ntested whether activity in this network predicted performance on measures of\nsemantic comprehension, naming, and fluency while controlling for lesion volume\neffects. Canonical network activation accounted for 22-33% of the variance in\nlanguage test scores. Whole-brain analyses corroborated these findings, and\nrevealed a core set of regions showing positive relationships to all language\nmeasures. We next evaluated the relationship between activation magnitudes in\nleft and right hemispheric portions of the network, and how right hemispheric\nactivation related to the extent of left hemispheric damage. Activation\nmagnitudes in the each hemispheric network were strongly correlated, but four\nright frontal regions showed heightened activity in patients with large\nlesions. Activity in two of these regions (inferior frontal gyrus pars\nopercularis and supplementary motor area) was associated with better language\nabilities in patients with larger lesions, but poorer language abilities in\npatients with smaller lesions. Our results indicate that bilateral language\nnetworks support language processing after stroke, and that right hemispheric\nactivations related to extensive left hemisphere damage occur outside of the\ncanonical semantic network and differentially contribute to in their\nrelationship to behavior depending on the extent of left hemispheric damage', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01663v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

As an alternative, we propose a new, reproducible approach\nthat exploits how frequent the BOLD-signal correlation between two nodes is\nnegative. We validated this novel probability-based modularity approach on two\nindependent publically available resting state connectome datasets (the Human\nConnectome Project and the 1000 Functional Connectomes) and demonstrated that\nnegative correlations alone are sufficient in understanding resting-state fMRI\nconnectome modularity. In fact, this approach permits a dual formulation that\nleads to equivalent solutions regardless of whether one considers positive or\nnegative edges. Results confirmed the superiority of our approach in that: 1)\ncorrelations with highest probability of being negative are consistently placed\nbetween modules, 2) due to the equivalent dual forms, no arbitrary weighting\nfactor is required to balance the influence between negative and positive\ncorrelations, as is currently employed in all Q modularity-based approaches.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01384v1', ['Neurons and Cognition', 'Quantitative Methods'], []]

Kurths'], u'2016-09-03', u'Neuronal systems have been modeled by complex networks in different\ndescription levels. Recently, it has been verified that networks can\nsimultaneously exhibit one coherent and other incoherent domain, known as\nchimera states. In this work, we study the existence of chimera states in a\nnetwork considering the connectivity matrix based on the cat cerebral cortex.\nThe cerebral cortex of the cat can be separated in 65 cortical areas organised\ninto the four cognitive regions: visual, auditory, somatosensory-motor and\nfrontolimbic. We consider a network where the local dynamics is given by the\nHindmarsh-Rose model. The Hindmarsh-Rose equations are a well known model of\nneuronal activity that has been considered to simulate membrane potential in\nneuron. Here, we analyse under which conditions chimera states are present, as\nwell as the affects induced by intensity of coupling on them. We observe the\nexistence of chimera states in that incoherent structure can be composed of\ndesynchronised spikes or desynchronised bursts. Moreover, we find that chimera\nstates with desynchronised bursts are more robust to neuronal noise than with\ndesynchronised spikes.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01534v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

Olufsen'], u'2016-09-06', u'The initial reaction of the body to pathogenic microbial infection or severe\ntissue trauma is an acute inflammatory response. The magnitude of such a\nresponse is of critical importance, since an uncontrolled response can cause\nfurther tissue damage, sepsis, and ultimately death, while an insufficient\nresponse can result in inadequate clearance of pathogens. A normal inflammatory\nresponse helps to annihilate threats posed by microbial pathogenic ligands,\nsuch as endotoxins, and thus, restore the body to a healthy state. Using a\npersonalized mathematical model, comprehension and a detailed description of\nthe interactions between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines can provide\nimportant insight in the evaluation of a patient with sepsis or a susceptible\npatient in surgery. Our model is calibrated to experimental data obtained from\nexperiments measuring pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor\nnecrosis factor (TNF-), and chemokine ligand-8 (CXCL8)) and the\nanti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) over 8 hours in 20 healthy\nyoung male subjects, given a low dose intravenous injection of\nlipopolysaccharide (LPS), resulting in endotoxin-stimulated inflammation.\nThrough the calibration process, we created a personalized mathematical model\nthat can accurately determine individual differences between subjects, as well\nas identify those who showed an abnormal response.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01570v1', ['Quantitative Methods', 'Tissues and Organs'], []]

[u'Uniform Approximation of Solutions by Elimination of Intermediate\n  Species in Deterministic Reaction Networks', ['Daniele Cappelletti', 'Carsten Wiuf'], u'2016-09-06', u'Chemical reactions often proceed through the formation and the consumption of\nintermediate species. An example is the creation and subsequent degradation of\nthe substrate-enzyme complexes in an enzymatic reaction. In this paper we\nprovide a setting, based on ordinary differential equations, in which the\npresence of intermediate species has little effect on the overall dynamics of a\nbiological system. The result provides a method to perform model reduction by\nelimination of intermediate species. We study the problem in a multiscale\nsetting, where the species abundances as well a the reaction rates scale to\ndifferent orders of magnitudes. The different time and concentration scales are\nparameterised by a single parameter $N$. We show that a solution to the\noriginal reaction system is uniformly approximated on compact time intervals to\na solution of a reduced reaction system without intermediates and to a solution\nof a certain limiting reaction systems, which does not depend on $N$. Known\napproximation techniques such as the theorems by Tikhonov and Fenichel cannot\nreadily be used in this framework.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01405v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
[u'Assessment of P-value variability in the current replicability crisis', ['Olga A. Vsevolozhskaya', 'Gabriel Ruiz', 'Dmitri V. Zaykin'], u'2016-09-06', u'Increased availability of data and accessibility of computational tools in\nrecent years have created unprecedented opportunities for scientific research\ndriven by statistical analysis. Inherent limitations of statistics impose\nconstrains on reliability of conclusions drawn from data but misuse of\nstatistical methods is a growing concern. Significance, hypothesis testing and\nthe accompanying P-values are being scrutinized as representing most widely\napplied and abused practices. One line of critique is that P-values are\ninherently unfit to fulfill their ostensible role as measures of scientific\nhypothesis\'s credibility. It has also been suggested that while P-values may\nhave their role as summary measures of effect, researchers underappreciate the\ndegree of randomness in the P-value. High variability of P-values would suggest\nthat having obtained a small P-value in one study, one is, nevertheless, likely\nto obtain a much larger P-value in a similarly powered replication study. Thus,\n"replicability of P-value" is itself questionable. To characterize P-value\nvariability one can use prediction intervals whose endpoints reflect the likely\nspread of P-values that could have been obtained by a replication study.\nUnfortunately, the intervals currently in use, the P-intervals, are based on\nunrealistic implicit assumptions. Namely, P-intervals are constructed with the\nassumptions that imply substantial chances of encountering large values of\neffect size in an observational study, which leads to bias. As an alternative\nto P-intervals, we develop a method that gives researchers flexibility by\nproviding them with the means to control these assumptions. Unlike endpoints of\nP-intervals, endpoints of our intervals are directly interpreted as\nprobabilistic bounds for replication P-values and are resistant to selection\nbias contingent upon approximate prior knowledge of the effect size\ndistribution.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01664v1', ['Genomics'], []]
