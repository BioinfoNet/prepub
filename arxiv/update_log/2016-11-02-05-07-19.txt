[u"Folding with a protein's native shortcut network", ['Susan Khor'], u'2016-11-01', u"The physical basis of shortcut edges in a Protein Residue Network (PRN) and\ntheir applicability to a simplified protein folding pathway problem is\ninvestigated.

[u'Towards a theory of cortical columns: From spiking neurons to\n  interacting neural populations of finite size', ['Tilo Schwalger', 'Moritz Deger', 'Wulfram Gerstner'], u'2016-11-01', u'Neural population equations such as neural mass or field models are widely\nused to study brain activity on a large scale. However, the relation of these\nmodels to the properties of single neurons is unclear. Here we derive an\nequation for several interacting populations at the mesoscopic scale starting\nfrom a microscopic model of randomly connected generalized integrate-and-fire\nneuron models. Each population consists of 50 -- 2000 neurons of the same type\nbut different populations account for different neuron types. The stochastic\npopulation equations that we find reveal how spike-history effects in\nsingle-neuron dynamics such as refractoriness and adaptation interact with\nfinite-size fluctuations on the population level. Efficient integration of the\nstochastic mesoscopic equations reproduces the statistical behavior of the\npopulation activities obtained from microscopic simulations of a full spiking\nneural network model. The theory describes nonlinear emergent dynamics like\nfinite-size-induced stochastic transitions in multistable networks and\nsynchronization in balanced networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The\nmesoscopic equations are employed to rapidly simulate a model of a local\ncortical microcircuit consisting of eight neuron types. Our theory establishes\na general framework for modeling finite-size neural population dynamics based\non single cell and synapse parameters and offers an efficient approach to\nanalyzing cortical circuits and computations.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00294v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Critical Amount of Resource in Containing Catastrophic Epidemics', ['Xiaolong Chen', 'Tianshou Zhou', 'Ling Feng', 'Chun Yang', 'Moming Wang', 'Xiaoming Fan', 'Yanqing Hu'], u'2016-11-01', u'During an epidemic control, the containment of the disease is usually\nachieved through increasing public health resource to quickly identify,\nquarantine and cure the infected population. However, the exact impact of this\nresource expenditure on the physical spreading dynamics remains unknown. In\nthis work we find that the influence of resource expenditure exhibits extreme\ncritical behaviour, which is the first order phase transition in nature.\nSpecifically, if the amount of invested resource is below a critical value, a\nsignificant fraction of the total population will become infected; once it is\nmore than that critical value, the disease outbreak can be effectively\neradicated or contained. This finding implies that the government expenditure\non infectious disease control needs to meet a certain critical threshold to be\nof any effectiveness. Otherwise, the outbreak could be catastrophic. We have\nvalidated our theoretical results on one real contact network and three typical\nsocial networks, with all of them exhibiting abrupt catastrophic jumps related\nto a critical resource amount. Contrary to common sense, we find that such a\ncatastrophic jump is more pronounced in the less contagious diseases, yet such\ndiseases are usually among the most fatal ones. Moreover, we observe a\nnon-trivial resource amount requirement, that even with a single node as\ninfection source, public resource needs to meet a significant amount to ensure\nepidemic containment. Our new findings have important implications on public\nhealth policies regarding the devoted public resource into epidemic disease\ncontrol.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00212v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Characterization of phase transitions in a model ecosystem of sessile\n  species', ['Florian Uekermann', 'Joachim Mathiesen', 'Namiko Mitarai'], u'2016-11-01', u'We consider a model ecosystem of sessile species competing for space. In\nparticular, we consider the system introduced in [Mathiesen et al. Phys. Rev.\nLett. 107, 188101 (2011)] where species compete according to a fixed\ninteraction network with links determined by a Bernoulli process. In the limit\nof a small introduction rate of new species, the model exhibits a discontinuous\ntransition from a high-diversity state to a low-diversity state as the\ninteraction probability between species, $\\gamma$, is increased from zero. Here\nwe explore the effects of finite introduction rates and system-size on the\nphase transition by utilizing efficient parallel computing. We find that the\nlow state appears for $\\gamma>\\gamma_c$. As $\\gamma$ is increased further, the\nhigh state approaches to the low state, suggesting the possibility that the two\nstates merge at a high $\\gamma$. We find that the fraction of time spent in the\nhigh state becomes longer with higher introduction rates, but the availability\nof the two states is rather insensitive to the value of the introduction rate.\nFurthermore we establish a relation between the introduction rate and the\nsystem size, which preserves the probability for the system to remain in the\nhigh-diversity state.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00171v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'A study on the evolution of a community population by cumulative and\n  fractional calculus approaches', ['F. Buyukklc', 'Z. Ok Bayrakdar', 'D. Demirhan'], u'2016-10-31', u'Nowadays, in our globalized world,the local and intercountry movements of\npopulation have been increased. This situation makes it important for host\ncountries to do right predictions for the future population of their native\npeople as well as immigrant people. The knowledge of the attained number of\naccumulated population is necessary for future planning, concerning to\neducation,health, job, housing, safety requirements, etc. In this work, for\nupdating historically well known formulas of population dynamics of a community\nare revisited in the framework of compound growth and fractional calculus to\nget more realistic relations. Within this context, for a time t, the population\nevolution of a society which owns two different components is calculated.\nConcomitant relations have been developed to provide a comparison between the\nnative population and the immigrant population that come into existence where\nat each time interval a colonial population is joined. Eventually at time t,\nthe case where the native population becomes equal to immigrant population is\ndiscussed. Moreover, the differential equation of a probability function for\nthe equilibrium state of accumulative population is obtained. It is seen that\nthe equilibrium solution can be written as a series in terms of Bernoulli\nnumbers. In the calculation of population dynamics, Mittag- Leffler(M-L)\nfunction replaces the exponential function.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00259v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Geodesic curvature driven surface microdomain formation', ['Melissa R. Adkins', 'Y. C. Zhou'], u'2016-11-01', u'Lipid bilayer membranes are not uniform and clusters of lipids in a more\nordered state exist within the generally disorder lipid milieu of the membrane.\nThese clusters of ordered lipids microdomains are now referred to as lipid\nrafts. Recent reports attribute the formation of these microdomains to the\ngeometrical and molecular mechanical mismatch of lipids of different species on\nthe boundary. Here we introduce the geodesic curvature to characterize the\ngeometry of the domain boundary, and develop a geodesic curvature energy model\nto describe the formation of these microdomains as a result of energy\nminimization. Our model accepts the intrinsic geodesic curvature of any binary\nlipid mixture as an input, and will produce microdomains of the given geodesic\ncurvature as demonstrated by three sets of numerical simulations. Our results\nare in contrast to the surface phase separation predicted by the classical\nsurface Cahn-Hilliard equation, which tends to generate large domains as a\nresult of the minimizing line tension. Our model provides a direct and\nquantified description of the structure inhomogeneity of lipid bilayer\nmembrane, and can be coupled to the investigations of biological processes on\nmembranes for which such inhomogeneity plays essential roles.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00103v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
