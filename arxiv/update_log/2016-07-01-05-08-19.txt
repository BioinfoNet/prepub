[u'Structure-based prediction of protein-folding transition paths', ['William M. Jacobs', 'Eugene I. Shakhnovich'], u'2016-06-28', u'We propose a general theory to describe the distribution of protein-folding\ntransition paths. We show that transition paths follow a predictable sequence\nof high-free-energy transient states that are separated by free-energy\nbarriers. Each transient state corresponds to the assembly of one or more\ndiscrete, cooperative units, which are determined directly from the native\nstructure. We show that the transition state on a folding pathway is reached\nwhen a small number of critical contacts are formed between a specific set of\nsubstructures, after which folding proceeds downhill in free energy. This\napproach suggests a natural resolution for distinguishing parallel folding\npathways and provides a simple means to predict the rate-limiting step in a\nfolding reaction. Our theory identifies a common folding mechanism for proteins\nwith diverse native structures and establishes general principles for the\nself-assembly of polymers with specific interactions.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08874v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]

Understanding and\nquantifying these differences is a necessary first step towards developing\npredictive methods derived from network topology. Here, we present a method to\nquantify individual differences in brain functional dynamics by applying\nhypergraph analysis, a method from dynamic network theory. Using a summary\nmetric derived from the hypergraph formalism---hypergraph cardinality---we\ninvestigate individual variations in two separate and complementary data sets.\nThe first data set ("multi-task") consists of 77 individuals engaging in four\nconsecutive cognitive tasks. We observed that hypergraph cardinality exhibits\nvariation across individuals while remaining consistent within individuals\nbetween tasks; moreover, one of the memory tasks evinced a marginally\nsignificant correspondence between hypergraph cardinality and age. This finding\nmotivated a similar analysis of the second data set ("age-memory"), in which 95\nindividuals of varying ages performed a memory task with a similar structure to\nthe multi-task memory task. With the increased age range in the age-memory data\nset, the correlation between hypergraph cardinality and age correspondence\nbecomes significant. We discuss these results in the context of the well-known\nfinding linking age with network structure, and suggest that age-related\nchanges in brain function can be better understood by taking an integrative\napproach that incorporates information about the dynamics of functional\ninteractions.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.09545v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

The neural representation of the acoustic stimuli\nresults from the interplay of locally differing input and the organization of\nspectral and temporal neural preferences that change gradually across the\nnucleus. This raises the question how similar the neural representation of the\ncommunication sounds is across these gradients of neural preferences, and\nwhether it also changes gradually. Multi-unit cluster spike trains were\nrecorded from guinea pigs presented with a spectrotemporally rich set of eleven\nspecies-specific communication sounds. Using cross-correlation, we analyzed the\nresponse similarity of spiking activity across a broad frequency range for\nsimilarly and differently frequency-tuned neurons. Furthermore, we separated\nthe contribution of the stimulus to the correlations to investigate whether\nsimilarity is only attributable to the stimulus, or, whether interactions exist\nbetween the multi-unit clusters that lead to correlations and whether these\nfollow the same representation as the response similarity. We found that\nsimilarity of responses is dependent on the neurons' spatial distance for\nsimilarly and differently frequency-tuned neurons, and that similarity\ndecreases gradually with spatial distance. Significant neural correlations\nexist, and contribute to the response similarity. Our findings suggest that for\nmulti-unit clusters in the mammalian inferior colliculus, the gradual response\nsimilarity with spatial distance to natural complex sounds is shaped by neural\ninteractions and the gradual organization of neural preferences.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.09277v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

[u'Multilayer motif analysis of brain networks', ['Federico Battiston', 'Vincenzo Nicosia', 'Mario Chavez', 'Vito Latora'], u'2016-06-29', u'In the last decade network science has shed new light on the anatomical\nconnectivity and on correlations in the activity of different areas of the\nhuman brain. The study of brain networks has made possible in fact to detect\nthe central areas of a neural system, and to identify its building blocks by\nlooking at overabundant small subgraphs, known as motifs. However, network\nanalysis of the brain has so far mainly focused on structural and functional\nnetworks as separate entities. The recently developed mathematical framework of\nmulti-layer networks allows to perform a multiplex analysis of the human brain\nwhere the structural and functional layers are considered at the same time. In\nthis work we describe how to classify subgraphs in multiplex networks, and we\nextend motif analysis to networks with many layers. We then extract multi-layer\nmotifs in brain networks of healthy subjects by considering networks with two\nlayers, respectively obtained from diffusion and functional magnetic resonance\nimaging. Results indicate the statistically significance of subgraphs where the\npresence of a physical connection between two areas (link at the structural\nlayer) coexists with positive correlations in their activity (positive link in\nthe functional layer). Finally, we investigate the existence of a reinforcement\nmechanism between the two layers by looking at how the presence of a link in\none layer depends on the intensity of the connection in the other one. Showing\nthat functional connectivity is non-trivially constrained by the underlying\nanatomical network, our work contributes to a better understanding of the\ninterplay between structure and function in the human brain.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.09115v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

[u'A tractable method for describing complex couplings between neurons and\n  population rate', ['Christophe Gardella', 'Olivier Marre', 'Thierry Mora'], u'2016-06-28', u'Neurons within a population are strongly correlated, but how to simply\ncapture these correlations is still a matter of debate. Recent studies have\nshown that the activity of each cell is influenced by the population rate,\ndefined as the summed activity of all neurons in the population. However, an\nexplicit, tractable model for these interactions is still lacking. Here we\nbuild a probabilistic model of population activity that reproduces the firing\nrate of each cell, the distribution of the population rate, and the linear\ncoupling between them. This model is tractable, meaning that its parameters can\nbe learned in a few seconds on a standard computer even for large population\nrecordings. We inferred our model for a population of 160 neurons in the\nsalamander retina. In this population, single-cell firing rates depended in\nunexpected ways on the population rate. In particular, some cells had a\npreferred population rate at which they were most likely to fire. These complex\ndependencies could not be explained by a linear coupling between the cell and\nthe population rate. We designed a more general, still tractable model that\ncould fully account for these non-linear dependencies. We thus provide a simple\nand computationally tractable way to learn models that reproduce the dependence\nof each neuron on the population rate.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08889v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

Here, we describe a simple and generic framework in which two common\nformalisms can be used interchangeably: (i) a continuous-time division process\ndescribed by a hazard function and (ii) a discrete-time equation describing\ncell size across generations (where the unit of time is a cell cycle). In our\nframework, this second process is a discrete-time Langevin equation with a\nsimple physical analogue. By perturbative expansion around the mean initial\nsize (or inter-division time), we show explicitly how this framework describes\na wide range of division control mechanisms, including combinations of time and\nsize control, as well as the constant added size mechanism recently found to\ncapture several aspects of the cell division behavior of different bacteria. As\nwe show by analytical estimates and numerical simulation, the available data\nare characterized with great precision by the first-order approximation of this\nexpansion. Hence, a single dimensionless parameter defines the strength and the\naction of the division control. However, this parameter may emerge from several\nmechanisms, which are distinguished only by higher-order terms in our\nperturbative expansion.

Various rare variant tests were proposed to increase power by\naggregating SNPs within a fixed genomic region, such as a gene or pathway.\nHowever, a gene could contain from several to thousands of markers, and not all\nof them may be related to the phenotype. Combining functional and\nnon-functional SNPs in arbitrary genomic region could impair the testing power.\nResults: We propose a Zoom-Focus algorithm (ZFA) to locate the optimal testing\nregion within a given genomic region, as a wrapper function to be applied in\nconjunction with rare variant association tests. In the first Zooming step, a\ngiven genomic region is partitioned by order of two, and the best partition is\nlocated within all partition levels. In the next Focusing step, boundaries of\nthe zoomed region are refined.
