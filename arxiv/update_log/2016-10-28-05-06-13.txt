[u'Quantifying word salad: The structural randomness of verbal reports\n  produced during First Episode Psychosis predicts negative symptoms and\n  Schizophrenia diagnosis 6 months later', ['Natalia B. Mota', 'Mauro Copelli', 'Sidarta Ribeiro'], u'2016-10-26', u'Background: The precise quantification of negative symptoms is necessary to\nimprove differential diagnosis and prognosis prediction in Schizophrenia. In\nchronic psychotic patients, the representation of verbal reports as word graphs\nprovides automated sorting of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and control\ngroups based on the degree of speech connectedness. Here we aim to use machine\nlearning to verify whether speech connectedness can predict negative symptoms\nand Schizophrenia diagnosis during first episode psychosis. Methods: PANSS\nscores and memory reports were collected from 21 patients undergoing first\nepisode psychosis followed for 6 months to establish DSM-IV diagnosis, and 21\nhealthy controls. Each report was represented as a graph in which words\ncorresponded to nodes, and node temporal succession corresponded to edges.\nThree connectedness attributes were extracted from each graph, z-scores to\nrandom graph distributions were measured, correlated with the PANSS negative\nsubscale, combined into a single Fragmentation Index, and used for predictions.\nFindings: Random-like speech was prevalent among Schizophrenia patients (64% x\n5% in Control group, p=0.0002). Connectedness explained 92% of the PANSS\nnegative subscale variance (p=0.0001). The Fragmentation Index classified low\nversus high scores of PANSS negative subscale with 93% accuracy (AUC=1), and\npredicted Schizophrenia diagnosis with 89% accuracy (AUC=0.89). Interpretation:\nThe structural randomness of speech graph connectedness is increased in\nSchizophrenia. It provides a quantitative measurement of word salad as a\nFragmentation Index that tightly correlates with negative symptoms and predicts\nSchizophrenia diagnosis during first episode psychosis.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08566v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

[u'Aligning coding sequences with frameshift extension penalties', ['Safa Jammali', 'Esaie Kuitche', 'Ayoub Rachati', 'Francois Belanger', 'Michelle Scott', 'Aida Ouangraoua'], u'2016-10-27', u'Frameshift translation is an important phenomenon that contributes to the\nappearance of novel Coding DNA Sequences (CDS) and functions in gene evolution,\nby allowing alternative amino acid translations of genes coding regions.\nFrameshift translations can be identified by aligning two CDS, from a same gene\nor from homologous genes, while accounting for their codon structure. Two main\nclasses of algorithms have been proposed to solve the problem of aligning CDS,\neither by amino acid sequence alignment back-translation, or by simultaneously\naccounting for the nucleotide and amino acid levels. The former does not allow\nto account for frameshift translations and up to now, the latter exclusively\naccounts for frameshift translation initiation, not accounting for the length\nof the translation disruption caused by a frameshift.\n  Here, we introduce a new scoring scheme with an algorithm for the pairwise\nalignment of CDS accounting for frameshift translation initiation and length,\nwhile simultaneously accounting for nucleotide and amino acid sequences. We\ncompare the method to other CDS alignment methods based on an application to\nthe comparison of pairs of CDS from homologous \\emph{human}, \\emph{mouse} and\n\\emph{cow} genes of ten mammalian gene families from the Ensembl-Compara\ndatabase. The results show that our method is particularly robust to parameter\nchanges as compared to existing methods. It also appears to be a good\ncompromise, performing well both in the presence and absence of frameshift\ntranslations between the CDS. An implementation of the method is available at\nhttps://github.com/UdeS-CoBIUS/FsePSA.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08809v1', ['Quantitative Methods', 'Genomics'], []]
[u'Stratification of patient trajectories using covariate latent variable\n  models', ['Kieran R. Campbell', 'Christopher Yau'], u'2016-10-27', u'Standard models assign disease progression to discrete categories or stages\nbased on well-characterized clinical markers. However, such a system is\npotentially at odds with our understanding of the underlying biology, which in\nhighly complex systems may support a (near-)continuous evolution of disease\nfrom inception to terminal state. To learn such a continuous disease score one\ncould infer a latent variable from dynamic omics data such as RNA-seq that\ncorrelates with an outcome of interest such as survival time. However, such\nanalyses may be confounded by additional data such as clinical covariates\nmeasured in electronic health records (EHRs). As a solution to this we\nintroduce covariate latent variable models, a novel type of latent variable\nmodel that learns a low-dimensional data representation in the presence of two\n(asymmetric) views of the same data source. We apply our model to TCGA\ncolorectal cancer RNA-seq data and demonstrate how incorporating\nmicrosatellite-instability (MSI) and metastatic status as external covariates\nallows us to identify genes that stratify patients on an immune-response\ntrajectory. Finally, we propose an extension termed Covariate Gaussian Process\nLatent Variable Models for learning nonparametric, nonlinear representations.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08735v1', ['Quantitative Methods', 'Genomics'], []]

[u'Random matrix analysis for gene interaction networks in cancer cells', ['Ayumi Kikkawa'], u'2016-10-27', u'Motivation: The investigation of topological modifications of the gene\ninteraction networks in cancer cells is essential for understanding the\ndesease. We study gene interaction networks in various human cancer cells with\nthe random matrix theory. This study is based on the Cancer Network Galaxy\n(TCNG) database which is the repository of huge gene interactions inferred by\nBayesian network algorithms from 256 microarray experimental data downloaded\nfrom NCBI GEO. The original GEO data are provided by the high-throughput\nmicroarray expression experiments on various human cancer cells. We apply the\nrandom matrix theory to the computationally inferred gene interaction networks\nin TCNG in order to detect the universality in the topology of the gene\ninteraction networks in cancer cells. Results: We found the universal behavior\nin almost one half of the 256 gene interaction networks in TCNG. The\ndistribution of nearest neighbor level spacing of the gene interaction matrix\nbecomes the Wigner distribution when the network is large (condensed), and it\nbehaves as Poisson distribution when the network is smaller. We also observe\nthe transition between the Poisson and the Wigner distributions as the\nthreshold of confidence factor of the gene interactions is shifted. We expect\nthat the random matrix theory provides an effective analytical method for\ninvestigating the huge interaction networks of the various transcripts in\ncancer cells.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08631v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
[u'Functional architecture and global properties of the Corynebacterium\n  glutamicum regulatory network: novel insights from a dataset with a high\n  genomic coverage', ['Julio A. Freyre-Gonzalez', 'Andreas Tauch'], u'2016-10-26', u'Corynebacterium glutamicum is a Gram-positive, anaerobic, rod-shaped soil\nbacterium able to grow on a diversity of carbon sources like sugars and organic\nacids. It is a biotechnological relevant organism because of its highly\nefficient ability to biosynthesize amino acids, such as L-glutamic acid and\nL-lysine. Here, we reconstructed the most complete C. glutamicum regulatory\nnetwork to date and comprehensively analyzed its global organizational\nproperties, systems-level features and functional architecture. Our analyses\nshow the tremendous power of Abasy Atlas to study the functional organization\nof regulatory networks. We created two models of the C. glutamicum regulatory\nnetwork: all-evidences (containing both weak and strong supported interactions,\ngenomic coverage = 73%) and strongly-supported (only accounting for strongly\nsupported evidences, genomic coverage = 71%). Using state-of-the-art\nmethodologies, we prove that power-law behaviors truly govern the connectivity\nand clustering coefficient distributions. We found a non-previously reported\ncircuit motif that we named complex feed-forward motif. We highlighted the\nimportance of feedback loops for the functional architecture, beyond whether\nthey are statistically over-represented or not in the network. We show that the\npreviously reported top-down approach is inadequate to infer the hierarchy\ngoverning a regulatory network because feedback bridges different hierarchical\nlayers, and the top-down approach disregards the presence of intermodular genes\nshaping the integration layer. Our findings all together further support a\ndiamond-shaped, three-layered hierarchy exhibiting some feedback between\nprocessing and coordination layers, which is shaped by four classes of\nsystems-level elements: global regulators, locally autonomous modules, basal\nmachinery and intermodular genes.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08552v1', ['Molecular Networks', 'Genomics'], []]
[u'Large deviations for Gaussian diffusions with delay', ['Robert Azencott', 'Brett Geiger', 'William Ott'], u'2016-10-03', u'Dynamical systems driven by nonlinear delay SDEs with small noise can exhibit\nimportant rare events on long timescales. When there is no delay, classical\nlarge deviations theory quantifies rare events such as escapes from nominally\nstable fixed points. Near such fixed points one can approximate nonlinear delay\nSDEs by linear delay SDEs. Here, we develop a fully explicit large deviations\nframework for (necessarily Gaussian) processes $X_t$ driven by linear delay\nSDEs with small diffusion coefficients. Our approach enables fast numerical\ncomputation of the action functional controlling rare events for $X_t$ and of\nthe most likely paths transiting from $X_0 = p$ to $X_T=q$. Via linear noise\nlocal approximations, we can then compute most likely routes of escape from\nmetastable states for nonlinear delay SDEs. We apply our methodology to the\ndetailed dynamics of a genetic regulatory circuit, namely the co-repressive\ntoggle switch, which may be described by a nonlinear chemical Langevin SDE with\ndelay.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08769v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
