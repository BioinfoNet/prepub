[u'Hamiltonian synaptic sampling in a model for reward-gated network\n  plasticity', ['Zhaofei Yu', 'David Kappel', 'Robert Legenstein', 'Sen Song', 'Feng Chen', 'Wolfgang Maass'], u'2016-06-01', u'Experimental data show that synaptic connections are subject to stochastic\nprocesses, and that neural codes drift on larger time scales. These data\nsuggest to consider besides maximum likelihood learning also sampling models\nfor network plasticity (synaptic sampling), where the current network\nconnectivity and parameter values are viewed as a sample from a Markov chain,\nwhose stationary distribution captures the invariant properties of network\nplasticity. However convergence to this stationary distribution may be rather\nslow if synaptic sampling carries out Langevin sampling. We show here that data\non the molecular basis of synaptic plasticity, specifically on the role of\nCaMKII in its activated form, support a substantially more efficient\nHamiltonian sampling of network configurations. We apply this new conceptual\nand mathematical framework to the analysis of reward-gated network plasticity,\nand show in a concrete example based on experimental data that Hamiltonian\nsampling speeds up the convergence to well-functioning network configurations.\nWe also show that a regulation of the temperature of the sampling process\nprovides a link between reinforcement learning and global network optimization\nthrough simulated annealing.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00157v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

Here we ?rst show that a number of issues in vision may be\naddressed through an analytic expression of the Jacobian of these\nlinear-nonlinear transforms. The particular model analyzed afterwards (an\nextension of [Malo & Simoncelli SPIE 2015]) is illustrative because it consists\nof a cascade of standard linear-nonlinear modules. Each module roughly\ncorresponds to a known psychophysical mechanism: (1) linear spectral\nintegration and nonlinear brightness-from-luminance computation, (2) linear\npooling of local brightness and nonlinear normalization for local contrast\ncomputation, (3) linear frequency selectivity and nonlinear normalization for\nspatial contrast masking, and (4) linear wavelet-like decomposition and\nnonlinear normalization for frequency-dependent masking. Beyond being the\nappropriate technical report with the missing details in [Malo & Simoncelli\nSPIE 2015], the interest of the presented analytic results and numerical\nmethods transcend the particular model because of the ubiquity of the\nlinear-nonlinear structure.\n  Part of this material was presented at MODVIS 2016 (see slides of the\nconference talk in the appendix at the end of this document).', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00144v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

[u'Prediction of miRNA-disease associations with a vector space model', ['Claude Pasquier', 'Julien Gardes'], u'2016-06-01', u'MicroRNAs play critical roles in many physiological processes. Their\ndysregulations are also closely related to the development and progression of\nvarious human diseases, including cancer. Therefore, identifying new microRNAs\nthat are associated with diseases contributes to a better understanding of\npathogenicity mechanisms. MicroRNAs also represent a tremendous opportunity in\nbiotechnology for early diagnosis. To date, several in silico methods have been\ndeveloped to address the issue of microRNA-disease association prediction.\nHowever, these methods have various limitations. In this study, we investigate\nthe hypothesis that information attached to miRNAs and diseases can be revealed\nby distributional semantics. Our basic approach is to represent distributional\ninformation on miRNAs and diseases in a high-dimensional vector space and to\ndefine associations between miRNAs and diseases in terms of their vector\nsimilarity. Cross validations performed on a dataset of known miRNA-disease\nassociations demonstrate the excellent performance of our method. Moreover, the\ncase study focused on breast cancer confirms the ability of our method to\ndiscover new disease-miRNA associations and to identify putative false\nassociations reported in databases.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00309v1', ['Quantitative Methods', 'Molecular Networks'], []]
[u'Clustering with phylogenetic tools in astrophysics', ['Didier Fraix-Burnet'], u'2016-06-01', u'Phylogenetic approaches are finding more and more applications outside the\nfield of biology. Astrophysics is no exception since an overwhelming amount of\nmultivariate data has appeared in the last twenty years or so. In particular,\nthe diversification of galaxies throughout the evolution of the Universe quite\nnaturally invokes phylogenetic approaches. We have demonstrated that Maximum\nParsimony brings useful astrophysical results, and we now proceed toward the\nanalyses of large datasets for galaxies. In this talk I present how we solve\nthe major difficulties for this goal: the choice of the parameters, their\ndiscretization, and the analysis of a high number of objects with an\nunsupervised NP-hard classification technique like cladistics. 1. Introduction\nHow do the galaxy form, and when? How did the galaxy evolve and transform\nthemselves to create the diversity we observe? What are the progenitors to\npresent-day galaxies? To answer these big questions, observations throughout\nthe Universe and the physical modelisation are obvious tools. But between\nthese, there is a key process, without which it would be impossible to extract\nsome digestible information from the complexity of these systems. This is\nclassification. One century ago, galaxies were discovered by Hubble. From\nimages obtained in the visible range of wavelengths, he synthetised his\nobservations through the usual process: classification. With only one parameter\n(the shape) that is qualitative and determined with the eye, he found four\ncategories: ellipticals, spirals, barred spirals and irregulars. This is the\nfamous Hubble classification. He later hypothetized relationships between these\nclasses, building the Hubble Tuning Fork. The Hubble classification has been\nrefined, notably by de Vaucouleurs, and is still used as the only global\nclassification of galaxies. Even though the physical relationships proposed by\nHubble are not retained any more, the Hubble Tuning Fork is nearly always used\nto represent the classification of the galaxy diversity under its new name the\nHubble sequence (e.g. Delgado-Serrano, 2012). Its success is impressive and can\nbe understood by its simplicity, even its beauty, and by the many correlations\nfound between the morphology of galaxies and their other properties. And one\nmust admit that there is no alternative up to now, even though both the Hubble\nclassification and diagram have been recognised to be unsatisfactory. Among the\nmost obvious flaws of this classification, one must mention its monovariate,\nqualitative, subjective and old-fashioned nature, as well as the difficulty to\ncharacterise the morphology of distant galaxies. The first two most significant\nmultivariate studies were by Watanabe et al. (1985) and Whitmore (1984). Since\nthe year 2005, the number of studies attempting to go beyond the Hubble\nclassification has increased largely. Why, despite of this, the Hubble\nclassification and its sequence are still alive and no alternative have yet\nemerged (Sandage, 2005)? My feeling is that the results of the multivariate\nanalyses are not easily integrated into a one-century old practice of modeling\nthe observations. In addition, extragalactic objects like galaxies, stellar\nclusters or stars do evolve. Astronomy now provides data on very distant\nobjects, raising the question of the relationships between those and our\npresent day nearby galaxies. Clearly, this is a phylogenetic problem.\nAstrocladistics 1 aims at exploring the use of phylogenetic tools in\nastrophysics (Fraix-Burnet et al., 2006a,b). We have proved that Maximum\nParsimony (or cladistics) can be applied in astrophysics and provides a new\nexploration tool of the data (Fraix-Burnet et al., 2009, 2012, Cardone \\&\nFraix-Burnet, 2013). As far as the classification of galaxies is concerned, a\nlarger number of objects must now be analysed. In this paper, I', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00235v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], [u'IPAG']]

[u'Environment Identification in Flight using Sparse Approximation of Wing\n  Strain', ['Krithika Manohar', 'Steven L. Brunton', 'J. Nathan Kutz'], u'2016-05-31', u'This paper addresses the problem of identifying different flow environments\nfrom sparse data collected by wing strain sensors. Insects regularly perform\nthis feat using a sparse ensemble of noisy strain sensors on their wing. First,\nwe obtain strain data from numerical simulation of a Manduca sexta hawkmoth\nwing undergoing different flow environments. Our data-driven method learns\nlow-dimensional strain features originating from different aerodynamic\nenvironments using Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) modes in the frequency\ndomain, and leverages compressed sensing and sparse approximation to classify a\nset of strain frequency signatures using a dictionary of POD modes. This\nbio-inspired machine learning architecture for dictionary learning and sparse\nclassification permits fewer costly physical strain sensors while being\nsimultaneously robust to sensor noise. A sensor placement algorithm identifies\nthe frequency samples that best separate the different aerodynamic environments\nin rank-reduced POD feature space. In this manner, sparse and noisy wing strain\ndata can be exploited to robustly identify different aerodynamic environments\nencountered in flight, providing insight into the stereotyped placement of\nneurons that act as strain sensors on a Manduca sexta hawkmoth wing.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00034v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Global optimization, local adaptation and the role of growth in\n  distribution networks', ['Henrik Ronellenfitsch', 'Eleni Katifori'], u'2016-06-01', u'Highly-optimized complex transport networks serve crucial functions in many\nman-made and natural systems such as power grids and plant or animal\nvasculature. Often, the relevant optimization functional is non-convex and\ncharacterized by many local extrema. In general, finding the global, or nearly\nglobal optimum is difficult. In biological systems, it is believed that natural\nselection slowly guides the network towards an optimized state. However,\ngeneral coarse grained models for flow networks with local positive feedback\nrules for the vessel conductivity typically get trapped in low efficiency,\nlocal minima. In this work we show how the growth of the underlying tissue,\ncoupled to the dynamical equations for network development, can drive the\nsystem to a dramatically improved optimal state. This general model provides a\nsurprisingly simple explanation for the appearance of highly optimized\ntransport networks in biology such as leaf and animal vasculature.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00331v1', ['Tissues and Organs'], []]

Asthma\nwas self-reported, while periodontitis, bleeding on probing (BOP), and plaque\nindex were determined by clinical examinations. Results: Using logistic\nregression adjusting for gender, smoking status, age, body mass index, family\nhistory of asthma, and income level, revealed that the odds ratio (OR) of\nasthma for a participant with severe periodontitis was 0.44 (95% confidence\ninterval: 0.27, 0.70) that of a participant with none/mild periodontitis . On\nthe other hand, proportion of BOP sites, and plaque index were not\nstatistically significant. For a participant with severe periodontitis, the OR\nof taking asthma medication was 0.20 (95% confidence interval: 0.09, 0.43) that\nof a participant with none/mild periodontitis. Moreover, proportion of BOP\nsites was statistically associated to use of asthma medication while plaque\nindex still remained non-significant. Conclusion: Participants with severe\nperiodontitis were less likely to have asthma. Stronger evidence of an inverse\nassociation was found when using asthma medication as outcome.

[u'Exploratory Adaptation in Large Random Networks', ['Hallel Schreier', 'Yoav Soen', 'Naama Brenner'], u'2016-06-01', u'The capacity of cells and organisms to respond in a repeatable manner to\nchallenging conditions is limited by a finite number of pre-evolved adaptive\nresponses. Beyond this capacity, exploratory dynamics can provide alternative\nmeans to cope with a much broader array of conditions. At the population level,\nexploration is implemented by mutations and selection over multiple\ngenerations. However, within the lifetime of a single cell,the mechanisms by\nwhich exploratory changes can lead to adaptive phenotypes are still poorly\nunderstood. Here, we address this question by developing a network model of\nexploration in gene regulation. The model we propose demonstrates the\nfeasibility of adapting by temporal exploration. Exploration is initiated by\nfailure to comply with a global constraint and is implemented by random\nsampling of available network configurations. It ceases if and when the system\nconverges to a stable compliance with the constraint. Successful convergence of\nthis process depends crucially on network topology and is most efficient for\nscale-free connectivity, typical of gene regulatory networks. For such\nnetworks, convergence to an adapted phenotype can be achieved without fine\ntuning of initial conditions or other model parameters, thus making it\nplausible for biological implementation.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00101v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
