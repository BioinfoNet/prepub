[u'Amino acid preference against beta sheet through allowing backbone\n  hydration enabled by the presence of cation', ['John N. Sharley'], u'2016-10-03', u'It is known that steric blocking by peptide sidechains of hydrogen bonding,\nHB, between water and peptide groups, PGs, in beta sheets accords with an amino\nacid intrinsic beta sheet preference. The present observations with Quantum\nMolecular Dynamics, QMD, simulation with quantum mechanical treatment of every\nwater molecule solvating a beta sheet that would be transient in nature suggest\nthat this steric blocking is not applicable in a hydrophobic region unless a\ncation is present, so that the amino acid beta sheet preference due to this\nsteric blocking is only effective in the presence of a cation. We observed\nbackbone hydration in a polyalanine and to a lesser extent polyvaline alpha\nhelix without a cation being present, but a cation could increase the strength\nof these HBs.\n  Parallel beta sheets have a greater tendency than antiparallel beta sheets of\nequivalent small size to retain regular structure in solvated QMD, and a 4\nstrand 4 inter-PG HB chain parallel beta sheet was used. Stability was\nreinforced by one surface being polyvaline, which buttressed the opposite\nsurface which was used for experimentation. A single Ca2+ ion was used for\ninvestigation of individual binding events rather than bulk properties. No\ndirect binding between Ca2+ and the PG oxygen was observed in these\nsimulations, but perhaps it occurs at longer time scales as the transient beta\nsheet unfolds.\n  When linear scaling QMD methods that are accurate for peptide resonance,\nResonance-Assisted Hydrogen Bonding and the properties of water become\navailable, more extensive experiments having multiple ions of multiple types\ncould be performed at acceptable computational cost. It important that such\ninvestigations be performed on protein secondary structures rather than model\namides so that sidechain limitation of backbone hydration and hence intrinsic\namino acid propensity is captured.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00375v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]

[u'Stochastic dynamics for adaptation and evolution of microorganisms', ['Sylvain Billiard', 'Pierre Collet', 'Regis Ferriere', 'Sylvie Meleard', 'Viet Chi Tran'], u'2016-10-04', u'We present a modeling framework for the dynamics of a population of\nindividuals with a continuum of traits, who compete for resources and exchange\nhorizontally (transfer) an otherwise vertically inherited trait. Competition\ninfluences individual demographics, affecting population size, which feeds back\non the dynamics of transfer. This feedback is captured with a stochastic\nindividual-based model, from which a deterministic approximation for large\npopulations is derived. The limiting process is the solution of a non linear\nintegro-differential equation. When there are only two different traits, the\nequation reduces to a non-standard two-dimensional dynamical system. We show\nhow crucial the forms of the transfer rates are for the long-term behavior of\nits solutions. For density-dependent transfer rates, the equilibria are those\nof Lotka-Volterra systems, but horizontal transfer may revert the change of\nevolution. Frequency-dependence or more general transfert rates reveal new\nphase diagrams. The interaction between horizontal transfer and competition\nmakes for example possible the stable (or bi-stable) polymorphic maintenance of\ndeleterious traits (including costly plasmids). For an initially rare trait, we\ndescribe the dynamics of invasion and fixation and compute the invasion\nprobabilities. Horizontal transfer can have a major impact on the distribution\nof the mutational effects that are fixed. This allows us to consider then the\nimpact of horizontal transfer on evolution. Our model provides a basis for a\ngeneral theory of the influence of horizontal transfer on eco-evolutionary\ndynamics and adaptation.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00983v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], [u'UMR 8198', u'CPHT', u'CNRS UMR 7625,', u'CMAP', u'LPP']]

[u'Efficient estimation of the maximum metabolic productivity of batch\n  systems', ['Peter C. St. John', 'Michael F. Crowley', 'Yannick J. Bomble'], u'2016-10-04', u'Production of chemicals from engineered organisms in a batch culture involves\nan inherent trade-off between productivity, yield, and titer. Existing\nstrategies for strain design typically focus on designing mutations that\nachieve the highest yield possible while maintaining growth viability. While\nthese methods are computationally tractable, an optimum productivity could be\nachieved by a dynamic strategy in which the intracellular division of resources\nis permitted to change with time. New methods for the design and implementation\nof dynamic microbial processes, both computational and experimental, have\ntherefore been explored to maximize productivity. However, solving for the\noptimal metabolic behavior under the assumption that all fluxes in the cell are\nfree to vary is a challenging numerical task. This work presents an efficient\nmethod for the calculation of a maximum theoretical productivity of a batch\nculture system using a dynamic optimization framework. This metric is analogous\nto the maximum theoretical yield, a measure that is well established in the\nmetabolic engineering literature and whose use helps guide strain and pathway\nselection. The proposed method follows traditional assumptions of dynamic flux\nbalance analysis: (1) that internal metabolite fluxes are governed by a\npseudo-steady state, and (2) that external metabolite fluxes are dynamically\nbounded. The optimization is achieved via collocation on finite elements, and\naccounts explicitly for an arbitrary number of flux changes. The method can be\nfurther extended to explicitly solve for the trade-off curve between maximum\nproductivity and yield. We demonstrate the method on succinate production in\ntwo common microbial hosts, Escherichia coli and Actinobacillus succinogenes,\nrevealing that nearly optimal yields and productivities can be achieved with\nonly two discrete flux stages.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01114v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Sources of false positives and false negatives in the STATCHECK\n  algorithm: Reply to Nuijten et al. (2015)', ['Thomas Schmidt'], u'2016-10-04', u'STATCHECK is an R algorithm designed to scan papers automatically for\ninconsistencies between test statistics and their associated p values (Nuijten\net al., 2015). The goal of this comment is to point out an important and\nwell-documented flaw in this busily applied algorithm: It cannot handle\ncorrected p values. As a result, statistical tests applying appropriate\ncorrections to the p value (e.g., for multiple tests, post-hoc tests,\nviolations of assumptions, etc.) are likely to be flagged as reporting\ninconsistent statistics, whereas papers omitting necessary corrections are\ncertified as correct. The STATCHECK algorithm is thus valid for only a subset\nof scientific papers, and conclusions about the quality of statistical reports\nshould never be based solely on this program.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01010v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Predict genome-scale fluxes based solely on enzyme abundance by a novel\n  Hyper-Cube Shrink Algorithm', ['Zhengwei Xie', 'Tianyu Zhang', 'Qi Ouyang'], u'2016-10-04', u'One of the long-expected goals of genome-scale metabolic modeling is to\nevaluate the influence of the perturbed enzymes to the flux distribution. Both\nordinary differential equation (ODE) models and the constraint-based models,\nlike Flux balance analysis (FBA), lack of the room of performing metabolic\ncontrol analysis (MCA) for large-scale networks. In this study, we developed a\nHyper-Cube Shrink Algorithm (HCSA) to incorporate the enzymatic properties to\nthe FBA model by introducing a pseudo reaction constrained by enzymatic\nparameters. Our algorithm was able to handle not only prediction of knockout\nstrains but also strains with quantitative adjustment of expression level or\nactivity. We first demonstrate the concept by applying HCSA to a simplest\nthree-node network. Then we validate its prediction by comparing with ODE and\nwith a synthetic network in Saccharomyces cerevisiae producing voilacein and\nanalogues. Finally we show its capability of predicting the flux distribution\nin genome-scale networks by applying it to the sporulation in yeast.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00825v1', ['Quantitative Methods', 'Molecular Networks'], []]
[u'Patterns of Selection of Human Movements II: Movement Limits, Mechanical\n  Energy, and Very Slow Walking Gaits', ['Stuart Hagler'], u'2016-10-03', u'The biomechanics of the human body allow humans a range of possible ways of\nexecuting movements to attain specific goals. This range of movement is limited\nby a number of mechanical, biomechanical, or cognitive constraints. Shifts in\nthese limits result in changes available possible movements from which a\nsubject can select and can affect which movements a subject selects. Therefore\nby understanding the limits on the range of movement we can come to a better\nunderstanding of declines in movement performance due to disease or aging. In\nthis project, we look at how models for the limits on the range of movement can\nbe derived in a principled manner from a model of the movement. Using the\nexample of normal walking gaits, we develop a lower limit on the avg. walking\nspeed by examining the process by which the body restores mechanical energy\nlost during walking, and we develop an upper limit on the avg. step length by\nexamining the forces the body can exert doing external mechanical work, in this\ncase, pulling a cart. Making slight changes to the model for normal walking\ngaits, we develop a model of very slow walking gaits with avg. walking speeds\nbelow the lower limit on normal walking gaits but that also has a lower limit\non the avg. walking speed. We note that the lowest avg. walking speeds observed\nclinically fall into the range of very slow walking gaits so defined, and argue\nthat forms of bipedal locomotion with still lower speeds should be considered\ndistinct from walking gaits.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00763v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Noise Filtering and Prediction in Biological Signaling Networks', ['David Hathcock', 'James Sheehy', 'Casey Weisenberger', 'Efe Ilker', 'Michael Hinczewski'], u'2016-10-04', u'Information transmission in biological signaling circuits has often been\ndescribed using the metaphor of a noise filter. Cellular systems need accurate,\nreal-time data about their environmental conditions, but the biochemical\nreaction networks that propagate, amplify, and process signals work with noisy\nrepresentations of that data. Biology must implement strategies that not only\nfilter the noise, but also predict the current state of the environment based\non information delayed due to the finite speed of chemical signaling. The idea\nof a biochemical noise filter is actually more than just a metaphor: we\ndescribe recent work that has made an explicit mathematical connection between\nsignaling fidelity in cellular circuits and the classic theories of optimal\nnoise filtering and prediction that began with Wiener, Kolmogorov, Shannon, and\nBode. This theoretical framework provides a versatile tool, allowing us to\nderive analytical bounds on the maximum mutual information between the\nenvironmental signal and the real-time estimate constructed by the system. It\nhelps us understand how the structure of a biological network, and the response\ntimes of its components, influences the accuracy of that estimate.

[u'Modelling autophagy selectivity by receptor clustering on peroxisomes', ['Aidan I Brown', 'Andrew D Rutenberg'], u'2016-10-03', u'When subcellular organelles are degraded by autophagy, typically some, but\nnot all, of each targeted organelle type are degraded. Autophagy selectivity\nmust not only select the correct type of organelle, but must discriminate\nbetween individual organelles of the same kind. In the context of peroxisomes,\nwe use computational models to explore the hypothesis that physical clustering\nof autophagy receptor proteins on the surface of each organelle provides an\nappropriate all-or-none signal for degradation. The pexophagy receptor proteins\nNBR1 and p62 are well characterized, though only NBR1 is essential for\npexophagy (Deosaran {\\em et al.}, 2013). Extending earlier work by addressing\nthe initial nucleation of NBR1 clusters on individual peroxisomes, we find that\nlarger peroxisomes nucleate NBR1 clusters first and lose them due to\ncompetitive coarsening last, resulting in significant size-selectivity\nfavouring large peroxisomes. This effect can explain the increased catalase\nsignal that results from experimental siRNA inhibition of p62. We also consider\nreceptor cluster formation on individual peroxisomes with enhanced levels of\nubiquitin and find that size-selectivity, but not cluster formation, is\nsuppressed. Thus, our selectivity mechanism does not hinder selection of\nindividual damaged organelles via enhanced ubiquitination. NBR1 cluster\nformation provides a viable physical mechanism for all-or-none substrate\nselectivity in pexophagy.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00766v1', ['Subcellular Processes'], []]
