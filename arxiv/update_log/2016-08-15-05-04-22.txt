Here we present a mesoscopic model for double stranded DNA (dsDNA)\nat the single nucleotide level which retains the characteristic helical\nstructure, while being able to simulate large molecules -- up to a million base\npairs -- for time-scales which are relevant to physiological processes. This is\nmade possible by an efficient and highly-parallelised implementation of the\nmodel which we discuss here. We compare the behaviour of our model with single\nmolecule experiments where dsDNA is manipulated by external forces or torques.\nWe also present some results on the kinetics of denaturation of linear DNA.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03722v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Unsupervised feature learning from finite data by message passing:\n  discontinuous versus continuous phase transition', ['Haiping Huang', 'Taro Toyoizumi'], u'2016-08-12', u'Unsupervised neural network learning extracts hidden features from unlabeled\ntraining data. This is used as a pretraining step for further supervised\nlearning in deep networks. Hence, understanding unsupervised learning is of\nfundamental importance. Here, we study the unsupervised learning from a finite\nnumber of data, based on the restricted Boltzmann machine learning. Our study\ninspires an efficient message passing algorithm to infer the hidden feature,\nand estimate the entropy of candidate features consistent with the data. Our\nanalysis reveals that the learning requires only a few data if the feature is\nsalient and extensively many if the feature is weak. Moreover, the entropy of\ncandidate features monotonically decreases with data size and becomes negative\n(i.e., entropy crisis) before the message passing becomes unstable, suggesting\na discontinuous phase transition. In terms of convergence time of the message\npassing algorithm, the unsupervised learning exhibits an easy-hard-easy\nphenomenon as the training data size increases. The hard region may be related\nto the discontinuous phase transition. All these properties are reproduced in\nan approximate Hopfield model, with an exception that the entropy crisis is\nabsent (continuous phase transition). This key difference is also confirmed in\na handwritten digits dataset. This study deepens our understanding of\nunsupervised learning from a finite number of data, and may provide insights\ninto its role in training deep networks.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03714v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Modulation of synaptic plasticity by glutamatergic gliotransmission: A\n  modeling study', ['Maurizio De Pitta', 'Nicolas Brunel'], u'2016-08-12', u'Glutamatergic gliotransmission, that is the release of glutamate from\nperisynaptic astrocyte processes in an activity-dependent manner, has emerged\nas a potentially crucial signaling pathway for regulation of synaptic\nplasticity, yet its modes of expression and function in vivo remain unclear.\nHere, we focus on two experimentally well-identified gliotransmitter patwhays:\n(i)~modulations of synaptic release and (ii)~postynaptic slow inward currents\nmediated by glutamate released from astrocytes, and investigate their possible\nfunctional relevance on synaptic plasticity in a biophysical model of an\nastrocyte-regulated synapse. Our model predicts that both pathways could\nprofoundly affect both short- and long-term plasticity. In particular,\nactivity-dependent glutamate release from astrocytes, could dramatically change\nspike-timing--dependent plasticity, turning potentiation into depression (and\nvice versa) for the same protocol.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03655v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

However, it remains unknown\nwhether structural brain networks are similarly refined during development,\npotentially allowing for improvements in executive function. In a sample of 882\nparticipants (ages 8-22) who underwent diffusion imaging as part of the\nPhiladelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, we demonstrate that structural network\nmodules become more segregated with age, with weaker connections between\nmodules and stronger connections within modules. Evolving modular topology\nfacilitated network integration, driven by age-related strengthening of hub\nedges that were present both within and between modules. Critically, both\nmodular segregation and network integration were associated with enhanced\nexecutive performance, and mediated the improvement of executive functioning\nwith age. Together, results delineate a process of structural network\nmaturation that supports executive function in youth.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03619v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

However, recent techniques have not been\nsystematically evaluated using consistent outcome measures. Here, we provide a\nsystematic evaluation of 12 commonly used confound regression methods in 193\nyoung adults. Specifically, we compare methods according to three benchmarks,\nincluding the residual relationship between motion and connectivity,\ndistance-dependent effects of motion on connectivity, and additional degrees of\nfreedom lost in confound regression. Our results delineate two clear trade-offs\namong methods. First, methods that include global signal regression minimize\nthe relationship between connectivity and motion, but unmask distance-dependent\nartifact. In contrast, censoring methods mitigate both motion artifact and\ndistance-dependence, but use additional degrees of freedom. Taken together,\nthese results emphasize the heterogeneous efficacy of proposed methods, and\nsuggest that different confound regression strategies may be appropriate in the\ncontext of specific scientific goals.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03616v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

[u'Stochastic competitive exclusion leads to a cascade of species\n  extinctions', ['Jose A. Capitan', 'Sara Cuenda', 'David Alonso'], u'2016-08-11', u'Community ecology has traditionally relied on the competitive exclusion\nprinciple, a piece of common wisdom in conceptual frameworks developed to\ndescribe species assemblages. Key concepts in community ecology, such as\nlimiting similarity and niche partitioning, are based on competitive exclusion.\nHowever, this classical paradigm in ecology relies on implications derived from\nsimple, deterministic models. Here we show how the predictions of a symmetric,\ndeterministic model about the way extinctions proceed can be utterly different\nfrom the results derived from the same model when ecological drift (demographic\nstochasticity) is explicitly considered. Using analytical approximations to the\nsteady-state conditional probabilities for assemblages with two and three\nspecies, we demonstrate that stochastic competitive exclusion leads to a\ncascade of extinctions, whereas the symmetric, deterministic model predicts a\nmultiple collapse of species. To test the robustness of our results, we have\nstudied the effect of environmental stochasticity and relaxed the species\nsymmetry assumption. Our conclusions highlight the crucial role of\nstochasticity when deriving reliable theoretical predictions for species\ncommunity assembly.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03594v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

[u'Inferring unknown biological function by integration of GO annotations\n  and gene expression data', ['Guillermo Leale', 'Ariel Baya', 'Diego Milone', 'Pablo Granitto', 'Georgina Stegmayer'], u'2016-08-12', u'Characterizing genes with semantic information is an important process\nregarding the description of gene products. In spite that complete genomes of\nmany organisms have been already sequenced, the biological functions of all of\ntheir genes are still unknown. Since experimentally studying the functions of\nthose genes, one by one, would be unfeasible, new computational methods for\ngene functions inference are needed. We present here a novel computational\napproach for inferring biological function for a set of genes with previously\nunknown function, given a set of genes with well-known information. This\napproach is based on the premise that genes with similar behaviour should be\ngrouped together. This is known as the guilt-by-association principle. Thus, it\nis possible to take advantage of clustering techniques to obtain groups of\nunknown genes that are co-clustered with genes that have well-known semantic\ninformation (GO annotations). Meaningful knowledge to infer unknown semantic\ninformation can therefore be provided by these well-known genes. We provide a\nmethod to explore the potential function of new genes according to those\ncurrently annotated. The results obtained indicate that the proposed approach\ncould be a useful and effective tool when used by biologists to guide the\ninference of biological functions for recently discovered genes. Our work sets\nan important landmark in the field of identifying unknown gene functions\nthrough clustering, using an external source of biological input.
