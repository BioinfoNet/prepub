This theory accounts\nfor permeation in the channels studied to date in a wide range of solutions.\nInterestingly, the theory works because the shape of the electric field is a\nsensitive function of experimental conditions, e.g., ion concentration. Rate\nconstants for flux are sensitive functions of ionic concentration because the\nfixed charge of the channel protein is shielded by the ions in an near it.

[u'Parallel ICA reveals linked patterns of structural damage and fMRI\n  language task activation in chronic post-stroke aphasia', ['Joseph C. Griffis', 'Rodolphe Nenert', 'Jane B. Allendorfer', 'Jerzy P. Szaflarski'], u'2016-10-13', u'Structural and functional MRI studies of patients with post-stroke language\ndeficits have contributed substantially to our understanding of how\ncognitive-behavioral impairments relate to the location of structural damage\nand to the activation of surviving brain regions during language processing,\nrespectively. However, very little is known about how inter-patient variability\nin language task activation relates to variability in the structures affected\nby stroke. Here, we used parallel independent component analysis (pICA) to\ncharacterize links between patterns of structural damage and patterns of\nfunctional MRI activation during semantic decisions. The pICA analysis revealed\na significant association between a lesion component featuring damage to left\nposterior temporo-parietal cortex and the underlying deep white matter and an\nfMRI component featuring (1) heightened activation in a primarily right\nhemispheric network of frontal, temporal, and parietal regions, and (2) reduced\nactivation in areas associated with the semantic network activated by healthy\ncontrols. Stronger loading parameters on both the lesion and fMRI activation\ncomponents were associated with poorer language test performance. Fiber\ntracking suggests that lesions affecting the left posterior temporo-parietal\ncortex and deep white matter may lead to the simultaneous disruption of\nmultiple long-range structural pathways connecting distal language areas.\nDamage to the left posterior temporo-parietal cortex and underlying white\nmatter may (1) impede the language task-driven recruitment of canonical left\nhemispheric language and other areas (e.g. the right anterior temporal lobe and\ndefault mode regions) that likely support residual language function after\nstroke, and (2) lead to the compensatory recruitment of right hemispheric\nfronto-temporo-parietal networks for tasks requiring semantic processing.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04201v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

[u'Modeling sexual selection in T\xfangara frog and rationality of mate\n  choice', ['Esteban Vargas', 'Camilo Sanabria'], u'2016-10-13', u'The males of the specie of frogs Engystomops pustulosus produce simple and\ncom- plex calls to lure females, as a way of Intersexual selection. Complex\ncalls lead males to a greater reproductive success than simple calls do.\nHowever, the complex calls are also more attractive to the main predator of\nthese amphibians, the bat Trachops cirrhosus. Therefore, as M. Ryan suggests,\nthe complexity of the calls let the frogs keep a trade off between reproductive\nsuccess and predation. In this paper, we first propose to model the proportion\nof simple to complex calls as a symmetric game of two strategies. We also\npropose a model with three strategies (simple callers, complex callers and\nquiet males), where we assess the effect of a male that keeps quiet and\nintercepts females, which would play a role of Intrasexual selection. We\nanalyze the stable points of the replicator equations of the models that we\npropose. Under the assumption that the decision of the males takes into account\nthis trade off between reproductive success and predation, our model reproduces\nthe observed behavior reported in the literature with minimal assumption on the\nparameters. From the three strategies model, we verify that the quiet strategy\ncould only coexists with the simple and complex strategies as long as the rate\nat which quiet males intercept females is high. We conclude that the\nreproductive strategy of the male frog Engystomops pustulosus is rational.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03930v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Prediction of Influenza B Vaccine Effectiveness from Sequence Data', ['Yidan Pan', 'Michael W.

Human influenza epidemics are caused by types A and B, with\nroughly 25% of human cases due to influenza B. Influenza B is a single-stranded\nRNA virus with a high mutation rate, and both prior immune history and\nvaccination put significant pressure on the virus to evolve. Due to the high\nrate of viral evolution, the influenza B vaccine component of the annual\ninfluenza vaccine is updated, roughly every other year in recent years. To\npredict when an update to the vaccine is needed, an estimate of expected\nvaccine effectiveness against a range of viral strains is required. We here\nintroduce a method to measure antigenic distance between the influenza B\nvaccine and circulating viral strains. The measure correlates well with\neffectiveness of the influenza B component of the annual vaccine in humans\nbetween 1979 and 2014. We discuss how this measure of antigenic distance may be\nused in the context of annual influenza vaccine design and prediction of\nvaccine effectiveness.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03915v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

Critical point theory is general, and recently it has\nproved to be the most effective way of describing protein networks that have\nevolved towards nearly perfect functionality in given environments\n(self-organized criticality). Evolutionary patterns are governed by common\nscaling principles, which can be quantified using scales that have been\ndeveloped bioinformatically by studying thousands of PDB structures.

Panfilov'], u'2016-10-12', u'Nonlinear waves of the reaction-diffusion (RD) type occur in many biophysical\nsystems, including the heart, where they initiate cardiac contraction. Such\nwaves can form vortices called scroll waves, which result in the onset of\nlife-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. The dynamics of scroll waves is affected\nby the presence of inhomogeneities, which, in a very general way, can be of\n\\textit{(i)} ionic type, i.e., they affect the reaction part, or \\textit{(ii)}\nconduction type, i.e., they affect the diffusion part of an RD equation. We\ndemostrate, for the first time, by using a state-of-the-art, anatomically\nrealistic model of the pig heart, how differences in the geometrical and\nbiophysical nature of such inhomogeneities can influence scroll-wave dynamics\nin different ways. Our study reveals that conduction-type inhomogeneities\nbecome increasingly important at small length scales, i.e., in the case of\nmultiple, randomly distributed, obstacles in space at the cellular scale\n($0.2-0.4{\\rm mm}$). Such configurations can lead to scroll-wave break up. In\ncontrast, ionic inhomogeneities, affect scroll-wave dynamics significantly at\nlarge length scales, when these inhomogeneities are localized in space at the\ntissue level ($5-10$ mm). In such configurations, these inhomogeneities can (a)\nattract scroll waves, by pinning them to the heterogeneity, or (b) lead to\nscroll-wave breakup.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03866v1', ['Tissues and Organs'], []]
[u'New Insights into Initiation of Colon and Intestinal Cancer: The\n  Significance of Central Stem Cells in the Crypt', ['Ali Mahdipour Shirayeh', 'Leili Shahriyari'], u'2016-10-09', u'Rapidly dividing tissues, like intestinal crypts, are frequently chosen to\ninvestigate the process of tumor initiation, because of their high rate of\nmutations. To study the interplay between normal and mutant as well as immortal\ncells in the human colon or intestinal crypt, we developed a 4-compartmental\nstochastic model for cell dynamics based on current discoveries. Recent studies\nof the intestinal crypt have revealed the existence of two stem cell groups.\nTherefore, our model incorporates two stem cell groups (central stem cells\n(CeSCs) and border stem cells (BSCs)), plus one compartment for transit\namplifying (TA) cells and one compartment of fully differentiated (FD) cells.\nHowever, it can be easily modified to have only one stem cell group. We find\nthat the worst-case scenario occurs when CeSCs are mutated, or an immortal cell\narises in the TA or FD compartments. The probability that the progeny of a\nsingle advantageous CeSC mutant will take over the entire crypt is more than\n$0.2$, and one immortal cell always causes all FD cells to become\nimmortals.Moreover, when CeSCs are either mutants or wild-type (w.t.)\nindividuals, their progeny will take over the entire crypt in less than 100\ndays if there is no immortal cell. Unexpectedly, if the CeSCs are wild-type,\nthen non-immortal mutants with higher fitness are washed out faster than those\nwith lower fitness. Therefore, we suggest one potential treatment for colon\ncancer might be replacing or altering the CeSCs with the normal stem cells.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04089v1', ['Tissues and Organs'], []]
