[u'Variational approximation of molecular kinetics from short\n  off-equilibrium simulations', ['Hao Wu', 'Feliks Nuske', 'Fabian Paul', 'Stefan Klus', 'Peter Koltai', 'Frank Noe'], u'2016-10-20', u'Markov state models (MSMs) and Master equation models are popular approaches\nto approximate molecular kinetics, equilibria, metastable states, and reaction\ncoordinates in terms of a state space discretization usually obtained by\nclustering. Recently, a powerful generalization of MSMs has been introduced,\nthe variational approach of conformation dynamics (VAC) and its special case\nthe time-lagged independent component analysis (TICA), which allow us to\napproximate molecular kinetics and reaction coordinates by linear combinations\nof smooth basis functions or order parameters. While MSMs can be learned from\ntrajectories whose starting points are not sampled from an equilibrium\nensemble, TICA and VAC have as yet not enjoyed this property, and thus previous\nTICA/VAC estimates have been strongly biased when used with ensembles of short\ntrajectories. Here, we employ Koopman operator theory and ideas from dynamic\nmode decomposition (DMD) to show how TICA/VAC can be used to estimate the\nunbiased equilibrium distribution from short-trajectory data and further this\nresult in order to construct unbiased estimators for expectations, covariance\nmatrices, TICA/VAC eigenvectors, relaxation timescales, and reaction\ncoordinates.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06773v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Noise-robust modes of the retinal population code geometrically\n  correspond with "ridges"', ['Adrianna R. Loback', 'Jason S. Prentice', 'Mark L. Ioffe', 'Michael J. Berry II'], u'2016-10-21', u'Throughout the brain, local circuits encode information using large\npopulations of neurons, yet the structure of this population code remains\npoorly understood. Previous studies applying the maximum entropy principle to\nretinal multi-electrode array data have shown that the joint probability\ndistribution of population responses is proliferated by local maxima, which\nrepresents a form of clustering of visual stimuli into a discrete set of\ncategories. However, these studies focused on responses to highly repeated\nstimuli. Another recent study using a hidden Markov model approach likewise\nfound that ganglion cell population activity partitioned into noise-robust\nclusters. Here, we investigate the relationship between the clusters found\nusing these two fundamentally different modeling approaches. We first\ndemonstrate that local maxima in the probability landscape result from the\nrepeat structure of the stimulus ensemble, and are absent in the more\nrealistic, non-repeated stimulus regime. Nonetheless, we show that structure is\nstill present in the non-repeated stimulus regime in the form of what we call\n"soft local maxima," which are local maxima within the subspace of all neural\nactivity states that are restricted to have the same spike count. Using a novel\nnumerical approach, we show that soft local maxima are organized into a\nreliable sequence across the different spike count levels, which altogether has\nthe geometry of a "ridge." These ridges closely corresponded with the clusters\nformulated by the hidden Markov model, and moreover with neuron "communities,"\nin the sense defined in computer science. These findings suggest a unified\ndescription of the retinal population code across different stimulus repeat\nstatistics, and suggest that ridges or communities may be an important feature\nof the output population activity extracted by visual processing areas\ndownstream of the retina.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06886v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

Therefore, the Amsterdam IADL\nQuestionnaire (A-IADL-Q) was developed: a 70-item proxy-based tool with good\npsychometric properties. We aimed to design a short version whilst preserving\nits psychometric quality. METHODS: Study partners of subjects (n=1326), ranging\nfrom cognitively normal to dementia subjects, completed the original A-IADL-Q.\nWe selected the short version items using a stepwise procedure combining\nmissing data, Item Response Theory and input from respondents and experts. We\ninvestigated internal consistency, correspondence with the original version and\ndifferences in IADL scores between diagnostic groups across the dementia\nspectrum. RESULTS: We selected 32 items covering the entire spectrum of IADL\nfunctioning. Internal consistency (.981) and correspondence with the original\nversion (.976) were high. IADL impairment scores increased from normal\ncognition to dementia. DISCUSSION: The A-IADL-Q Short Version (A-IADL-Q-SV) is\na concise measure of functional decline.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06762v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Low-Rank Correlations in Heterogeneous Neural Circuits', ['Andrea K. Barreiro', 'Cheng Ly'], u'2016-10-20', u'A central question in neuroscience is to understand how firing patterns are\nused to transmit information. Theoretical work shows us that the entire\ndistribution of spiking statistics (such as firing rates) across the population\nwill affect common measures of coding (such as Fisher information). These\nstatistics will be affected by neuronal diversity, which is widely observed in\nthe nervous system; however, many theoretical studies of spiking statistics do\nnot include this feature.\n  Here, we study the population distribution of first- and second-order spiking\nstatistics of recurrently coupled excitatory-inhibitory spiking networks with\nconductance-based synapses. We systematically compare networks with and without\nintrinsic heterogeneity (modeled by threshold variation), and in different\nfiring regimes. We found that with stronger excitatory coupling, low-rank\nstructure emerged in the correlation matrix. This structure was related to a\npositive relationship between pairwise correlations and firing rates, which\nemerged in this firing regime. To explain these findings, we used linear\nresponse theory to predict the full correlation matrix and to decompose\ncorrelations in terms of graph motifs. We then used this decomposition to\nexplain why covariation of correlations with firing rate --- a relationship\npreviously explained in common input-driven feedforward networks --- emerges in\nsome recurrent networks but not in others.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06598v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

We performed a systemic review with the aim to have a better\nunderstanding of DS's prevalence in general population. The results showed the\nprevalence of DS is very gender specific and age specific. Both women and men\nhave few DS before 50 years old, after 50 years old both women and men start to\ndevelop DS, with women having a faster developing rate than men. For elderly\nChinese (>=65 yrs, mean age: 72.5 yrs), large population based studies\n(MsOS(Hong Kong) and MrOS (Hong Kong), females n=2000 and males n=2000) showed\nDS prevalence was for 25.0% for women and 19.1% for men, and the prevalence F:M\n(women:men) ratio was 1.3:1. The published data (MsOS(USA) and MrOS(USA)\nstudies) seem to show elderly Caucasian American has a higher DS prevalence,\nbeing approximately 60-70% higher than elderly Chinese; however the prevalence\nF:M ratio was similar to elderly Chinese population. Patient data showed female\npatients more often received treatment than men; and preliminary data show the\nratio of numbers of female patients received treatment compared with men did\nnot differ between Northeast Asians (Chinese, Japanese, and Korean) and\nEuropean and American Caucasians, being around 2:1 in elderly population. The\nexisting data also suggest that menopause may be a contributing factor for the\naccelerated DS development in post-menopausal", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06608v1', ['Other', 'Tissues and Organs'], []]
[u'Morphological and Biochemical Adaptive Changes Associated With A\n  Short-period Starvation of Adult Male Japanese Quail (Coturnix japonica)', ['Yasser A. Ahmed', 'Soha A. Soliman', 'Mohammed Abdelsabour-Khalaf'], u'2016-10-06', u'Background The morphological and biochemical impact of a short-period of\nstarvation on Japanese quail was investigated. Materials and methods Ten adult\nmale Japanese quail were divided into two groups; control fed and starved. The\ncontrol-fed group was offered food and water ad libitum and the starved group\nwas subjected to a short-period of food deprivation. After 2.5 days, the serum\nwas obtained and different parameters including the total protein, AST, ALT,\ntriglyceride, HDL, LDL, creatinine and urea were assessed. Gastrointestinal\ntract, stomach and liver were excised and their masses were estimated. Paraffin\nand resin embedded sections from the proventriculus, gizzard, liver, duodenum,\nkidney and pancreas were examined with a light microscopy. Results Significant\ndecreases in the masses of body, gastrointestinal tract, stomach and liver of\nthe starved group were recorded. The liver and duodenum were the most affected\norgans. The liver showed depletion of glycogen, vacuolation, hyperemia and\ncellular infiltrations. Duodenal villi showed degenerative changes in lamina\nepithelialis and cellular infiltrations in the lamina propria. Biochemical\nanalysis revealed a decreased level of total protein, AST and ALT, increased\ncholesterol, triglycerides and LDL, and unchanged HDL, urea and creatinine by\nstarvation. Conclusion The current study described in details the effect of\nshort time starvation on quail organs. Time-point adaptive responses of male\nquail to starvation and refeeding on quail organs will be investigated in\nfuture studies.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06606v1', ['Tissues and Organs'], [u'Department of Histology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, South Valley University, 83523 Qena, Egypt', u'Department of Anatomy and Embryology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, South Valley University, 83523 Qena, Egypt']]
[u'Evaluating the stoichiometric and energetic constraints of\n  cyanobacterial diurnal growth', ['Alexandra-M. Reimers', 'Henning Knoop', 'Alexander Bockmayr', 'Ralf Steuer'], u'2016-10-21', u"Cyanobacteria are an integral part of the Earth's biogeochemical cycles and a\npromising resource for the synthesis of renewable bioproducts from atmospheric\nCO2 . Growth and metabolism of cyanobacteria are inherently tied to the diurnal\nrhythm of light availability. As yet, however, insight into the stoichiometric\nand energetic constraints of cyanobacterial diurnal growth is limited. Here, we\ndevelop a computational platform to evaluate the optimality of diurnal\nphototrophic growth using a high-quality genome-scale metabolic reconstruction\nof the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942. We formulate\nphototrophic growth as a self-consistent autocatalytic process and evaluate the\nresulting time-dependent resource allocation problem using constraint-based\nanalysis. Based on a narrow and well defined set of parameters, our approach\nresults in an ab initio prediction of growth properties over a full diurnal\ncycle. In particular, our approach allows us to study the optimality of\nmetabolite partitioning during diurnal growth. The cyclic pattern of glycogen\naccumulation, an emergent property of the model, has timing characteristics\nthat are shown to be a trade-off between conflicting cellular objectives. The\napproach presented here provides insight into the time-dependent resource\nallocation problem of phototrophic diurnal growth and may serve as a general\nframework to evaluate the optimality of metabolic strategies that evolved in\nphotosynthetic organisms under diurnal conditions.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06859v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
