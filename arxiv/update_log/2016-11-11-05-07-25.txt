[u'Mahalanobis Distance for Class Averaging of Cryo-EM Images', ['Tejal Bhamre', 'Zhizhen Zhao', 'Amit Singer'], u'2016-11-10', u'Single particle reconstruction (SPR) from cryo-electron microscopy (EM) is a\ntechnique in which the 3D structure of a molecule needs to be determined from\nits contrast transfer function (CTF) affected, noisy 2D projection images taken\nat unknown viewing directions. One of the main challenges in cryo-EM is the\ntypically low signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the acquired images. 2D\nclassification of images, followed by class averaging, improves the SNR of the\nresulting averages, and is used for selecting particles from micrographs and\nfor inspecting the particle images. We introduce a new affinity measure, akin\nto the Mahalanobis distance, to compare cryo-EM images belonging to different\ndefocus groups. The new similarity measure is employed to detect similar\nimages, thereby leading to an improved algorithm for class averaging. We\nevaluate the performance of the proposed class averaging procedure on synthetic\ndatasets, obtaining state of the art classification.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03193v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Measurement of Anticipative Power of a Retina by Predictive Information', ['Kevin Sean Chen', 'Chun-Chung Chen', 'C. K. Chan'], u'2016-11-10', u'The predictive properties of a retina are studied by measuring the mutual\ninformation (MI) between its stimulation and the corresponding firing rates\nwhile it is being probed by a train of short pulses with stochastic intervals.\nFeatures of the measured MI at various time shifts between the stimulation and\nthe response are used to characterize the predictive properties of the retina.\nBy varying the statistical properties of the pulse train, our experiments show\nthat a retina has the ability to predict future events of the stimulation if\nthe information rate of the stimulation is low enough. Also, this predictive\nproperty of the retina occurs at a time scale similar to the well established\nanticipative phenomenon of omitted stimulus response in a retina. Furthermore,\na retina can make use of its predictive ability to distinguish between time\nseries created by an Ornstein--Uhlenbeck and a hidden Markovian process.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03441v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Uncertainty in phylogenetic tree estimates', ['Amy Willis', 'Rayna C. Bell'], u'2016-11-10', u'Estimating phylogenetic trees is an important problem in evolutionary\nbiology, environmental policy and medicine. Although trees are estimated, their\nuncertainties are discarded by mathematicians working in tree space. Here we\nexplicitly model the multivariate uncertainty of tree estimates. We consider\nboth the cases where uncertainty information arises extrinsically (through\ncovariate information) and intrinsically (through the tree estimates\nthemselves). The importance of accounting for tree uncertainty in tree space is\ndemonstrated in two case studies. In the first instance, differences between\ngene trees are small relative to their uncertainties, while in the second, the\ndifferences are relatively large. Our main goal is visualization of tree\nuncertainty, and we demonstrate advantages of our method with respect to\nreproducibility, speed and preservation of topological differences compared to\nvisualization based on multidimensional scaling. The proposal highlights that\nphylogenetic trees are estimated in an extremely high-dimensional space,\nresulting in uncertainty information that cannot be discarded. Most\nimportantly, it is a method that allows biologists to diagnose whether\ndifferences between gene trees are biologically meaningful, or due to\nuncertainty in estimation.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03456v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

Callan Jr.', 'Arnold Levine', 'Thierry Mora', 'Aleksandra M. Walczak'], u'2016-11-09', u'The ability of the adaptive immune system to respond to arbitrary pathogens\nstems from the broad diversity of immune cell surface receptors (TCRs). This\ndiversity originates in a stochastic DNA editing process (VDJ recombination)\nthat acts each time a new immune cell is created from a stem cell. By analyzing\nT cell sequence repertoires taken from the blood and thymus of mice of\ndifferent ages, we quantify the significant changes in this process that occur\nin development from embryo to young adult. We find a rapid increase with age in\nthe number of random insertions in the VDJ recombination process, leading to a\ndramatic increase in diversity. Since the blood accumulates thymic output over\ntime, blood repertoires are mixtures of different statistical recombination\nprocesses and, by unraveling the mixture statistics, we can obtain a clear\npicture of the time evolution of the early immune system. Sequence repertoire\nanalysis also allows us to detect the effect of selection on the output of the\nVDJ recombination process. The effects we find are nearly identical between\nthymus and blood, suggesting that they mainly reflect selection for proper\nfolding of the TCR receptor protein.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03119v1', ['Populations and Evolution', 'Genomics'], []]
[u'Modelling correlated marker effects in genome-wide prediction via\n  Gaussian concentration graph models', ['Carlos Alberto Martinez', 'Kshitij Khare', 'Syed Rahman', 'Mauricio A. Elzo'], u'2016-11-10', u'In genome-wide prediction, independence of marker allele substitution effects\nis typically assumed; however, since early stages of this technology it has\nbeen known that nature points to correlated effects. In statistics, graphical\nmodels have been identified as a useful and powerful tool for covariance\nestimation in high dimensional problems and it is an area that has recently\nexperienced a great expansion. In particular, Gaussian concentration graph\nmodels (GCGM) have been widely studied. These are models in which the\ndistribution of a set of random variables, the marker effects in this case, is\nassumed to be Markov with respect to an undirected graph G. In this paper,\nBayesian (Bayes G and Bayes G-D) and frequentist (GML-BLUP) methods adapting\nthe theory of GCGM to genome-wide prediction were developed. Different\napproaches to define the graph G based on domain-specific knowledge were\nproposed, and two propositions and a corollary establishing conditions to find\ndecomposable graphs were proven. These methods were implemented in small\nsimulated and real datasets. In our simulations, scenarios where correlations\namong allelic substitution effects were expected to arise due to various causes\nwere considered, and graphs were defined on the basis of physical marker\npositions. Results showed improvements in correlation between phenotypes and\npredicted breeding values and accuracies of predicted breeding values when\naccounting for partially correlated allele substitution effects. Extensions to\nthe multiallelic loci case were described and some possible refinements\nincorporating more flexible priors in the Bayesian setting were discussed. Our\nmodels are promising because they allow incorporation of biological information\nin the prediction process, and because they are more flexible and general than\nother models accounting for correlated marker effects that have been proposed\npreviously.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03361v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]

Most of the currently available feature-selection methods\nreturn only a single subset of features, supposedly the one with the highest\npredictive power. We argue that in several domains multiple subsets can achieve\nclose to maximal predictive accuracy, and that arbitrarily providing only one\nhas several drawbacks. The SES method attempts to identify multiple, predictive\nfeature subsets whose performances are statistically equivalent. Under that\nrespect SES subsumes and extends previous feature selection algorithms, like\nthe max-min parent children algorithm. SES is implemented in an homonym\nfunction included in the R package MXM, standing for mens ex machina, meaning\n'mind from the machine' in Latin. The MXM implementation of SES handles several\ndata-analysis tasks, namely classification, regression and survival analysis.\nIn this paper we present the SES algorithm, its implementation, and provide\nexamples of use of the SES function in R. Furthermore, we analyze three\npublicly available data sets to illustrate the equivalence of the signatures\nretrieved by SES and to contrast SES against the state-of-the-art feature\nselection method LASSO. Our results provide initial evidence that the two\nmethods perform comparably well in terms of predictive accuracy and that\nmultiple, equally predictive signatures are actually present in real world\ndata.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03227v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Therapeutic target discovery using Boolean network attractors: updates\n  from kali', ['Arnaud Poret'], u'2016-11-10', u'In a previous article, an algorithm for discovering therapeutic targets in\nBoolean networks modeling disease mechanisms was introduced. In the present\narticle, the updates made on this algorithm, named kali, are described. These\nupdates are: i) the possibility to work on asynchronous Boolean networks, ii) a\nsmarter search for therapeutic targets, and iii) the possibility to use\nmultivalued logic. kali assumes that the attractors of a dynamical system\ncorrespond to the phenotypes of the modeled biological system. Given a logical\nmodel of a pathophysiology, either Boolean or multivalued, kali searches for\nwhich biological components should be therapeutically disturbed in order to\nreduce the reachability of the attractors associated with pathological\nphenotypes, thus reducing the likeliness of pathological phenotypes. kali is\nillustrated on a simple example network and shows that it can find therapeutic\ntargets able to reduce the likeliness of pathological phenotypes. However, like\nany computational tool, kali can predict but can not replace human expertise:\nit is an aid for coping with the complexity of biological systems.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03144v1', ['Quantitative Methods', 'Molecular Networks'], []]
[u'Polygenic score analyses of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder with\n  cardiometabolic traits', ['Hon-Cheong So', 'Pak C. Sham'], u'2016-11-10', u'Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) represent a major health issue in patients with\nschizophrenia and bipolar disorder (BD). While many studies have shown\nincreased CVD risks in schizophrenia and BD, the underlying mechanisms remain\nunclear. Psychiatric medications such as anti-psychotics and various mood\nstabilizers are associated with metabolic syndrome and CVD. Yet metabolic\nabnormalities have been reported in drug-na\\"ive patients, leading to our\nhypothesis that the two types of disorders may share a common genetic basis.\nUsing a polygenic risk score (PRS) approach, we investigated the associations\nof schizophrenia and BD with a comprehensive panel of cardiometabolic traits.\nEffect sizes of individual variants were based on large-scale meta-analyses of\ngenome-wide association studies (GWAS). We performed two kinds of analyses, one\nbased on paired summary statistics results and the other based on the Northern\nFinland Birth Cohort, a GWAS sample with measurement of metabolic traits. We\nfound strong evidence of genetic predisposition to glucose metabolism\nabnormalities, type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease in both\nschizophrenia and BD patients. On the other hand, we observed an inverse\nrelationship between PRS of body mass index (BMI) and both schizophrenia and\nBD. However, schizophrenia was associated with higher polygenic scores of\nwaist-hip ratio, especially after controlling for BMI. Taken together, these\nresults suggested shared genetic bases among cardiometabolic traits with\nschizophrenia and BD. Increased awareness and proper management of\ncardiovascular risk factors are crucial to reduce the associated morbidities\nand mortalities in these patients.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03191v1', ['Genomics'], []]
