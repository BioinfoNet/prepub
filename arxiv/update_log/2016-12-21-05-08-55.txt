[u'An EEG study of creativity in expert classical musicians', ['Tom De Smedt', 'Lieven Menschaert', 'Pieter Heremans', 'Ludivine Lechat', 'Gaelle Dhooghe'], u'2016-12-18', u'Previous research has shown positive correlations between EEG alpha activity and performing creative tasks. In this study, expert classical musicians (n=4) were asked to play their instrument while being monitored with a wireless EEG headset. Data was collected during two rehearsal types: (a) in their regular, fixed ensemble;; (b) in an improvised, mixed ensemble with unfamiliar musicians and less rehearsal time. A positive correlation was found between alpha power and the improvised setup (p<0.01, d=0.4). A positive correlation was also found between alpha power and more intense play (p<0.01, d=0.2). There was a negative correlation between alpha power and arousal due to stress, e.g., frowning after playing a false note (p<0.01, d=0.6). Finally, the real-time capabilities of wireless EEG monitoring were explored with a data visualisation during live performance on stage.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.06719v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'The feasibility of equilibria in large ecosystems: a primary but neglected concept in the complexity-stability debate', ['Michael Dougoud', 'Laura Vinckenbosch', 'Rudolf Rohr', 'Louis-Felix Bersier', 'Christian Mazza'], u'2016-12-20', u'The consensus that complexity begets stability in ecosystems was challenged in the seventies, a result recently extended to ecologically-inspired networks. The approaches assume the existence of a feasible equilibrium, i.e. with positive abundances. However, this key assumption has not been tested. We provide analytical results complemented by simulations which show that equilibrium feasibility vanishes in species rich systems. This result leaves us in the uncomfortable situation in which the existence of a feasible equilibrium assumed in local stability criteria is far from granted. We extend our analyses by changing interaction structure and intensity, and find that feasibility and stability is warranted irrespective of species richness with weak interactions. Interestingly, we find that the dynamical behaviour of ecologically inspired architectures is very different and richer than that of unstructured systems. Our results suggest that a general understanding of ecosystem dynamics requires focusing on the interplay between interaction strength and network architecture.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.06735v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Robust permanence for ecological equations with internal and external feedbacks', ['Swati Patel', 'Sebastian J Schreiber'], u'2016-12-20', u'Species experience both internal feedbacks with endogenous factors such as trait evolution and external feedbacks with exogenous factors such as weather. These feedbacks can play an important role in determining whether populations persist or communities of species coexist. To provide a general mathematical framework for studying these effects, we develop a theorem for coexistence for ecological models accounting for internal and external feedbacks. Specifically, we use average Lyapunov functions and Morse decompositions to develop sufficient and necessary conditions for robust permanence, a form of coexistence robust to large perturbations of the population densities and small structural perturbations of the models. We illustrate how our results can be applied to verify permanence in non-autonomous models, structured population models, including those with frequency-dependent feedbacks, and models of eco-evolutionary dynamics. In these applications, we discuss how our results relate to previous results for models with particular types of feedbacks.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.06554v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Galactic Distribution of Chirality Sources', ['Daniel S. Helman'], u'2016-12-19', u'Biochemical processes are known to utilize only one enantiomer, e.g. amino acids used by terrestrial life are generally the left-handed version. The concepts of chirality, optical activity and chiral enrichment are explored in the context of the origin of life in the universe before Earth. Chirality as a feature of terrestrial life suggests neither a special place for local development of homochirality nor for extra-terrestrial enrichment and delivery. Each seems to have some strengths. Chiral enrichment on asteroids or comets could have been promoted via photon polarization or preferential growth on ice mineral faces or both. Chiral enrichment in situ could have occurred via a variety of processes, including zeolite or sulfide surface templating. Stellar and planetary magnetic fields are discussed as well, and a novel mechanism for geomagnetic reversals is introduced based on analogy with stellar processes. Mineral classes and environments are also explored along with four hypothetical scenarios: asteroid/comet delivery; chemical gardens; geothermal fields; and icy worlds.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.06720v1', ['Other'], []]
[u'Partially blind domain adaptation for age prediction from DNA methylation data', ['Lisa Handl', 'Adrin Jalali', 'Michael Scherer', 'Nico Pfeifer'], u'2016-12-20', u"Over the last years, huge resources of biological and medical data have become available for research. This data offers great chances for machine learning applications in health care, e.g. for precision medicine, but is also challenging to analyze. Typical challenges include a large number of possibly correlated features and heterogeneity in the data. One flourishing field of biological research in which this is relevant is epigenetics. Here, especially large amounts of DNA methylation data have emerged. This epigenetic mark has been used to predict a donor's 'epigenetic age' and increased epigenetic aging has been linked to lifestyle and disease history. In this paper we propose an adaptive model which performs feature selection for each test sample individually based on the distribution of the input data. The method can be seen as partially blind domain adaptation. We apply the model to the problem of age prediction based on DNA methylation data from a variety of tissues, and compare it to a standard model, which does not take heterogeneity into account. The standard approach has particularly bad performance on one tissue type on which we show substantial improvement with our new adaptive approach even though no samples of that tissue were part of the training data.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.06650v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'RIDS: Robust Identification of Sparse Gene Regulatory Networks from Perturbation Experiments', ['Hoi-To Wai', 'Anna Scaglione', 'Uzi Harush', 'Baruch Barzel', 'Amir Leshem'], u'2016-12-20', u"Reconstructing the causal network in a complex dynamical system plays a crucial role in many applications, from sub-cellular biology to economic systems. Here we focus on inferring gene regulation networks (GRNs) from perturbation or gene deletion experiments. Despite their scientific merit, such perturbation experiments are not often used for such inference due to their costly experimental procedure, requiring significant resources to complete the measurement of every single experiment. To overcome this challenge, we develop the Robust IDentification of Sparse networks (RIDS) method that reconstructs the GRN from a small number of perturbation experiments. Our method uses the gene expression data observed in each experiment and translates that into a steady state condition of the system's nonlinear interaction dynamics. Applying a sparse optimization criterion, we are able to extract the parameters of the underlying weighted network, even from very few experiments. In fact, we demonstrate analytically that, under certain conditions, the GRN can be perfectly reconstructed using $K = \\Omega (d_{max})$ perturbation experiments, where $d_{max}$ is the maximum in-degree of the GRN, a small value for realistic sparse networks, indicating that RIDS can achieve high performance with a scalable number of experiments. We test our method on both synthetic and experimental data extracted from the DREAM5 network inference challenge. We show that the RIDS achieves superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods, while requiring as few as ~60% less experimental data. Moreover, as opposed to almost all competing methods, RIDS allows us to infer the directionality of the GRN links, allowing us to infer empirical GRNs, without relying on the commonly provided list of transcription factors.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.06565v1', ['Quantitative Methods', 'Molecular Networks'], []]
[u'The boundary length and point spectrum enumeration of partial chord diagrams using cut and join recursion', ['Jrgen Ellegaard Andersen', 'Hiroyuki Fuji', 'Robert C. Penner', 'Christian M. Reidys'], u'2016-12-20', u'We introduce the boundary length and point spectrum, as a joint generalization of the boundary length spectrum and boundary point spectrum in arXiv:1307.0967. We establish by cut-and-join methods that the number of partial chord diagrams filtered by the boundary length and point spectrum satisfies a recursion relation, which combined with an initial condition determines these numbers uniquely. This recursion relation is equivalent to a second order, non-linear, algebraic partial differential equation for the generating function of the numbers of partial chord diagrams filtered by the boundary length and point spectrum.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.06482v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
