[u'Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in skeletal muscle health and disease', ['Jingsong Zhou', 'Kamal Dhakal', 'Jianxun Yi'], u'2016-07-28', u'Muscle uses Ca2+ as a messenger to control contraction and relies on ATP to\nmaintain the intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis. Mitochondria are the major\nsub-cellular organelle of ATP production. With a negative inner membrane\npotential, mitochondria take up Ca2+ from their surroundings, a process called\nmitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. Under physiological conditions, Ca2+ uptake into\nmitochondria promotes ATP production. Excessive uptake causes mitochondrial\nCa2+ overload, which activates downstream adverse responses leading to cell\ndysfunction. Moreover, mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake could shape spatio-temporal\npatterns of intracellular Ca2+ signaling. Malfunction of mitochondrial Ca2+\nuptake is implicated in muscle degeneration. Unlike non-excitable cells,\nmitochondria in muscle cells experience dramatic changes of intracellular Ca2+\nlevels. Besides the sudden elevation of Ca2+ level induced by action\npotentials, Ca2+ transients in muscle cells can be as short as a few\nmilliseconds during a single twitch or as long as minutes during tetanic\ncontraction, which raises the question whether mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake is\nfast and big enough to shape intracellular Ca2+ signaling during\nexcitation-contraction coupling and creates technical challenges for\nquantification of the dynamic changes of Ca2+ inside mitochondria. This review\nfocuses on characterization of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in skeletal muscle and\nits role in muscle physiology and diseases.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.08507v1', ['Biomolecules', 'Subcellular Processes'], []]
[u'Correlated activity of periodically driven binary networks', ['Tobias Kuhn', 'Moritz Helias'], u'2016-07-28', u'Experiments showed that excess synchronous spike events are locked to the\nphase of beta-oscillations in the local field potential (LFP) more strongly\nthan spikes that appear in isolation [Denker et al. 2011, Cereb. Cortex]. To\nidentify the mechanisms by which correlations depend on the phase of the LFP,\nwhich primarily reflects input activity, we examine a balanced network of\nhomogeneously connected binary model neurons receiving input from a sinusoidal\nperturbation. Its temporal evolution is described by Glauber dynamics, which is\nsimulated and investigated analytically. Applying mean-field theory and\ntreating the periodic input in linear response theory, the cyclostationary mean\nactivities and pairwise zero-time-lag correlations are analytically computed.\nThey agree with their simulated counterparts over a wide parameter range. We\nfind that correlations are time dependent by two distinct mechanisms, one due\nto the modulated susceptibility (via the external input and network feedback)\nand one due to the time-varying autocorrelations. For some parameters, this\nleads to resonant correlations even if mean activities show non-resonant\nbehavior. Our results can help to answer the salient question how oscillations\nin mesoscopic signals and spike correlations interact.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.08552v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'The iterative reweighted Mixed-Norm Estimate for spatio-temporal MEG/EEG\n  source reconstruction', ['Daniel Strohmeier', 'Yousra Bekhti', 'Jens Haueisen', 'Alexandre Gramfort'], u'2016-07-28', u'Source imaging based on magnetoencephalography (MEG) and\nelectroencephalography (EEG) allows for the non-invasive analysis of brain\nactivity with high temporal and good spatial resolution. As the\nbioelectromagnetic inverse problem is ill-posed, constraints are required. For\nthe analysis of evoked brain activity, spatial sparsity of the neuronal\nactivation is a common assumption. It is often taken into account using convex\nconstraints based on the l1-norm. The resulting source estimates are however\nbiased in amplitude and often suboptimal in terms of source selection due to\nhigh correlations in the forward model. In this work, we demonstrate that an\ninverse solver based on a block-separable penalty with a Frobenius norm per\nblock and a l0.5-quasinorm over blocks addresses both of these issues. For\nsolving the resulting non-convex optimization problem, we propose the iterative\nreweighted Mixed Norm Estimate (irMxNE), an optimization scheme based on\niterative reweighted convex surrogate optimization problems, which are solved\nefficiently using a block coordinate descent scheme and an active set strategy.\nWe compare the proposed sparse imaging method to the dSPM and the RAP-MUSIC\napproach based on two MEG data sets. We provide empirical evidence based on\nsimulations and analysis of MEG data that the proposed method improves on the\nstandard Mixed Norm Estimate (MxNE) in terms of amplitude bias, support\nrecovery, and stability.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.08458v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Evidence accumulation and change rate inference in dynamic environments', ['Adrian E Radillo', 'Alan Veliz-Cuba', 'Kresimir Josic', 'Zachary P Kilpatrick'], u'2016-07-28', u'In a constantly changing world, animals must account for environmental\nvolatility when making decisions. To appropriately discount older, irrelevant\ninformation, they need to learn the rate at which the environment changes. We\ndevelop an ideal observer model capable of inferring the present state of the\nenvironment along with its rate of change. Key to this computation is updating\nthe posterior probability of all possible changepoint counts. This computation\ncan be challenging, as the number of possibilities grows rapidly with time.\nHowever, we show how the computations can be simplified in the continuum limit\nby a moment closure approximation. The resulting low-dimensional system can be\nused to infer the environmental state and change rate with accuracy comparable\nto the ideal observer. The approximate computations can be performed by a\nneural network model via a rate-correlation based plasticity rule. We thus show\nhow optimal observers accumulates evidence in changing environments, and map\nthis computation to reduced models which perform inference using plausible\nneural mechanisms.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.08318v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Competition of tolerant strategies in the spatial public goods game', ['Attila Szolnoki', 'Matjaz Perc'], u'2016-07-28', u'Tolerance implies enduring trying circumstances with a fair and objective\nattitude. To determine whether evolutionary advantages might be stemming from\ndiverse levels of tolerance in a population, we study a spatial public goods\ngame, where in addition to cooperators, defectors, and loners, tolerant players\nare also present. Depending on the number of defectors within a group, a\ntolerant player can either cooperate in or abstain from a particular instance\nof the game. We show that the diversity of tolerance can give rise to\nsynergistic effects, wherein players with a different threshold in terms of the\ntolerated number of defectors in a group compete most effectively against\ndefection and default abstinence. Such synergistic associations can stabilise\nstates of full cooperation where otherwise defection would dominate. We observe\ncomplex pattern formation that gives rise to an intricate phase diagram, where\ninvisible yet stable strategy alliances require outmost care lest they are\noverlooked. Our results highlight the delicate importance of diversity and\ntolerance for the provisioning of public goods, and they reveal fascinating\nsubtleties of the spatiotemporal dynamics that is due to the competition of\nsubsystem solutions in structured populations.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.08600v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Confidence sets for phylogenetic trees', ['Amy Willis'], u'2016-07-28', u'Inferring evolutionary histories (phylogenetic trees) has important\napplications in biology, criminology and public health. However, phylogenetic\ntrees are complex mathematical objects that reside in a non-Euclidean space,\nwhich complicates their analysis. While our mathematical, algorithmic, and\nprobabilistic understanding of the behavior of phylogenies in their metric\nspace is relatively mature, rigorous inferential infrastructure is as yet\nundeveloped. In this manuscript we unify recent computational and probabilistic\nadvancements to propose a method for constructing tree-valued confidence sets.\nThe procedure accounts for both centre and multiple directions of tree-valued\nvariability, proposing advantages over existing methods that are exploratory\nand only address a single direction of variability. We demonstrate fast\nidentification of splits with weak and strong support, eliminating problems of\nsimultaneous inference that arise when only bootstrap cladal support is\nconsidered. We draw on statistical concepts of block replicates for improved\ntesting, investigating the hypothesis of isotrophy in a turtle evolution\ndataset, identifying the best supported most recent ancestor of the Zika virus\n(Pacific strains, contrary to media releases in Latin America), and formally\ntest the hypothesis that a Floridian dentist with AIDS infected two of his\npatients with HIV. The method illustrates connections between variability in\nEuclidean and tree space, opening phylogenetic tree analysis to techniques\navailable in the multivariate Euclidean setting.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.08288v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
