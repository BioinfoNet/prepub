[u'Deep learning is competing random forest in computational docking', ['Mohamed Khamis', 'Walid Gomaa', 'Basem Galal'], u'2016-08-23', u"Computational docking is the core process of computer-aided drug design; it\naims at predicting the best orientation and conformation of a small drug\nmolecule when bound to a target large protein receptor. The docking quality is\ntypically measured by a scoring function: a mathematical predictive model that\nproduces a score representing the binding free energy and hence the stability\nof the resulting complex molecule. We analyze the performance of both learning\ntechniques on the scoring power, the ranking power, docking power, and\nscreening power using the PDBbind 2013 database. For the scoring and ranking\npowers, the proposed learning scoring functions depend on a wide range of\nfeatures (energy terms, pharmacophore, intermolecular) that entirely\ncharacterize the protein-ligand complexes. For the docking and screening\npowers, the proposed learning scoring functions depend on the intermolecular\nfeatures of the RF-Score to utilize a larger number of training complexes. For\nthe scoring power, the DL\\_RF scoring function achieves Pearson's correlation\ncoefficient between the predicted and experimentally measured binding\naffinities of 0.799 versus 0.758 of the RF scoring function. For the ranking\npower, the DL scoring function ranks the ligands bound to fixed target protein\nwith accuracy 54% for the high-level ranking and with accuracy 78% for the\nlow-level ranking while the RF scoring function achieves (46% and 62%)\nrespectively. For the docking power, the DL\\_RF scoring function has a success\nrate when the three best-scored ligand binding poses are considered within 2\n\\AA\\ root-mean-square-deviation from the native pose of 36.0% versus 30.2% of\nthe RF scoring function. For the screening power, the DL scoring function has\nan average enrichment factor and success rate at the top 1% level of (2.69 and\n6.45%) respectively versus (1.61 and 4.84%) respectively of the RF scoring\nfunction.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06665v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Emergence of low noise \\emph{frustrated} states in E/I balanced neural\n  networks', ['Ibon Recio', 'Joaquin J. Torres'], u'2016-08-23', u'We study emerging phenomena in binary neural networks where, with a\nprobability c synaptic intensities are chosen according with a Hebbian\nprescription, and with probability (1-c) there is an extra random contribution\nto synaptic weights. This new term, randomly taken from a Gaussian bimodal\ndistribution, balances the synaptic population in the network so that one has\n80-20 relation in E/I population ratio, mimicking the balance observed in\nmammals cortex. For some regions of the relevant parameters, our system depicts\nstandard memory (at low temperature) and non-memory attractors (at high\ntemperature). However, as c decreases and the level of the underlying noise\nalso decreases below a certain temperature T_t, a kind of memory-frustrated\nstate, which resembles spin-glass behavior, sharply emerges. Contrary to what\noccurs in Hopfield-like neural networks, the frustrated state appears here even\nin the limit of the loading parameter alpha-->0. Moreover, we observed that the\nfrustrated state in fact corresponds to two states of non-vanishing activity\nuncorrelated with stored memories, associated, respectively, to a high activity\nor Up state and to a low activity or Down state. Using a linear stability\nanalysis, we found regions in the space of relevant parameters for locally\nstable steady states and demonstrated that frustrated states coexist with\nmemory attractors below T_t. Then, multistability between memory and frustrated\nstates is present for relatively small c, and metastability of memory\nattractors can emerge as c decreases even more. We studied our system using\nstandard mean-field techniques and with Monte Carlo simulations, obtaining a\nperfect agreement between theory and simulations. Our study can be useful to\n...', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06671v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Direct likelihood-based inference for discretely observed stochastic\n  compartmental models of infectious disease', ['Lam Si Tung Ho', 'Forrest W. Crawford', 'Marc A. Suchard'], u'2016-08-24', u'Stochastic compartmental models are important tools for understanding the\ncourse of infectious diseases epidemics in populations and in prospective\nevaluation of intervention policies. However, calculating the likelihood for\ndiscretely observed data from even simple models - such as the ubiquitous\nsusceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) model - has been considered\ncomputationally intractable, since its formulation almost a century ago.\nRecently researchers have proposed methods to circumvent this limitation\nthrough data augmentation or approximation, but these approaches often suffer\nfrom high computational cost or loss of accuracy. We develop the mathematical\nfoundation and an efficient algorithm to compute the likelihood for discretely\nobserved data from a broad class of stochastic compartmental models. The\ncomputational complexity scales polynomially with the changes in population\nsizes between observations. We achieve this through a novel reparameterization\nof the stochastic compartmental model into a multivariate coupled birth process\nand identify a convenient recursion to express the Laplace transform of the\nfinite-time transition probabilities. We also give expressions for the\nderivatives of the transition probabilities using the same technique, making\npossible inference via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC). We use the 17th century\nplague in Eyam, a classic example of the SIR model, to compare our recursion\nmethod to sequential Monte Carlo, analyze using HMC, and assess the model\nassumptions. We also apply our direct likelihood evaluation to perform Bayesian\ninference for the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak in Guinea under a hierarchical and\ntime-inhomogeneous extension of the SIR model. The results suggest that the\nepidemic infectious rates have decreased since October 2014 in the Southeast\nregion of Guinea, while rates remain the same in other regions.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06769v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

[u'Full Computational Reproducibility in Biological Science: Methods,\n  Software and a Case Study in Protein Biology', ['Les Hatton', 'Gregory Warr'], u'2016-08-24', u'Independent computational reproducibility of scientific results is rapidly\nbecoming of pivotal importance in scientific progress as computation itself\nplays a more and more central role in so many branches of science.\nHistorically, reproducibility has followed the familiar Popperian [38] model\nwhereby theory cannot be verified by scientific testing, it can only be\nfalsified. Ultimately, this implies that if an experiment cannot be reproduced\nindependently to some satisfactory level of precision, its value is essentially\nunquantifiable; put brutally, it is impossible to determine its scientific\nvalue. The burgeoning presence of software in most scientific work adds a new\nand particularly opaque layer of complexity [29]. In spite of much recent\ninterest in many scientific areas, emphasis remains more on procedures,\nstrictures and discussion [12, 14, 16, 29, 30, 37, 41], reflecting the\ninexperience of most scientific journals when it comes to software, rather than\nthe details of how computational reproducibility is actually achieved, for\nwhich there appear to be relatively few guiding examples [6, 10, 17]. After\nconsidering basic principles, here we show how full computational\nreproducibility can be achieved in practice at every stage using a case study\nof a multi-gigabyte protein study on the open SwissProt protein database, from\ndata download all the way to individual figure by figure reproduction as an\nexemplar for general scientific computation.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06897v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]

To understand the\ncollective cell dynamics in three dimensional extracellular matrix (ECM), we\nhave developed a simple and mechanical-based strategy, Diskoid In Geometrically\nMicropatterned ECM (DIGME). DIGME allows easy engineering of the shape of 3-D\ntissue organoid, the mesoscale ECM heterogeneity, and the fiber alignment of\ncollagen-based ECM all at the same time.

[u'Growth and Scaling during Development and Regeneration', ['Steffen Werner'], u'2016-08-19', u'Life presents fascinating examples of self-organization and emergent\nphenomena. In multi-cellular organisms, a multitude of cells interact to form\nand maintain highly complex body plans of well-defined size. In this thesis, we\ninvestigate theoretical feedback mechanisms for both self-organized body plan\npatterning and size control.\n  The thesis is inspired by the astonishing scaling and regeneration abilities\nof flatworms. These worms can perfectly regrow their entire body plan even from\ntiny amputation fragments like the tip of the tail. Moreover, they can grow and\nactively de-grow by more than a factor of 40 in length depending on feeding\nconditions. These capabilities prompt for remarkable physical mechanisms of\nself-organized pattern formation and scaling.\n  First, we explore the basic principles and challenges of pattern scaling in\nmechanisms previously proposed to describe biological pattern formation. Next,\nwe present a novel class of patterning mechanisms yielding entirely\nself-organized and self-scaling patterns. This framework captures essential\nfeatures of body plan regeneration and scaling in flatworms. Further, we\nanalyze shape and motility of flatworms. By applying principal component\nanalysis, we characterize shape dynamics during different motility modes and\nalso identify shape variations between different flatworm species. Finally, we\ninvestigate the metabolic control of cell turnover and growth. We identify\nthree mechanisms of metabolic energy storage; theoretical descriptions thereof\ncan explain the measured organism growth by rules on the cellular scale.\n  In a close collaboration with experimental biologists, we combine minimal\ntheoretical descriptions with state-of-the-art experiments and data analysis.\nThis allows us to identify generic principles of scalable body plan patterning\nand growth control in flatworms.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06918v1', ['Tissues and Organs'], []]
