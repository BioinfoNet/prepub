[u'Theory on the mechanisms of combinatorial binding of transcription\n  factors with DNA', ['R. Murugan'], u'2016-10-20', u'We develop a theoretical framework on the mechanism of combinatorial binding\nof transcription factors (TFs) with their specific binding sites on DNA. We\nconsider three possible mechanisms viz. monomer, hetero-oligomer and\ncoordinated recruitment pathways. In the monomer pathway, combinatorial TFs\nsearch for their targets in an independent manner and the protein-protein\ninteractions among them will be insignificant. The protein-protein interactions\nare very strong so that the hetero-oligomer complex of TFs as a whole searches\nfor the cognate sites in case of hetero-oligomer pathway. The TF which arrived\nfirst will recruit the adjacent TFs in a sequential manner in the recruitment\npathway. The free energy released from the protein-protein interactions among\nTFs will be in turn utilized to stabilize the TFs-DNA complex. Such coordinated\nbinding of TFs in fact emerges as the cooperative effect. Monomer and\nhetero-oligomer pathways are efficient only when few TFs are involved in the\ncombinatorial regulation. Detailed random walk simulations suggest that when\nthe number of TFs in a combination increases then the searching efficiency of\nTFs in these pathways decreases with the increasing number of TFs in a power\nlaw manner. The power law exponent associated with the monomer pathway seems to\nbe strongly dependent on the number of TFs, distance between the initial\nposition of TFs from their specific binding sites and the hop size associated\nwith the dynamics of TFs on DNA.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06311v1', ['Biomolecules', 'Subcellular Processes'], []]
[u'The Cluster-Span Threshold: network binarisation for information-rich\n  medium density ranges', ['Keith Smith', 'Daniel Abasalo', 'Javier Escudero'], u'2016-10-20', u"Objective: Research into network modelling of brain function faces a\nmethodological challenge in selecting an appropriate threshold to binarise edge\nweights. We present a novel, non-arbitrary threshold for functional\nconnectivity brain networks named the Cluster-Span Threshold (CST) which\nensures a trade-off of sparsity and information richness in the network.\n  Methods: We compare CST networks with weighted networks, minimum spanning\ntrees, union of shortest path graphs and proportional arbitrary thresholds. We\ntest these techniques on weighted complex hierarchy models by contrasting\nmodels with small parametric differences via $t$-tests of network metrics.\nUsing this comparison approach we also test the robustness of the techniques to\nalterations in the network in the form of random and targeted attacks. We\nextend these results with the analysis of three relevant EEG datasets: eyes\nopen and closed resting states; visual short-term memory tasks; and resting\nstate Alzheimer's disease with a healthy control group.\n  Results: We find that the CST consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art\nbinarisation methods for topological accuracy and robustness. These results are\nconfirmed in the real data, where the CST proves the most sensitive of\nnon-arbitrary techniques.\n  Conclusion: The CST is a sensitive, multi-purpose threshold to aid network\nmodelling of functional connectivity.\n  Significance: We provide a non-arbitrary and robust solution to the problem\nof binarising functional networks- a key processing step for functional network\nanalysis. We also provide insights into the effects of network size and density\non the topological accuracy of a binarised functional connectivity network.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06360v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Mixed Neural Network Approach for Temporal Sleep Stage Classification', ['Hao Dong', 'Akara Supratak', 'Wei Pan', 'Chao Wu', 'Paul M. Matthews', 'Yike Guo'], u'2016-10-15', u'This paper proposes a practical approach to addressing limitations posed by\nuse of single active electrodes in applications for sleep stage classification.\nElectroencephalography (EEG)-based characterizations of sleep stage progression\ncontribute the diagnosis and monitoring of the many pathologies of sleep.\nSeveral prior reports have explored ways of automating the analysis of sleep\nEEG and of reducing the complexity of the data needed for reliable\ndiscrimination of sleep stages in order to make it possible to perform sleep\nstudies at lower cost in the home (rather than only in specialized clinical\nfacilities). However, these reports have involved recordings from electrodes\nplaced on the cranial vertex or occiput, which can be uncomfortable or\ndifficult for subjects to position. Those that have utilized single EEG\nchannels which contain less sleep information, have showed poor classification\nperformance. We have taken advantage of Rectifier Neural Network for feature\ndetection and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for sequential data\nlearning to optimize classification performance with single electrode\nrecordings. After exploring alternative electrode placements, we found a\ncomfortable configuration of a single-channel EEG on the forehead and have\nshown that it can be integrated with additional electrodes for simultaneous\nrecording of the electroocuolgram (EOG). Evaluation of data from 62 people\n(with 494 hours sleep) demonstrated better performance of our analytical\nalgorithm for automated sleep classification than existing approaches using\nvertex or occipital electrode placements. Use of this recording configuration\nwith neural network deconvolution promises to make clinically indicated home\nsleep studies practical.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06421v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'A Heterogeneous Out-of-Equilibrium Nonlinear $q$-Voter Model with\n  Zealotry', ['Andrew Mellor', 'Mauro Mobilia', 'R. K. P. Zia'], u'2016-10-19', u'We study the dynamics of the out-of-equilibrium nonlinear q-voter model with\ntwo types of susceptible voters and zealots, introduced in [EPL 113, 48001\n(2016)]. In this model, each individual supports one of two parties and is\neither a susceptible voter of type $q_1$ or $q_2$, or is an inflexible zealot.\nAt each time step, a $q_i$-susceptible voter ($i = 1,2$) consults a group of\n$q_i$ neighbors and adopts their opinion if all group members agree, while\nzealots are inflexible and never change their opinion. This model violates\ndetailed balance whenever $q_1 \\neq q_2$ and is characterized by two distinct\nregimes of low and high density of zealotry. Here, by combining analytical and\nnumerical methods, we investigate the non-equilibrium stationary state of the\nsystem in terms of its probability distribution, non-vanishing currents and\nunequal-time two-point correlation functions. We also study the switching times\nproperties of the model by exploiting approximate mappings onto the model of\n[Phys. Rev. E 92, 012803 (2015)] that satisfies the detailed balance, and also\noutline some properties of the model near criticality.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06092v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Updating the Inverse of a Matrix When Removing the $i$th Row and Column\n  with an Application to Disease Modeling', ['Cody Palmer'], u'2016-10-18', u'The Sherman-Woodbury-Morrison (SWM) formula gives an explicit formula for the\ninverse perturbation of a matrix in terms of the inverse of the original matrix\nand the perturbation. This formula is useful for numerical applications. We\nhave produced similar results, giving an expression for the inverse of a matrix\nwhen the $i$th row and column are removed. However, our expression involves\ntaking a limit, which inhibits use in similar applications as the SWM formula.\nHowever, using our expression to find an analytical result on the spectral\nradius of a special product of two matrices leads to an application. In\nparticular, we find a way to compute the fundamental reproductive ratio of a\nrelapsing disease being spread by a vector among two species of host that\nundergo a different number of relapses.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06398v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Gd$^{3+}$ - Gd$^{3+}$ distances exceeding 3 nm determined by very high\n  frequency continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance', ['Jessica A. Clayton', 'Mian Qi', 'Adelheid Godt', 'Daniella Goldfarb', 'Songi Han', 'Mark S. Sherwin'], u'2016-10-20', u'Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy in combination with\nsite-directed spin-labeling is a very powerful tool for elucidating the\nstructure and organization of biomolecules. Gd$^{3+}$ complexes have recently\nemerged as a new class of spin labels for distance determination by pulsed EPR\nspectroscopy at Q- and W-band. We present CW EPR measurements at 240 GHz (8.6\nTesla) on a series of Gd-rulers of the type Gd-PyMTA---spacer---Gd-PyMTA, with\nGd-Gd distances ranging from 1.2 nm to 4.3 nm. CW EPR measurements of these\nGd-rulers show that significant dipolar broadening of the central\n$|-1/2\\rangle\\rightarrow|1/2\\rangle$ transition occurs at 30 K for Gd-Gd\ndistances up to $\\sim$ 3.4 nm with Gd-PyMTA as the spin label. This represents\na significant extension for distances accessible by CW EPR, as nitroxide-based\nspin labels at X-band frequencies can typically only access distances up to\n$\\sim$ 2 nm. We show that this broadening persists at biologically relevant\ntemperatures above 200 K, and that this method is further extendable up to room\ntemperature by immobilizing the sample in glassy trehalose. We show that the\npeak-to-peak broadening of the central transition follows the expected $~1/r^3$\ndependence for the electron-electron dipolar interaction, from cryogenic\ntemperatures up to room temperature. A simple procedure for simulating the\ndependence of the lineshape on interspin distance is presented, in which the\nbroadening of the central transition is modeled as an $S=1/2$ spin whose CW EPR\nlineshape is broadened through electron-electron dipolar interactions with a\nneighboring $S=7/2$ spin.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06252v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'The ambiguity of context-specific metabolic model predictions', ['Semidan Robaina-Estevez', 'Zoran Nikoloski'], u'2016-10-19', u'Recent methodological developments have facilitated the integration of\nhigh-throughput data to obtain context-specific metabolic reconstructions. A\nunique solution to this data integration problem often may not be guaranteed,\nleading to a multitude of context-specific predictions equally concordant with\nthe integrated data. Yet, little attention has been paid to the alternative\noptima resulting from the integration of context-specific data. Here we present\ncomputational approaches to analyze alternative optima for different\ncontext-specific data integration instances. By using these approaches on\nmetabolic reconstructions for the leaf of Arabidopsis thaliana and the human\nliver, we show that the analysis of alternative optima is key to adequately\nevaluating the specificity of the predictions in particular cellular contexts.\nWhile we provide several ways to reduce the ambiguity in the context-specific\npredictions, our findings indicate that the existence of alternative optimal\nsolutions warrant caution in detailed context-specific analyses of metabolism.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06240v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
