[u'Generalized flexibility-rigidity index', ['Duc Duy Nguyen', 'Kelin Xia', 'Guo-Wei Wei'], u'2016-09-14', u'Flexibility-rigidity index (FRI) has been developed as a robust, accurate and\nefficient method for macromolecular thermal fluctuation analysis and B-factor\nprediction. The performance of FRI depends on its formulations of rigidity\nindex and flexibility index. In this work, we introduce alternative rigidity\nand flexibility formulations. The structure of the classic Gaussian surface is\nutilized to construct a new type of rigidity index, which leads to a new class\nof rigidity densities with the classic Gaussian surface as a special case.\nAdditionally, we introduce a new type of flexibility index based on the domain\nindicator property of normalized rigidity density. These generalized FRI (gFRI)\nmethods have been extensively validated by the B-factor predictions of 364\nproteins. Significantly outperforming the classic Gaussian network model (GNM),\ngFRI is a new generation of methodologies for accurate, robust and efficient\nanalysis of protein flexibility and fluctuation. Finally, gFRI based molecular\nsurface generation and flexibility visualization are demonstrated.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04306v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Community detection in weighted brain connectivity networks beyond the\n  resolution limit', ['Carlo Nicolini', 'Cecile Bordier', 'Angelo Bifone'], u'2016-09-14', u'Graph theory provides a powerful framework to investigate brain functional\nconnectivity networks and their modular organization. However, most graph-based\nmethods suffer from a fundamental resolution limit that may have affected\nprevious studies and prevented detection of modules, or communities, that are\nsmaller than a specific scale. Surprise, a resolution-limit-free function\nrooted in discrete probability theory, has been recently introduced and applied\nto brain networks, revealing a wide size-distribution of functional modules, in\ncontrast with many previous reports. However, the use of Surprise is limited to\nbinary networks, while brain networks are intrinsically weighted, reflecting a\ncontinuous distribution of connectivity strengths between different brain\nregions. Here, we propose Asymptotical Surprise, a continuous version of\nSurprise, for the study of weighted brain connectivity networks, and validate\nthis approach in synthetic networks endowed with a ground-truth modular\nstructure. We compare Asymptotical Surprise with leading community detection\nmethods currently in use and show its superior sensitivity in the detection of\nsmall modules even in the presence of noise and intersubject variability such\nas those observed in fMRI data. Finally, we apply our novel approach to\nfunctional connectivity networks from resting state fMRI experimenta, and\ndemonstrate a heterogeneous modular organization, with a wide distribution of\nclusters spanning multiple scales.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04316v1', ['Neurons and Cognition', 'Quantitative Methods'], []]

Here we show in a brief mathematical analysis that in\na network in which connection probabilities are symmetric in pairs, $P_{ij} =\nP_{ji}$, the occurrence of bidirectional connections and non-random structures\nare inherently linked; an overabundance of reciprocally connected pairs emerges\nnecessarily when the network structure deviates from a random network in any\nform.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04245v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'On Human Consciousness', ['Peter Grindrod'], u'2016-09-11', u'We consider the implications of the mathematical analysis of\nneurone-to-neurone dynamical complex networks. We show how the dynamical\nbehaviour of small scale strongly connected networks lead naturally to\nnon-binary information processing and thus multiple hypothesis decision making,\neven at the very lowest level of the brain\'s architecture. In turn we build on\nthese ideas to address the hard problem of consciousness. We discuss how a\nproposed "dual hierarchy model", made up form of both external perceived,\nphysical, elements of increasing complexity, and internal mental elements\n(experiences), may support a leaning and evolving consciousness. We discuss the\nidea that a human brain ought to be able to re-conjure subjective mental\nfeelings at will and thus these cannot depend on internal nose (chatter) or\ninternal instability-driven activity. An immediate consequence of this model,\ngrounded in dynamical systems and non-binary information processing, is that\nfinite human brains must always be learning or forgetteing and that any\npossible subjective internal feeling that may be idealised with a countable\ninfinity of facets, can never be learned by zombies or automata: though it can\nbe experienced more and more fully by an evolving brain (yet never in totality,\nnot even in a lifetime).', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04033v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'The Origin of Motif Families in Food Webs', ['Janis Klaise', 'Samuel Johnson'], u'2016-09-14', u'Food webs have been found to exhibit remarkable motif profiles, patterns in\nthe relative prevalences of all possible three-species sub-graphs, and this has\nbeen related to ecosystem properties such as stability and robustness.\nAnalysing 46 food webs of various kinds, we find that most food webs fall into\none of two distinct motif families. The separation between the families is well\npredicted by a global measure of hierarchical order in directed networks -\ntrophic coherence. We find that trophic coherence is also a good predictor for\nthe extent of omnivory, defined as the tendency of species to feed on multiple\ntrophic levels. We compare our results to a network assembly model that admits\ntunable trophic coherence via a single free parameter. The model is able to\ngenerate food webs in either of the two families by varying this parameter, and\ncorrectly classifies almost all the food webs in our database. This establishes\na link between global order and local preying patterns in food webs.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04318v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'An epidemiological model of viral infections in a Varroa-infested bee\n  colony: the case of a bee-dependent mite population size', ['Sara Bernardi', 'Ezio Venturino'], u'2016-09-14', u'In recent years the spread of the ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor has\nbecome the most serious threat to worldwide apiculture. In the model presented\nhere we extend the bee population dynamics with mite viral epidemiology\nexamined in an earlier paper by allowing a bee-dependent mite population size.\nThe results of the analysis match field observations well and give a clear\nexplanation of how Varroa affects the epidemiology of certain naturally\noccurring bee viruses, causing considerable damages to colonies. The model\nallows only four possible stable equilibria, using known field parameters. The\nfirst one contains only the thriving healthy bees. Here the disease is\neradicated and also the mites are wiped out. Alternatively, we find the\nequilibrium still with no mite population, but with endemic disease among the\nthriving bee population. Thirdly, infected bees coexist with the mites in the\nVarroa invasion scenario; in this situation the disease invades the hive,\ndriving the healthy bees to extinction and therefore affecting all the bees.\nCoexistence is also possible, with both populations of bees and mites thriving\nand with the disease endemically affecting both species. The analysis is in\nline with field observations in natural honey bee colonies. Namely, these\ndiseases are endemic and if the mite population is present, necessarily the\nviral infection occurs. Further, in agreement with the fact that the presence\nof Varroa increments the viral transmission, the whole bee population may\nbecome infected when the disease vector is present in the beehive. Also, a low\nhorizontal transmission rate of the virus among the honey bees will help in\nprotecting the bee colonies from Varroa infestation and viral epidemics.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04314v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

[u'Stochastic predator-prey dynamics of transposons in the human genome', ['Chi Xue', 'Nigel Goldenfeld'], u'2016-09-14', u'Transposable elements (TE) are DNA sequences that can jump from site to site\nin the genome during the life cycle of a cell, usually encoding the very\nenzymes which perform their excision. However, some TEs are parasitic, relying\non the enzymes produced by the regular TEs. In this case, we show that a\nstochastic model, which takes into account the small copy numbers of the TEs in\na cell, predicts noise-induced predator-prey oscillations with a characteristic\ntime scale that is much longer than the cell replication time, indicating that\nthe state of the predator-prey oscillator is stored in the genome and\ntransmitted to successive generations. Our work demonstrates the important role\nof number fluctuations in the expression of mobile genetic elements, and shows\nexplicitly how ecological concepts can be applied to the dynamics and\nfluctuations of living genomes.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04136v1', ['Populations and Evolution', 'Genomics'], []]

The level of exogenous reinfection and\nfirst time infection rates within high-incidence settings may influence the\nimpact of control programs on TB prevalence. This study aims at enhancing the\nunderstanding of TB dynamics via the study of scenarios, within {\\it\nsimplified}, two patch, risk-defined environments, in the presence of short\nterm mobility and variations in reinfection and infection rates. The modeling\nframework captures the role of individuals' `daily' dynamics within and between\nplaces of residency, work or business via the proportion of time spent in\nresidence and as visitors to TB-risk environments (patches). As a result, the\n{\\it effective population size} of Patch $i$ (home of $i$-residents) at time\n$t$ must account for visitors and residents of Patch $i$, at time $t$. The\nimpact that {\\it effective population size} and the distribution of {\\it\nindividuals' residence times} in different patches have on TB transmission and\ncontrol are studied using selected scenarios where risk is defined by the\nestimated or perceive first time infection and/or exogenous re-infection rates.\nOur results suggest that, under certain conditions, allowing infected\nindividuals to move from high to low TB prevalence areas (for example via the\nsharing of treatment and isolation facilities) may lead to a reduction in the\ntotal TB prevalence in the overall, here two-patch, population.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04131v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

[u'Scale dependence of mechanics and dynamics of active gels with\n  increasing motor concentration', ['Adar Sonn-Segev', 'Anne Bernheim-Groswasser', 'Yael Roichman'], u'2016-09-14', u'The cytoskeleton protein actin assembles into large bundles when supporting\nstresses in the cell, but grows into a fine branched network to induce cell\nmotion. Such self-organization processes are studied in artificial networks of\ncytoskeleton proteins with thick actin bundles and large motor protein\naggregates to enable optical observation. The effect of motor aggregate size on\nthe cytoskeleton mechanical properties is studied here in networks comprised of\nmuch smaller motor assemblies. Large motor protein clusters are known to\nincrease the stiffness of actin based networks by introducing tension and\nadditional cross-linking cites. We find that these effects are universal to\nactin gels regardless of actin bundle thickness and motor aggregate size and\nare relevant, therefore, to a wide range of cytoskeleton based cellular\nprocesses. In contrast, motor induced active fluctuations depend significantly\non motor assembly size, featuring unique non-Gaussian statistics at high\nconcentrations of small assemblies.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04163v1', ['Subcellular Processes'], []]

We validate the approach with\nexperiments performed in aqueous solutions containing Ca$^{2+}$ and Fluo4\ndextran (both in its High and Low Affinity versions). Performing FCS\nexperiments with tetramethylrhodamine-dextran in Xenopus laevis oocytes, we\ninfer the corresponding free diffusion coefficients in the cytosol of these\ncells.
