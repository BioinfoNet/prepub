[u'Virtual reality analysis of intrinsic protein geometry with applications to cis peptide planes', ['Yanzhen Hou', 'Jin Dai', 'Nevena Ilieva', 'Antti J. Niemi', 'Jianfeng He'], u'2017-06-05', u'A protein is traditionally visualised as a piecewise linear discrete curve, and its geometry is conventionally characterised by the extrinsically determined Ramachandran angles. However, a protein backbone has also two independent intrinsic geometric structures, due to the peptide planes and the side chains. Here we adapt and develop modern 3D virtual reality techniques to scrutinize the atomic geometry along a protein backbone, in the vicinity of a peptide plane. For this we compare backbone geometry-based (extrinsic) and structure-based (intrinsic) coordinate systems, and as an example we inspect the {\\it trans} and {\\it cis} peptide planes. We reveal systematics in the way how a {\\it cis} peptide plane deforms the neighbouring atomic geometry, and we develop a virtual reality based visual methodology that can identify the presence of a {\\it cis} peptide plane from the arrangement of atoms in its vicinity. Our approach can easily detect exceptionally placed atoms in crystallographic structures. Thus it can be employed as a powerful visual refinement tool which is applicable also in the case when resolution of the protein structure is limited and whenever refinement is needed. As concrete examples we identify a number of crystallographic protein structures in Protein Data Bank (PDB) that display exceptional atomic positions around their {\\it cis} peptide planes.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01345v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'DeepSF: deep convolutional neural network for mapping protein sequences to folds', ['Jie Hou', 'Badri Adhikari', 'Jianlin Cheng'], u'2017-06-04', u'Motivation Protein fold recognition is an important problem in structural bioinformatics. Almost all traditional fold recognition methods use sequence (homology) comparison to indirectly predict the fold of a tar get protein based on the fold of a template protein with known structure, which cannot explain the relationship between sequence and fold. Only a few methods had been developed to classify protein sequences into a small number of folds due to methodological limitations, which are not generally useful in practice. Results We develop a deep 1D-convolution neural network (DeepSF) to directly classify any protein se quence into one of 1195 known folds, which is useful for both fold recognition and the study of se quence-structure relationship. Different from traditional sequence alignment (comparison) based methods, our method automatically extracts fold-related features from a protein sequence of any length and map it to the fold space. We train and test our method on the datasets curated from SCOP1.75, yielding a classification accuracy of 80.4%. On the independent testing dataset curated from SCOP2.06, the classification accuracy is 77.0%. We compare our method with a top profile profile alignment method - HHSearch on hard template-based and template-free modeling targets of CASP9-12 in terms of fold recognition accuracy. The accuracy of our method is 14.5%-29.1% higher than HHSearch on template-free modeling targets and 4.5%-16.7% higher on hard template-based modeling targets for top 1, 5, and 10 predicted folds. The hidden features extracted from sequence by our method is robust against sequence mutation, insertion, deletion and truncation, and can be used for other protein pattern recognition problems such as protein clustering, comparison and ranking.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01010v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Exciton transport in the PE545 complex: insight from atomistic QM/MM-based quantum master equations and elastic network models', ['Sima Pouyandeh', 'Stefano Iubini', 'Sandro Jurinovich', 'Yasser Omar', 'Benedetta Mennucci', 'Francesco Piazza'], u'2017-05-29', u'In this paper we work out a parameterization of the environment noise within the Haken-Strobl-Reinenker (HSR) model for the PE545 light-harvesting complex based on atomic-level quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations. We use this approach to investigate the role of different auto- and cross-correlations in the HSR noise tensor, confirming that site-energy autocorrelations (pure dephasing) terms dominate the noise-induced exciton mobility enhancement, followed by site energy-coupling cross-correlations for specific triplets of pigments. Interestingly, several cross-correlations of the latter kind, together with coupling-coupling cross-correlations, display clear low-frequency signatures in their spectral densities in the region 30-70 inverse centimeters. These slow components lie at the limits of validity of the HSR approach, requiring that environmental fluctuations be faster than typical exciton transfer time scales. We show that a simple coarse-grained elastic-network-model (ENM) analysis of the PE545 protein naturally spotlights collective normal modes in this frequency range, that represent specific concerted motions of the subnetwork of cysteines that are covalenty linked to the pigments. This analysis strongly suggests that protein scaffolds in light-harvesting complexes are able to express specific collective, low-frequency normal modes providing a fold-rooted blueprint of exciton transport pathways. We speculate that ENM-based mixed quantum classical methods, such as Ehrenfest dynamics, might be promising tools to disentangle the fundamental designing principles of these dynamical processes in natural and artificial light-harvesting structures.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01306v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]

[u'Neuro-RAM Unit with Applications to Similarity Testing and Compression in Spiking Neural Networks', ['Nancy Lynch', 'Cameron Musco', 'Merav Parter'], u'2017-06-05', u"We study distributed algorithms implemented in a simplified but biologically plausible model for stochastic spiking neural networks. We focus on tradeoffs between computation time and network complexity, along with the role of randomness in efficient neural computation. It is widely accepted that neural computation is inherently stochastic. In recent work, we explored how this stochasticity could be leveraged to solve the `winner-take-all' leader election task. Here, we focus on using randomness in neural algorithms for similarity testing and compression. In the most basic setting, given two $n$-length patterns of firing neurons, we wish to distinguish if the patterns are equal or $\\epsilon$-far from equal. Randomization allows us to solve this task with a very compact network, using $O \\left (\\frac{\\sqrt{n}\\log n}{\\epsilon}\\right)$ auxiliary neurons, which is sublinear in the input size. At the heart of our solution is the design of a $t$-round neural random access memory, or indexing network, which we call a neuro-RAM. This module can be implemented with $O(n/t)$ auxiliary neurons and is useful in many applications beyond similarity testing. Using a combination of Yao's minimax principle and a VC dimension-based argument, we show that the tradeoff between runtime and network size in our neuro-RAM is nearly optimal. Our result has several implications -- since our neuro-RAM construction can be implemented with deterministic threshold gates, it demonstrates that, in contrast to similarity testing, randomness does not provide significant computational advantages for this problem. It also establishes a separation between our networks, which spike with a sigmoidal probability function, and well-studied but less biologically plausible deterministic sigmoidal networks, whose gates output real number values, and which can implement a neuro-RAM much more efficiently.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01382v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Creative Foraging: A Quantitative Paradigm for Studying Creative Exploration', ['Yuval Hart', 'Avraham E Mayo', 'Ruth Mayo', 'Liron Rozenkrantz', 'Avichai Tendler', 'Uri Alon', 'Lior Noy'], u'2017-06-05', u'Creative exploration is central to science, art and cognitive development. However, research on creative exploration is limited by a lack of high-resolution automated paradigms. To address this, we present such an automated paradigm, the creative foraging game, in which people search for novel and valuable solutions in a large and well-defined space made of all possible shapes made of ten connected squares. Players discovered shape categories such as digits, letters, and airplanes. They exploited each category, then dropped it to explore once again, and so on. Aligned with a prediction of optimal foraging theory (OFT) prediction, during exploration phases, people moved along meandering paths that are about three times longer than the minimal paths between shapes, when exploiting a category of related shapes, they moved along the minimal paths. The moment of discovery of a new category was usually done at a nonprototypical and ambiguous shape, which can serve as an experimental proxy for creative leaps. People showed individual differences in their search patterns, along a continuum between two strategies: a mercurial quick-to-discover/quick-to-drop strategy and a thorough slow-to-discover/slow-to-drop strategy. Contrary to optimal foraging theory, players leave exploitation to explore again far before categories are depleted. This paradigm opens the way for automated high-resolution study of creative exploration.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01249v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

In this second part, we complete our analysis by presenting a symmetrized version of the experiment, still violating the CHSH inequality but now also obeying the marginal law, for which we provide a full quantum modeling in Hilbert space, using a singlet state and suitably chosen product measurements. We also address some of the criticisms that have been recently directed at experiments of this kind, according to which they would not highlight the presence of genuine forms of entanglement. We explain that these criticisms are based on a view of entanglement that is too restrictive, thus unable to capture all possible ways physical and conceptual entities can connect and form systems behaving as a whole. We also provide an example of a mechanical model showing that the violations of the marginal law and Bell inequalities are generally to be associated with different mechanisms.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01188v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Effects of electrical and optogenetic deep brain stimulation on synchronized oscillatory activity in Parkinsonian basal ganglia', ['Shivakeshavan Ratnadurai-Giridharan', 'Chung Cheung', 'Leonid Rubchinsky'], u'2017-06-03', u'Conventional deep brain stimulation (DBS) of basal ganglia uses high-frequency regular electrical pulses to treat Parkinsonian motor symptoms and has a series of limitations. Relatively new and not yet clinically tested optogenetic stimulation is an effective experimental stimulation technique to affect pathological network dynamics. We compared the effects of electrical and optogenetic stimulation of the basal ganglia on the pathological parkinsonian rhythmic neural activity. We studied the network response to electrical stimulation and excitatory and inhibitory optogenetic stimulations. Different stimulations exhibit different interactions with pathological activity in the network. We studied these interactions for different network and stimulation parameter values. Optogenetic stimulation was found to be more efficient than electrical stimulation in suppressing pathological rhythmicity. Our findings indicate that optogenetic control of neural synchrony may be more efficacious than electrical control because of the different ways of how stimulations interact with network dynamics.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00976v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Multiple Kernel Learning and Automatic Subspace Relevance Determination for High-dimensional Neuroimaging Data', ['Murat Seckin Ayhan', 'Vijay Raghavan', "Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative"], u'2017-06-02', u"Alzheimer's disease is a major cause of dementia. Its diagnosis requires accurate biomarkers that are sensitive to disease stages. In this respect, we regard probabilistic classification as a method of designing a probabilistic biomarker for disease staging. Probabilistic biomarkers naturally support the interpretation of decisions and evaluation of uncertainty associated with them. In this paper, we obtain probabilistic biomarkers via Gaussian Processes. Gaussian Processes enable probabilistic kernel machines that offer flexible means to accomplish Multiple Kernel Learning. Exploiting this flexibility, we propose a new variation of Automatic Relevance Determination and tackle the challenges of high dimensionality through multiple kernels. Our research results demonstrate that the Gaussian Process models are competitive with or better than the well-known Support Vector Machine in terms of classification performance even in the cases of single kernel learning. Extending the basic scheme towards the Multiple Kernel Learning, we improve the efficacy of the Gaussian Process models and their interpretability in terms of the known anatomical correlates of the disease. For instance, the disease pathology starts in and around the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. Through the use of Gaussian Processes and Multiple Kernel Learning, we have automatically and efficiently determined those portions of neuroimaging data. In addition to their interpretability, our Gaussian Process models are competitive with recent deep learning solutions under similar settings.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00856v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Unsupervised Learning of Spike Patterns for Seizure Detection and Wavefront Estimation of High Resolution Micro Electrocorticographic (\u03bcECoG) Data', ['Yilin Song', 'Jonathan Viventi', 'Yao Wang'], u'2017-06-02', u'For the past few years, we have developed flexible, active, multiplexed recording devices for high resolution recording over large, clinically relevant areas in the brain. While this technology has enabled a much higher-resolution view of the electrical activity of the brain, the analytical methods to process, categorize and respond to the huge volumes of seizure data produced by these devices have not yet been developed. In this work we proposed an unsupervised learning framework for spike analysis, which by itself reveals spike pattern. By applying advanced video processing techniques for separating a multi-channel recording into individual spike segments, unfolding the spike segments manifold and identifying natural clusters for spike patterns, we are able to find the common spike motion patterns. And we further explored using these patterns for more interesting and practical problems as seizure prediction and spike wavefront prediction. These methods have been applied to in-vivo feline seizure recordings and yielded promising results.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00780v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

A partial differential equation governing the evolution of the DNA population is derived as a kind of diffusion equation on A*. Analyzing the constructed model in a theoretical manner, we present conditions for sympatric speciation, the possibility of which continues to be discussed. It is shown that under other same conditions one condition determines whether sympatric speciation occurs or the DNA population continues to move around randomly in a subset of A*. We next demonstrate that the population maintains a kind of equlibrium state under certain conditions. In this situation, the population remains nearly unchanged and does not differentiate even if it can differentiate into others. Furthermore, we calculate the probability of sympatric speciation and the time expected to elapse before it.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01182v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Widespread punctuated evolution in microbial communities', ['Alice Doucet Beaupre', "James P. O'Dwyer"], u'2017-06-04', u'Until recently, much of the microbial world was hidden from view. A global research effort has changed this, unveiling and quantifying microbial diversity across enormous range of critically-important contexts, from the human microbiome, to plant-soil interactions, to marine life. Yet what has remained largely hidden is the interplay of ecological and evolutionary processes that led to the diversity we observe in the present day. We introduce a theoretical framework to quantify the effect of ecological innovations in microbial evolutionary history, using a new, coarse-grained approach that is robust to the incompleteness and ambiguities in microbial community data. Applying this methodology, we identify a balance of gradual, ongoing diversification and rapid bursts across a vast range of microbial habitats. Moreover, we find universal quantitative similarities in the tempo of diversification, independent of habitat type.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01138v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'The split-and-drift random graph, a null model for speciation', ['Francois Bienvenu', 'Florence Debarre', 'Amaury Lambert'], u'2017-06-04', u'We introduce a new random graph model motivated by biological questions relating to speciation. This random graph is defined as the stationary distribution of a Markov chain on the space of graphs on $\\{1, \\ldots, n\\}$. The dynamics of this Markov chain is governed by two types of events: vertex duplication, where at constant rate a pair of vertices is sampled uniformly, one of these vertices loses its incident edges and is rewired to the other vertex and its neighbors; and edge removal, where each edge disappears at constant rate. Besides the number of vertices $n$, the model has a single parameter $r_n$. Using a coalescent approach, we obtain explicit formulas for the first moments of several graph invariants such as the number of edges or the number of complete subgraphs of order $k$. These are then used to identify five non-trivial regimes depending on the asymptotics of the parameter $r_n$. We derive an explicit expression for the degree distribution, and show that under appropriate rescaling it converges to classical distributions when the number of vertices goes to infinity. Finally, we give asymptotic bounds for the number of connected components, and show that in the sparse regime the number of edges is Poissonian.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01015v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Estimating the prevalence of infectious diseases from under-reported age-dependent compulsorily notification databases', ['Marcos Amaku', 'Marcelo Nascimento Burattini', 'Eleazar Chaib', 'Francisco Antonio Bezerra Coutinho', 'David Greenhalgh', 'Luis Fernandez Lopez', 'Eduardo Massad'], u'2017-06-02', u'Background: National or local laws, norms or regulations (sometimes and in some countries) require medical providers to report notifiable diseases to public health authorities. Reporting, however, is almost always incomplete. This is due to a variety of reasons, ranging from not recognizing the diseased to failures in the technical or administrative steps leading to the final official register in the disease notification system. The reported fraction varies from 9% to 99% and is strongly associated with the disease being reported. Methods: In this paper we propose a method to approximately estimate the full prevalence (and any other variable or parameter related to transmission intensity) of infectious diseases. The model assumes incomplete notification of incidence and allows the estimation of the non-notified number of infections and it is illustrated by the case of hepatitis C in Brazil. The method has the advantage that it can be corrected iteratively by comparing its findings with empirical results. Results: The application of the model for the case of hepatitis C in Brazil resulted in a prevalence of notified cases that varied between 163,902 and 169,382 cases; a prevalence of non-notified cases that varied between 1,433,638 and 1,446,771; and a total prevalence of infections that varied between 1,597,540 and 1,616,153 cases. Conclusions: We conclude that that the model proposed can be useful for estimation of the actual magnitude of endemic states of infectious diseases, particularly for those where the number of notified cases is only the tip of the iceberg. In addition, the method can be applied to other situations, such as the well known underreported incidence of criminality (for example rape), among others.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00804v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

The success of ODE-based approaches has, however, been limited, due to the difficulty in estimating parameters and by their lack of scalability. Here we introduce a novel method and pipeline to reverse engineer gene regulatory networks from gene expression of time series and perturbation data based upon an improvement on the calculation scheme of the derivatives and a pre-filtration step to reduce the number of possible links. The method introduces a linear differential equation model with adaptive numerical differentiation that is scalable to extremely large regulatory networks. We demonstrate the ability of this method to outperform current state-of-the-art methods applied to experimental and synthetic data using test data from the DREAM4 and DREAM5 challenges. Our method displays greater accuracy and scalability. We benchmark the performance of the pipeline with respect to data set size and levels of noise.

[u'Asymptotic scaling properties of the posterior mean and variance in the Gaussian scale mixture model', ['Rodrigo Echeveste', 'Guillaume Hennequin', 'Mate Lengyel'], u'2017-06-03', u'The Gaussian scale mixture model (GSM) is a simple yet powerful probabilistic generative model of natural image patches. In line with the well-established idea that sensory processing is adapted to the statistics of the natural environment, the GSM has also been considered a model of the early visual system, as a reasonable "first-order" approximation to the internal model that the primary visual cortex (V1) inverts. According to this view, neural activities in V1 represent the posterior distribution under the GSM given a particular visual stimulus. Indeed, (approximate) inference under the GSM has successfully accounted for various nonlinearities in the mean (trial-average) responses of V1 neurons, as well as the dependence of (across-trial) response variability with stimulus contrast found in V1 recordings. However, previous work almost exclusively relied on numerical simulations to obtain these results. Thus, for a deeper insight into the realm of possible behaviours the GSM can (and cannot) exhibit and predict, here we present analytical derivations for the limiting behaviour of the mean and (co)variance of the GSM posterior at very low and high contrast levels. These results should guide future work exploring neural circuit dynamics appropriate for implementing inference under the GSM.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00925v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Semi-supervised network inference with time course data and dynamic regression simulation', ['Phan Nguyen', 'Rosemary Braun'], u'2017-06-03', u'Motivation: Inferring the structure of gene regulatory networks from high--throughput datasets remains an important and unsolved problem. Current methods are hampered by problems such as noise, low sample size, and incomplete characterizations of regulatory dynamics, leading to networks with missing and anomalous links. Integration of prior network information (e.g., from pathway databases) has the potential to improve reconstructions. Results: We developed a semi--supervised network reconstruction algorithm that enables the synthesis of information from partially known networks with time course gene expression data. We adapted PLS-VIP for time course data and used reference networks to simulate expression data from which null distributions of VIP scores are generated and used to estimate edge probabilities for input expression data. By using simulated dynamics to generate reference distributions, this approach incorporates previously known regulatory relationships and links the network to the dynamics to form a semi-supervised approach that discovers novel and anomalous connections. We applied this approach to data from a sleep deprivation study with KEGG pathways treated as prior networks, as well as to synthetic data from several DREAM challenges, and find that it is able to recover many of the true edges and identify errors in these networks, suggesting its ability to derive posterior networks that accurately reflect gene expression dynamics.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00877v1', ['Quantitative Methods', 'Molecular Networks'], []]
[u'Steady diffusion in a drift field: a comparison of large deviation techniques and multiple-scale analysis', ['Erik Aurell', 'Stefano Bo'], u'2017-06-02', u'A particle with internal unobserved states diffusing in a force field will generally display effective advection-diffusion. The drift velocity is proportional to the mobility averaged over the internal states, or effective mobility, while the effective diffusion has two terms. One is of the equilibrium type and satisfies an Einstein relation with the effective mobility while the other is quadratic in the applied force. In this contribution we present two new methods to obtain these results, on the one hand using large deviation techniques, and on the other by a multiple-scale analysis, and compare the two. We consider both systems with discrete internal states and continuous internal states. We show that the auxiliary equations in the multiple-scale analysis can also be derived in second-order perturbation theory in a large deviation theory of a generating function (discrete internal states) or generating functional (continuous internal states). We discuss that measuring the two components of the effective diffusion give a way to determine kinetic rates from only first and second moments of the displacement in steady state.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00784v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]

The manual delineation of WMHs is tedious, costly and time consuming. This is further complicated by the fact that other pathological features (i.e. stroke lesions) often also appear as hyperintense. Several automated methods aiming to tackle the challenges of WMH segmentation have been proposed, however cannot differentiate between WMH and strokes. Other methods, capable of distinguishing between different pathologies in brain MRI, are not designed with simultaneous WMH and stroke segmentation in mind. In this work we propose to use a convolutional neural network (CNN) that is able to segment hyperintensities and differentiate between WMHs and stroke lesions. Specifically, we aim to distinguish between WMH pathologies from those caused by stroke lesions due to either cortical, large or small subcortical infarcts. As far as we know, this is the first time such differentiation task has explicitly been proposed. The proposed fully convolutional CNN architecture, is comprised of an analysis path, that gradually learns low and high level features, followed by a synthesis path, that gradually combines and up-samples the low and high level features into a class likelihood semantic segmentation. Quantitatively, the proposed CNN architecture is shown to outperform other well established and state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of overlap with manual expert annotations. Clinically, the extracted WMH volumes were found to correlate better with the Fazekas visual rating score. Additionally, a comparison of the associations found between clinical risk-factors and the WMH volumes generated by the proposed method, were found to be in line with the associations found with the expert-annotated volumes.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00935v1', ['Tissues and Organs'], []]
