[u'Protein Secondary Structure Prediction Using Deep Multi-scale\n  Convolutional Neural Networks and Next-Step Conditioning', ['Akosua Busia', 'Jasmine Collins', 'Navdeep Jaitly'], u'2016-11-04', u"Recently developed deep learning techniques have significantly improved the\naccuracy of various speech and image recognition systems. In this paper we\nadapt some of these techniques for protein secondary structure prediction. We\nfirst train a series of deep neural networks to predict eight-class secondary\nstructure labels given a protein's amino acid sequence information and find\nthat using recent methods for regularization, such as dropout and weight-norm\nconstraining, leads to measurable gains in accuracy. We then adapt recent\nconvolutional neural network architectures--Inception, ReSNet, and DenseNet\nwith Batch Normalization--to the problem of protein structure prediction. These\nconvolutional architectures make heavy use of multi-scale filter layers that\nsimultaneously compute features on several scales, and use residual connections\nto prevent underfitting. Using a carefully modified version of these\narchitectures, we achieve state-of-the-art performance of 70.0% per amino acid\naccuracy on the public CB513 benchmark dataset. Finally, we explore additions\nfrom sequence-to-sequence learning, altering the model to make its predictions\nconditioned on both the protein's amino acid sequence and its past secondary\nstructure labels. We introduce a new method of ensembling such a conditional\nmodel with our convolutional model, an approach which reaches 70.6% Q8 accuracy\non CB513. We argue that these results can be further refined for larger boosts\nin prediction accuracy through more sophisticated attempts to control\noverfitting of conditional models. We aim to release the code for these\nexperiments as part of the TensorFlow repository.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01503v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'RBPBind: Quantitative prediction of Protein-RNA Interactions', ['Jeff Gaither', 'Yi-Hsuan Lin', 'Ralf Bundschuh'], u'2016-11-04', u'Summary: We introduce RBPBind, a web-based tool for the quantitative\nprediction of RNA-protein interactions. Given a user-specified RNA and a\nprotein selected from a set of several common RNA-binding proteins, RBPBind\ncomputes the binding curve and effective binding constant of the reaction in\nquestion. The server also computes the probability that, at a given\nconcentration of protein, a protein molecule will bind to any particular\nnucleotide along the RNA. The software for RBPBind is adapted from the Vienna\nRNA package, whose source code has been modified to accommodate the effects of\nsingle stranded RNA binding proteins. RBPBind thus fully incorporates the\neffect of RNA secondary structure on protein-RNA interactions.

[u'Bayesian Modeling of Motion Perception using Dynamical Stochastic\n  Textures', ['Jonathan Vacher', 'Andrew Isaac Meso', 'Laurent U. Perrinet', 'Gabriel Peyre'], u'2016-11-02', u'A common practice to account for psychophysical biases in vision is to frame\nthem as consequences of a dynamic process relying on optimal inference with\nrespect to a generative model. The present study details the complete\nformulation of such a generative model intended to probe visual motion\nperception. It is first derived in a set of axiomatic steps constrained by\nbiological plausibility. We then extend previous contributions by detailing\nthree equivalent formulations of the Gaussian dynamic texture model. First, the\ncomposite dynamic textures are constructed by the random aggregation of warped\npatterns, which can be viewed as 3D Gaussian fields. Second, these textures are\ncast as solutions to a stochastic partial differential equation (sPDE). This\nessential step enables real time, on-the-fly, texture synthesis using\ntime-discretized auto- regressive processes. It also allows for the derivation\nof a local motion-energy model, which corresponds to the log-likelihood of the\nprobability density. The log-likelihoods are finally essential for the\nconstruction of a Bayesian inference framework. We use the model to probe speed\nperception in humans psychophysically using zoom-like changes in stimulus\nspatial frequency content. The likelihood is contained within the genera- tive\nmodel and we chose a slow speed prior consistent with previous literature. We\nthen validated the fitting process of the model using synthesized data. The\nhuman data replicates previous findings that relative perceived speed is\npositively biased by spatial frequency increments. The effect cannot be fully\naccounted for by previous models, but the current prior acting on the\nspatio-temporal likelihoods has proved necessary in accounting for the\nperceptual bias.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01390v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Recovering the Brownian Coalescent Point Process from the Kingman\n  Coalescent by Conditional Sampling', ['Amaury Lambert', 'Emmanuel Schertzer'], u'2016-11-04', u'We consider a continuous population whose dynamics is described by the\nstandard stationary Fleming-Viot process, so that the genealogy of $n$\nuniformly sampled individuals is distributed as the Kingman $n$-coalescent. In\nthis note, we study some genealogical properties of this population when the\nsample is conditioned to fall entirely into a subpopulation with most recent\ncommon ancestor (MRCA) shorter than $\\varepsilon$. First, using the comb\nrepresentation of the total genealogy (Lambert & Uribe Bravo 2016), we show\nthat the genealogy of the descendance of the MRCA of the sample on the\ntimescale $\\varepsilon$ converges as $\\varepsilon\\to 0$. The limit is the\nso-called Brownian coalescent point process (CPP) stopped at an independent\nGamma random variable with parameter $n$, which can be seen as the genealogy at\na large time of the total population of a rescaled critical birth-death\nprocess, biased by the $n$-th power of its size. Secondly, we show that in this\nlimit the coalescence times of the $n$ sampled individuals are i.i.d. uniform\nrandom variables in $(0,1)$. These results provide a coupling between two\nstandard models for the genealogy of a random exchangeable population: the\nKingman coalescent and the Brownian CPP.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01323v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u"Can we 'future-proof' consensus trees?", ['David Bryant', 'Andrew Francis', 'Mike Steel'], u'2016-11-03', u"Consensus methods are widely used for combining phylogenetic trees into a\nsingle estimate of the evolutionary tree for a group of species. As more taxa\nare added, the new source trees may begin to tell a different evolutionary\nstory when restricted to the original set of taxa. However, if the new trees,\nrestricted to the original set of taxa, were to agree exactly with the earlier\ntrees, then we might hope that their consensus would either agree with or\nresolve the original consensus tree. In this paper, we ask under what\nconditions consensus methods exist that are 'future proof' in this sense. While\nwe show that some methods (e.g. Adams consensus) have this property for\nspecific types of input, we also establish a rather surprising `no-go' theorem:\nthere is no 'reasonable' consensus method that satisfies the future-proofing\nproperty in general. We then investigate a second notion of 'future proofing'\nfor consensus methods, in which trees (rather than taxa) are added, and\nestablish some positive and negative results. We end with some questions for\nfuture work.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01225v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'From degree-correlated to payoff-correlated activity for an optimal\n  resolution of social dilemmas', ['Alberto Aleta', 'Sandro Meloni', 'Matjaz Perc', 'Yamir Moreno'], u'2016-11-03', u"An active participation of players in evolutionary games depends on several\nfactors, ranging from personal stakes to the properties of the interaction\nnetwork. Diverse activity patterns thus have to be taken into account when\nstudying the evolution of cooperation in social dilemmas. Here we study the\nweak prisoner's dilemma game, where the activity of each player is determined\nin a probabilistic manner either by its degree or by its payoff. While\ndegree-correlated activity introduces cascading failures of cooperation that\nare particularly severe on scale-free networks with frequently inactive hubs,\npayoff-correlated activity provides a more nuanced activity profile, which\nultimately hinders systemic breakdowns of cooperation. To determine optimal\nconditions for the evolution of cooperation, we introduce an exponential decay\nto payoff-correlated activity that determines how fast the activity of a player\nreturns to its default state. We show that there exists an intermediate decay\nrate, at which the resolution of the social dilemma is optimal. This can be\nexplained by the emerging activity patterns of players, where the inactivity of\nhubs is compensated effectively by the increased activity of average-degree\nplayers, who through their collective influence in the network sustain a higher\nlevel of cooperation. The sudden drops in the fraction of cooperators observed\nwith degree-correlated activity therefore vanish, and so does the need for the\nlengthy spatiotemporal reorganization of compact cooperative clusters. The\nabsence of such asymmetric dynamic instabilities thus leads to an optimal\nresolution of social dilemmas, especially when the conditions for the evolution\nof cooperation are strongly adverse.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01109v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Vortex arrays and ciliary tangles underlie the feeding-swimming tradeoff\n  in starfish larvae', ['William Gilpin', 'Vivek N. Prakash', 'Manu Prakash'], u'2016-11-03', u'Many marine invertebrates have larval stages covered in linear arrays of\nbeating cilia, which propel the animal while simultaneously entraining\nplanktonic prey. These bands are strongly conserved across taxa spanning four\nmajor superphyla, and they are responsible for the unusual morphologies of many\ninvertebrates. However, few studies have investigated their underlying\nhydrodynamics. Here, we study the ciliary bands of starfish larvae, and\ndiscover a beautiful pattern of slowly-evolving vortices that surrounds the\nswimming animals. Closer inspection of the bands reveals unusual ciliary\n"tangles" analogous to topological defects that break-up and re-form as the\nanimal adjusts its swimming stroke. Quantitative experiments and modeling\nsuggest that these vortices create a physical tradeoff between feeding and\nswimming, which manifests as distinct flow patterns or "eigenstrokes"\nrepresenting each behavior---potentially implicating neuronal control of cilia.\nThis quantitative interplay between larval form and hydrodynamic function\ngeneralizes to other invertebrates, and demonstrates the potential of active\nboundary conditions in other biological and synthetic systems.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01173v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
