[u'Varying the resolution of the Rouse model on temporal and spatial\n  scales: application to multiscale modelling of DNA dynamics', ['Edward Rolls', 'Yuichi Togashi', 'Radek Erban'], u'2016-07-27', u'A multi-resolution bead-spring model for polymer dynamics is developed as a\ngeneralization of the Rouse model. A polymer chain is described using beads of\nvariable sizes connected by springs with variable spring constants. A numerical\nscheme which can use different timesteps to advance the positions of different\nbeads is presented and analyzed. The position of a particular bead is only\nupdated at integer multiples of the timesteps associated with its connecting\nsprings. This approach extends the Rouse model to a multiscale model on both\nspatial and temporal scales, allowing simulations of localized regions of a\npolymer chain with high spatial and temporal resolution, while using a coarser\nmodelling approach to describe the rest of the polymer chain. A method for\nchanging the model resolution on-the-fly is developed using the\nMetropolis-Hastings algorithm. It is shown that this approach maintains key\nstatistics of the end-to-end distance and diffusion of the polymer filament and\nmakes computational savings when applied to a model for the binding of a\nprotein to the DNA filament.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.08062v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'A Multiple Kernel Learning Approach for Human Behavioral Task\n  Classification using STN-LFP Signal', ['Hosein M. Golshan', 'Adam O. Hebb', 'Sara J. Hanrahan', 'Joshua Nedrud', 'Mohammad H. Mahoor'], u'2016-07-27', u'Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) has gained increasing attention as an effective\nmethod to mitigate Parkinsons disease (PD) disorders. Existing DBS systems are\nopen-loop such that the system parameters are not adjusted automatically based\non patients behavior. Classification of human behavior is an important step in\nthe design of the next generation of DBS systems that are closed-loop. This\npaper presents a classification approach to recognize such behavioral tasks\nusing the subthalamic nucleus (STN) Local Field Potential (LFP) signals. In our\napproach, we use the time-frequency representation (spectrogram) of the raw LFP\nsignals recorded from left and right STNs as the feature vectors. Then these\nfeatures are combined together via Support Vector Machines (SVM) with Multiple\nKernel Learning (MKL) formulation. The MKL-based classification method is\nutilized to classify different tasks: button press, mouth movement, speech, and\narm movement. Our experiments show that the lp-norm MKL significantly\noutperforms single kernel SVM-based classifiers in classifying behavioral tasks\nof five subjects even using signals acquired with a low sampling rate of 10 Hz.\nThis leads to a lower computational cost.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.07987v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

[u'The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with migration: evolution with\n  interactions', ['Krzysztof Bartoszek', 'Sylvain Glemin', 'Ingemar Kaj', 'Martin Lascoux'], u'2016-07-27', u'The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process plays a major role in the analysis of the\nevolution of phenotypic traits along phylogenies. The standard OU process\nincludes drift and stabilizing selection and assumes that species evolve\nindependently. However, especially in plants, there is ample evidence of\nhybridization and introgression during evolution. In this work we present a\nstatistical approach with analytical solutions that allows for the inclusion of\nadaptation and migration in a common phylogenetic framework. We furthermore\npresent a detailed simulation study that clearly indicates the adverse effects\nof ignoring migration. Similarity between species due to migration could be\nmisinterpreted as very strong convergent evolution without proper correction\nfor these additional dependencies. Our model can also be useful for studying\nlocal adaptation among populations within the same species. Finally, we show\nthat our model can be interpreted in terms of ecological interactions between\nspecies, providing a general framework for the evolution of traits between\n"interacting" species or populations.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.07970v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Network-Guided Biomarker Discovery', ['Chloe-Agathe Azencott'], u'2016-07-27', u'Identifying measurable genetic indicators (or biomarkers) of a specific\ncondition of a biological system is a key element of precision medicine. Indeed\nit allows to tailor diagnostic, prognostic and treatment choice to individual\ncharacteristics of a patient. In machine learning terms, biomarker discovery\ncan be framed as a feature selection problem on whole-genome data sets.\nHowever, classical feature selection methods are usually underpowered to\nprocess these data sets, which contain orders of magnitude more features than\nsamples. This can be addressed by making the assumption that genetic features\nthat are linked on a biological network are more likely to work jointly towards\nexplaining the phenotype of interest. We review here three families of methods\nfor feature selection that integrate prior knowledge in the form of networks.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.08161v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Spatial probabilistic pulsatility model for enhancing\n  photoplethysmographic imaging systems', ['Robert Amelard', 'David A Clausi', 'Alexander Wong'], u'2016-07-27', u'Photolethysmographic imaging (PPGI) is a widefield non-contact biophotonic\ntechnology able to remotely monitor cardiovascular function over anatomical\nareas. Though spatial context can provide increased physiological insight,\nexisting PPGI systems rely on coarse spatial averaging with no anatomical\npriors for assessing arterial pulsatility. Here, we developed a continuous\nprobabilistic pulsatility model for importance-weighted blood pulse waveform\nextraction. Using a data-driven approach, the model was constructed using a 23\nparticipant sample with large demographic variation (11/12 female/male, age\n11-60 years, BMI 16.4-35.1 kg$\\cdot$m$^{-2}$). Using time-synchronized\nground-truth waveforms, spatial correlation priors were computed and projected\ninto a co-aligned importance-weighted Cartesian space. A modified\nParzen-Rosenblatt kernel density estimation method was used to compute the\ncontinuous resolution-agnostic probabilistic pulsatility model. The model\nidentified locations that consistently exhibited pulsatility across the sample.\nBlood pulse waveform signals extracted with the model exhibited significantly\nstronger temporal correlation ($W=35,p<0.01$) and spectral SNR ($W=31,p<0.01$)\ncompared to uniform spatial averaging. Heart rate estimation was in strong\nagreement with true heart rate ($r^2=0.9619$, error $(\\mu,\\sigma)=(0.52,1.69)$\nbpm).', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.08129v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
