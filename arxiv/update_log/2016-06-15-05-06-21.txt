Weikl', 'Jinglei Hu', 'Guang-Kui Xu', 'Reinhard Lipowsky'], u'2016-06-14', u"The adhesion of cell membranes is mediated by the binding of\nmembrane-anchored receptor and ligand proteins. In this article, we review\nrecent results from simulations and theory that lead to novel insights on how\nthe binding equilibrium and kinetics of these proteins is affected by the\nmembranes and by the membrane anchoring and molecular properties of the\nproteins. Simulations and theory both indicate that the binding equilibrium\nconstant K2D and the on- and off-rate constants of anchored receptors and\nligands in their 'two-dimensional' (2D) membrane environment strongly depend on\nthe membrane roughness from thermally excited shape fluctuations on nanoscales.\nRecent theory corroborated by simulations provides a general relation between\nK2D} and the binding constant K3D of soluble variants of the receptors and\nligands that lack the membrane anchors and are free to diffuse in three\ndimensions (3D).", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04298v1', ['Biomolecules', 'Subcellular Processes'], []]

Utilization of cross-linking chemicals can facilitate\nthe capture and identification of transient or weak interactions of a transient\nnature. Here we describe a detailed methodology for cell culture based\nproteomic approach.

Humans, on the other hand, can\nvery quickly exploit highly rewarding nuances of an environment upon first\ndiscovery. In the brain, such rapid learning is thought to depend on the\nhippocampus and its capacity for episodic memory. Here we investigate whether a\nsimple model of hippocampal episodic control can learn to solve difficult\nsequential decision-making tasks. We demonstrate that it not only attains a\nhighly rewarding strategy significantly faster than state-of-the-art deep\nreinforcement learning algorithms, but also achieves a higher overall reward on\nsome of the more challenging domains.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04460v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Estimating direction in brain-behavior interactions: Proactive and\n  reactive brain states in driving', ['Javier O. Garcia', 'Justin Brooks', 'Scott Kerick', 'Tony Johnson', 'Tim Mullen', 'Jean M. Vettel'], u'2016-06-14', u'Conventional neuroimaging analyses have revealed the computational\nspecificity of localized brain regions, exploiting the power of the subtraction\ntechnique in fMRI and event-related potential analyses in EEG. Moving beyond\nthis convention, many researchers have begun exploring network-based\nneurodynamics and coordination between brain regions as a function of\nbehavioral parameters or environmental statistics; however, most approaches\naverage evoked activity across the experimental session to study task-dependent\nnetworks. Here, we examined on-going oscillatory activity and use a methodology\nto estimate directionality in brain-behavior interactions. After source\nreconstruction, activity within specific frequency bands in a priori regions of\ninterest was linked to continuous behavioral measurements, and we used a\npredictive filtering scheme to estimate the asymmetry between brain-to-behavior\nand behavior-to-brain prediction. We applied this approach to a simulated\ndriving task and examine directed relationships between brain activity and\ncontinuous driving behavior (steering or heading error). Our results indicated\nthat two neuro-behavioral states emerge in this naturalistic environment: a\nProactive brain state that actively plans the response to the sensory\ninformation, and a Reactive brain state that processes incoming information and\nreacts to environmental statistics.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04344v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Evidence for a postreproductive phase in female false killer whales\n  Pseudorca crassidens', ['Theoni Photopoulou', 'Ines M Ferreira', 'Toshio Kasuya', 'Peter B Best', 'Helene Marsh'], u'2016-06-14', u'A substantial postreproductive lifespan (PRLS) is considered to have evolved\nadaptively in females of few mammalian species. Its evolution is thought to be\nfavoured when helping relatives to survive and reproduce outweighs the benefits\nof the female reproducing herself. PRLS has so far only been confirmed in two\nnon-human species, both odontocete cetaceans. We investigate the evidence for\nPRLS in a third such species, the false killer whale, Pseudorca crassidens,\nusing morphological evidence from reproductive tissue and a quantitative\nmeasure of PRLS. We examined specimens from false killer whales from combined\nstrandings (South Africa, 1981) and harvest (Japan 1979-80). We found\nmorphological evidence of changes in the activity of the ovaries in relation to\nage. Ovulation had ceased in 50% of whales over 45 years, and all whales over\n55 years had ovaries classified as postreproductive. We also calculated a\nquantitative measure of PRLS, known as postreproductive representation (PrR).\nPrR for the combined sample was 0.25, whereas the mean of the simulated\ndistribution for PrR under the null hypothesis of no PRLS was 0.03. The 95%\npercentile of the distribution was 0.10 and no simulated value exceeded 0.20.\nThis suggests that PrR was convincingly different from the measures simulated\nunder the null hypothesis. We found compelling morphological and statistical\nevidence for PRLS in South African and Japanese pods of false killer whales,\nestablishing this species as the third non-human mammal in which this\nphenomenon has been convincingly demonstrated in wild populations. Our\nestimates for PrR in false killer whales (0.22-0.44) spanned the single value\navailable for the short-finned pilot whale (0.28) and are comparable to\nestimates for historical or hunter-gather human populations (0.3-0.47).', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04519v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

The\ndirection of rotation of the motors is indirectly regulated by the binding of a\nsingle messenger protein.

[u'A revised model of fluid transport optimization in Physarum polycephalum', ['Vincenzo Bonifaci'], u'2016-06-14', u"Optimization of fluid transport in the slime mold Physarum polycephalum has\nbeen the subject of several modeling efforts in recent literature. Existing\nmodels assume that the tube adaptation mechanism in P. polycephalum's tubular\nnetwork is controlled by the sheer amount of fluid flow through the tubes. We\nput forward the hypothesis that the controlling variable may instead be the\nflow's pressure gradient along the tube. We carry out the stability analysis of\nsuch a revised mathematical model for a parallel-edge network, proving that the\nrevised model supports the global flow-optimizing behavior of the slime mold\nfor a substantially wider class of response functions compared to previous\nmodels. Simulations also suggest that the same conclusion may be valid for\narbitrary network topologies.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04225v1', ['Tissues and Organs'], []]

For this purpose, two types of genetic\ncircuits are designed in order to compare concentrations of the input\ntranscription factor (the desired input) and the protein produced by the\nexpression of target gene (process output). Genetic Relay Switch and Shifted\nSubtractor are proposed and employed to design Discrete Comparator. Also,\nanother type of genetic comparator is presented named Bistable Comparator.\nThese synthetic comparators are used to produce the required amount of the\nprotein that activates the expression of the target gene.

[u'Mechanical stability of bipolar spindle assembly', ['Paolo Malgaretti', 'Sudipto Muhuri'], u'2016-06-14', u'Assembly and stability of mitotic spindle is governed by the interplay of\nvarious intra-cellular forces, e.g. the forces generated by motor proteins by\nsliding overlapping anti-parallel microtubules (MTs) polymerized from the\nopposite centrosomes, the interaction of kinetochores with MTs, and the\ninteraction of MTs with the chromosomes arms. We study the mechanical behavior\nand stability of spindle assembly within the framework of a minimal model which\nincludes all these effects. For this model, we derive a closed--form analytical\nexpression for the force acting between the centrosomes as a function of their\nseparation distance and we show that an effective potential can be associated\nwith the interactions at play. We obtain the stability diagram of spindle\nformation in terms of parameters characterizing the strength of motor sliding,\nrepulsive forces generated by polymerizing MTs, and the forces arising out of\ninteraction of MTs with kinetochores. The stability diagram helps in\nquantifying the relative effects of the different interactions and elucidates\nthe role of motor proteins in formation and inhibition of spindle structures\nduring mitotic cell division. We also predict a regime of bistability for\ncertain parameter range, wherein the spindle structure can be stable for two\ndifferent finite separation distances between centrosomes. This occurrence of\nbistability also suggests mechanical versatility of such self-assembled spindle\nstructures.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04295v1', ['Subcellular Processes'], []]
