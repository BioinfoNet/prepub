[u'How to distinguish conformational selection and induced fit based on\n  chemical relaxation rates', ['Fabian Paul', 'Thomas R. Weikl'], u'2016-09-20', u"Protein binding often involves conformational changes. Important questions\nare whether a conformational change occurs prior to a binding event\n('conformational selection') or after a binding event ('induced fit'), and how\nconformational transition rates can be obtained from experiments. In this\narticle, we present general results for the chemical relaxation rates of\nconformational-selection and induced-fit binding processes that hold for all\nconcentrations of proteins and ligands and, thus, go beyond the standard\npseudo-first-order approximation of large ligand concentration. These results\nallow to distinguish conformational-selection from induced-fit processes - also\nin cases in which such a distinction is not possible under pseudo-first-order\nconditions - and to extract conformational transition rates of proteins from\nchemical relaxation data.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.06021v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Measuring Consciousness', ['Siddhartha Sen'], u'2016-09-20', u'A measurement based formula for consciousness, C, as a function of time t, is\nconstructed. The formula depends on identifying a natural relevant\nself-generated, time-dependent dynamical process inherent in any entity. For\nhuman beings the relevant dynamical process identified is the ensemble of brain\nwaves, observed in EEG measurements, that are represented in the model by their\nmeasured time dependent correlation functions. These correlation functions\ndefine the accessible dynamical state of the brain at any moment of time. From\nthem a time dependent probability function, P(t), is extracted by using a\nmathematical identity. According to information theory, -P(t) log P(t), is a\nmeasure of the information contained in the brain waves. Consciousness, C, is\ndefined by this information theory formula: it is not localized, does not\ndepend on specific hardwire details of the brain, but reflects the information\ncontent present in brain waves. Justifications, based on observational\nevidence, are given for the formula and it is shown that C reflects the degree\nof "awareness" that a person has at a given moment of time. The model explains\nthe observed time delay between when a brain wave is seen to initiate an action\nand when there is awareness that the action has been initiated, in terms of the\nway brain waves processes information. Some testable consequences of the model,\nincluding the role dreaming sleep plays in long term memory storage, are\ndiscussed. It is also shown that non living entities have C=0.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.06069v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Stability Analysis of Population Dynamics Model in Microbial Biofilms\n  with Non-participating Strains', ['Jeet Banerjee', 'Tanvi Ranjan', 'Ritwik Kumar Layek'], u'2016-09-20', u'The existence of phenotypic heterogeneity in single-species bacterial\nbiofilms is well-established in the published literature. However, the modeling\nof population dynamics in biofilms from the viewpoint of social interactions,\ni.e. interplay between heterotypic strains, and the analysis of this kind using\ncontrol theory are not addressed significantly. Therefore, in this paper, we\ntheoretically analyze the population dynamics model in microbial biofilms with\nnon-participating strains (coexisting with public goods producers and\nnon-producers) in the context of evolutionary game theory and nonlinear\ndynamics. Our analysis of the replicator dynamics model is twofold: first\nwithout the inclusion of spatial pattern, and second with the consideration of\ndegree of assortment. In the first case, Lyapunov stability analysis of the\nstable equilibrium point of the proposed replicator system determines (1,0)\n(\'full dominance of cooperators\') as a global asymptotic stable equilibrium\nwhenever the return exceeds the metabolic cost of cooperation. Hence, the\nglobal asymptotic stable nature of (1,0) in the context of non-consideration of\nspatial pattern helps to justify mathematically the adversity in the\neradication of "cooperative enterprise" that is an infectious biofilm. In the\nsecond case, we found non-existence of global asymptotic stability in the\nsystem, and it unveils two additional phenomena - bistability and coexistence.\nIn this context, two inequality conditions are derived for the \'full dominance\nof cooperators\' and coexistence. Therefore, the inclusion of spatial pattern in\nbiofilms with non-competing strains intends conditional dominance of pathogenic\n(with respect to the hosts) public goods producers which can be an effective\nstrategy towards the control of an infectious biofilm with the drug-dependent\nregulation of degree of segregation.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.06107v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'The reproductive number of Zika in municipalities of Antioquia,\n  Colombia: stratifying the potential transmission of an ongoing epidemic', ['Juan Ospina', 'Doracelly Hincapie-Palacio', 'Jesus Ochoa', 'Adriana Molina', 'Guillermo Rua', 'Duban Pajaro', 'Marcela Arrubla', 'Rita Almanza', 'Marlio Paredes', 'Anuj Mubayi'], u'2016-09-19', u'Introduction: Zika epidemic in America was declared a public health emergency\nof international concern after the rapid spread in the region. Stratification\nof the potential transmission of the disease is needed to address the efforts\nsurveillance and disease control. The goal of this research is to compare the\nbasic reproductive number of Zika in different municipalities, from an SIR\nmodel with implicit vector dynamics, based on the daily case reporting data of\nAntioquia, Colombia, the second most affected country after Brazil. Methods: An\nsimple SIR model with implicit vector dynamics was derived and used. The\napproximate solution of the model in terms of individuals recovered in each\ntime unit, allowed to obtain estimate of the model parameters including the\nbasic reproduction number (Ro) and its 95% confidence intervals. These\nparameters were estimated via fitting the solution of the model to the daily\nreported cumulative cases data from the regional surveillance system. Results:\nRo was estimated for 20 municipalities, all located at less than 2200 meters\nabove sea level. From January to April 2016, between 17 and 347 cases were\nreported from these municipalities. Of these, 15 municipalities had a high\npotential for transmission (Ro>1) and 5 had less potential (Ro<1), although in\n3 of these, transmission was later possible because its upper confidence\ninterval of Ro was greater than one. Conclusion: Surveillance and control of\nZika should be directed primarily to municipalities with Ro>1. Furthermore,\nstrategies that will strengthen the detection and management of cases in the\nremaining municipalities should be beneficial to the whole Antioquia region.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05969v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Choosing the observational likelihood in state-space stock assessment\n  models', ['Christoffer Moesgaard Albertsen', 'Anders Nielsen', 'Uffe Hgsbro Thygesen'], u'2016-09-20', u'Data used in stock assessment models result from combinations of biological,\necological, fishery, and sampling processes. Since different types of errors\npropagate through these processes it can be difficult to identify a particular\nfamily of distributions for modelling errors on observations a priori. By\nimplementing several observational likelihoods, modelling both numbers- and\nproportions-at-age, in an age based state-space stock assessment model, we\ncompare the model fit for each choice of likelihood along with the implications\nfor spawning stock biomass and average fishing mortality. We propose using AIC\nintervals based on fitting the full observational model for comparing different\nobservational likelihoods. Using data from four stocks, we show that the model\nfit is improved by modelling the correlation of observations within years.\nHowever, the best choice of observational likelihood differs for different\nstocks, and the choice is important for the short-term conclusions drawn from\nthe assessment model; in particular, the choice can influence total allowable\ncatch advise based on reference points.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.06052v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]

McCaw'], u'2016-09-20', u'Myriad experiments have identified an important role for $\\rm CD8^+$ T cell\nresponse mechanisms in determining recovery from influenza A virus infection.\nAnimal models of influenza infection further implicate multiple elements of the\nimmune response in defining the dynamical characteristics of viral infection.\nTo date, influenza virus models, while capturing particular aspects of the\nnatural infection history, have been unable to reproduce the full gamut of\nobserved viral kinetic behaviour in a single coherent framework. Here, we\nintroduce a mathematical model of influenza viral dynamics incorporating all\nmajor immune components (innate, humoral and cellular) and explore its\nproperties with a particular emphasis on the role of cellular immunity.\nCalibrated against a range of murine data, our model is capable of\nrecapitulating observed viral kinetics from a multitude of experiments.\nImportantly, the model predicts a robust exponential relationship between the\nlevel of effector $\\rm CD8^+$ T cells and recovery time, whereby recovery time\nrapidly decreases to a fixed minimum recovery time with an increasing level of\neffector $\\rm CD8^+$ T cells. We find support for this relationship in recent\nclinical data from influenza A(H7N9) hospitalised patients. The exponential\nrelationship implies that people with a lower level of naive $\\rm CD8^+$ T\ncells may receive significantly more benefit from induction of additional\neffector $\\rm CD8^+$ T cells arising from immunological memory, itself\nestablished through either previous viral infection or T cell-based vaccines.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05977v1', ['Cell Behavior'], []]
