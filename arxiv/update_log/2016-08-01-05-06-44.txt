[u'Protein stabilisation by polymersome entrapment', ['Denis Cecchin', 'Giuseppe Battaglia'], u'2016-07-29', u'We report the use of synthetic vesicles formed by amphiphilic block\ncopolymers in water (or polymersomes) to encapsulate myoglobin varying the\nvesicle size, and protein concentration. We show that confinement within\npolymersomes leads to a significant improvement in protein stability against\nthermal denaturation up to 95degC at neutral pH, with little or no evidence of\nunfolding or reduced enzymatic activity. The latter parameter actually exhibits\na two-fold increase after thermal cycling when the confined protein\nconcentration is higher than 5% v/v. Our results suggest that nanoscopic\nconfinement is a promising new avenue for the enhanced long-term storage of\nproteins. Moreover, our work has potentially important implications for the\norigin of life, since such compartmentalisation may well have been critical for\nensuring the preservation of early functional proteins under relatively harsh\nconditions, thus playing a key role in the subsequent emergence of primitive\nlife forms.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.08886v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Assessing Functional Neural Connectivity as an Indicator of Cognitive\n  Performance', ['Brian S. Helfer', 'James R. Williamson', 'Benjamin A. Miller', 'Joseph Perricone', 'Thomas F. Quatieri'], u'2016-07-29', u"Studies in recent years have demonstrated that neural organization and\nstructure impact an individual's ability to perform a given task. Specifically,\nindividuals with greater neural efficiency have been shown to outperform those\nwith less organized functional structure. In this work, we compare the\npredictive ability of properties of neural connectivity on a working memory\ntask. We provide two novel approaches for characterizing functional network\nconnectivity from electroencephalography (EEG), and compare these features to\nthe average power across frequency bands in EEG channels. Our first novel\napproach represents functional connectivity structure through the distribution\nof eigenvalues making up channel coherence matrices in multiple frequency\nbands. Our second approach creates a connectivity network at each frequency\nband, and assesses variability in average path lengths of connected components\nand degree across the network. Failures in digit and sentence recall on single\ntrials are detected using a Gaussian classifier for each feature set, at each\nfrequency band. The classifier results are then fused across frequency bands,\nwith the resulting detection performance summarized using the area under the\nreceiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) statistic. Fused AUC results of\n0.63/0.58/0.61 for digit recall failure and 0.58/0.59/0.54 for sentence recall\nfailure are obtained from the connectivity structure, graph variability, and\nchannel power features respectively.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.08891v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Approximate Inference for Time-varying Interactions and Macroscopic\n  Dynamics of Neural Populations', ['Christian Donner', 'Klaus Obermayer', 'Hideaki Shimazaki'], u'2016-07-29', u'The maximum entropy principle has been successfully employed to explain\nstationary spiking activity of a neural population by using fewer parameters,\nsuch as spike-rates of individual neurons and low-order interactions among\nneurons, than the number of possible activity patterns. Modeling activity of\ncortical circuitries in vivo, however, has been challenging because both\nspike-rates and interactions can change according to sensory stimulation,\nbehavior, or an internal state of the brain. However, previous approaches\nmodeling the dynamics of neural interactions suffer from computational cost;\ntherefore, its application was limited to only a dozen neurons. Here by\nintroducing multiple analytic approximation methods to a state-space model of\nneural population activity, we make it possible to estimate dynamic pairwise\ninteractions of up to 60 neurons. More specifically, we applied the\npseudolikelihood approximation to the state-space model, and combined it with\nthe TAP mean-field or Bethe approximation to make the sequential Bayesian\nestimation of the model parameters possible. The large-scale analysis allows us\nto investigate dynamics of macroscopic properties of neural circuitries\nunderlying stimulus processing and behavior. We show that the model accurately\nestimates dynamics of network properties such as sparseness, entropy, and heat\ncapacity by simulated data, and demonstrate utilities of these measures by\nanalyzing activity of monkey V4 neurons.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.08840v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'The Phylogenetic LASSO and the Microbiome', ['Stephen T Rush', 'Christine H Lee', 'Washington Mio', 'Peter T Kim'], u'2016-07-29', u"Scientific investigations that incorporate next generation sequencing involve\nanalyses of high-dimensional data where the need to organize, collate and\ninterpret the outcomes are pressingly important. Currently, data can be\ncollected at the microbiome level leading to the possibility of personalized\nmedicine whereby treatments can be tailored at this scale. In this paper, we\nlay down a statistical framework for this type of analysis with a view toward\nsynthesis of products tailored to individual patients.

[u'Caveat on the Boltzmann distribution function use in biology', ['Carlos Sevcik'], u'2016-07-29', u'Sigmoid semilogarithmic functions with shape of Boltzmann equations, have\nbecome extremely popular to describe diverse biological situations. Part of the\npopularity is due to the easy avail- ability of software which fits Boltzmann\nfunctions to data, without much knowledge of the fitting procedure or the\nstatistical properties of the parameters derived from the procedure. The\npurpose of this paper is to explore the plasticity of the Boltzmann function to\nfit data, some aspects of the optimization procedure to fit the function to\ndata and how to use this plastic function to differentiate the effect of\ntreatment on data and to attest the statistical significance of treatment\neffect on the data.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.08849v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Identifying Unvaccinated Individuals in Canada: A Predictive Model', ['Kevin Dick', 'Ardyn Nordstrom'], u'2016-07-28', u"Recently, the media and public health officials have become increasingly\naware of the rise in anti-vaccine sentiment. Vaccinations have numerous health\nbenefits for immunized individuals as well as for the general public through\nherd immunity. Given the rise in immunization-preventable diseases, a\nconsequence of people opting out of their routine vaccinations, we determined\nthat Canadian health data can identify individuals over the age of 60 who chose\nnot to get vaccinated (80.1% negative predictive value) and individuals under\nthe age of 60 who have recently been vaccinated (96.4% positive predictive\nvalue). Using the 2009-2014 Canadian Community Health Surveys (CCHS), a probit\nmodel identified the variables that were most commonly associated with flu\nvaccination outcomes. Of 1,381 variables, 47 with the most significant marginal\neffects were selected, including the presence of diseases (e.g. diabetes and\ncancer), behavioral characteristics (e.g. smoking and exercise), exposure to\nthe medical system (e.g. whether the individual gets a regular check-up), and a\nperson's living situation (e.g. having young children in the household). These\nvariables were then used to generate a Random Forest classification model,\ntrained on the 2009-2013 dataset, and tested on the 2014 dataset. We achieved\nan overall accuracy of 87.8% between the two final models, each using 25\nclassification trees with bounded depth of 20 nodes, randomly selecting from\nall 47 variables. With the two proposed policies, this model can be leveraged\nto efficiently allocate vaccination promotion efforts. Additionally, it can be\napplied to future surveys, only requiring 3.6% of the variables in the CCHS for\nsuccessful prediction.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.08656v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Stochastic timing in gene expression for simple regulatory strategies', ['Alma Dal Co', 'Marco Cosentino Lagomarsino', 'Michele Caselle', 'Matteo Osella'], u'2016-07-29', u'Timing is essential for many cellular processes, from cellular responses to\nexternal stimuli to the cell cycle and circadian clocks. Many of these\nprocesses are based on gene expression. For example, an activated gene may be\nrequired to reach in a precise time a threshold level of expression that\ntriggers a specific downstream process. However, gene expression is subject to\nstochastic fluctuations, naturally inducing an uncertainty in this\nthreshold-crossing time with potential consequences on biological functions and\nphenotypes. Here, we consider such "timing fluctuations", and we ask how they\ncan be controlled. Our analytical estimates and simulations show that, for an\ninduced gene, timing variability is minimal if the threshold level of\nexpression is approximately half of the steady-state level. Timing fuctuations\ncan be reduced by increasing the transcription rate, while they are insensitive\nto the translation rate. In presence of self-regulatory strategies, we show\nthat self-repression reduces timing noise for threshold levels that have to be\nreached quickly, while selfactivation is optimal at long times. These results\nlay a framework for understanding stochasticity of endogenous systems such as\nthe cell cycle, as well as for the design of synthetic trigger circuits.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.08694v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
