[u'Uncertainty Quantified Computational Analysis of the Energetics of Virus\n  Capsid Assembly', ['Nathan L Clement', 'Muhibur Rasheed', 'Chandrajit L Bajaj'], u'2016-10-03', u'Most of the existing research in assembly pathway prediction/analysis of\nvirus cap- sids makes the simplifying assumption that the configuration of the\nintermediate states can be extracted directly from the final configuration of\nthe entire capsid. This assump- tion does not take into account the\nconformational changes of the constituent proteins as well as minor changes to\nthe binding interfaces that continues throughout the assembly process until\nstabilization. This paper presents a statistical-ensemble based approach which\nprovides sufficient samples of the configurational space for each monomer and\nthe relative local orientation between monomers, to capture the uncertainties\nin their binding and conformations. Furthermore, instead of using larger\ncapsomers (trimers, pentamers) as building blocks, we allow all possible\nsub-assemblies to bind in all pos- sible combinations. We represent this\nassembly graph in two different ways. First, we use the Wilcoxon signed rank\nmeasure to compare the distributions of binding free energy computed on the\nsampled conformations to predict likely pathways. Second, we represent chemical\nequilibrium aspects of the transitions as a Bayesian Factor graph where both\nassociations and dissociations are modeled based on concentrations and the\nbinding free energies. Results from both of these experiments showed\nsignificant departure from those one would obtain if only the static\nconfigurations of the proteins were considered. Hence, we establish the\nimportance of an uncertainty-aware protocol for pathway analysis, and provide a\nstatistical framework as an important first step towards assembly pathway\nprediction with high statistical confidence.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00638v1', ['Biomolecules', 'Quantitative Methods'], []]

Over the last\ndecade, remarkable progress has been made using "single particle" cryo-electron\nmicroscopy (cryo-EM) for this purpose. In cryo-EM, hundreds of thousands of\ntwo-dimensional images are obtained of individual copies of the same particle,\neach held in a thin sheet of ice at some unknown orientation. Each image\ncorresponds to the noisy projection of the particle\'s electron-scattering\ndensity. The reconstruction of a high-resolution image from this data is\ntypically formulated as a nonlinear, non-convex optimization problem for\nunknowns which encode the angular pose and lateral offset of each particle.\nSince there are hundreds of thousands of such parameters, this leads to a very\nCPU-intensive task---limiting both the number of particle images which can be\nprocessed and the number of independent reconstructions which can be carried\nout for the purpose of statistical validation.\n  Here, we propose a deterministic method for high-resolution reconstruction\ngiven a very low resolution initial guess, that requires a predictable and\nrelatively modest amount of computational effort.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00404v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]

Such collective transport could utilize mechanisms which\nemerge from inter-motor interactions in ways that are yet to be fully\nunderstood. Here we combined experimental measurements of two-kinesin transport\nwith a theoretical framework to investigate the functional ramifications of\ninter-motor interactions on individual motor function and collective cargo\ntransport. In contrast to kinesin\'s low sidestepping frequency when present as\na single motor, with exactly two kinesins per cargo, we observed substantial\nmotion perpendicular to the microtubule. Our model captures a\nsurface-associated mode of kinesin, which is only accessible via inter-motor\ninterference in groups, in which kinesin diffuses along the microtubule surface\nand rapidly "hops" between protofilaments without dissociating from the\nmicrotubule. Critically, each kinesin transitions dynamically between the\nactive stepping mode and this weak surface-associated mode enhancing local\nexploration of the microtubule surface, possibly enabling cellular cargos to\novercome macromolecular crowding and to navigate obstacles along microtubule\ntracks without sacrificing overall travel distance.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00184v1', ['Biomolecules', 'Subcellular Processes'], []]

We found that a drag force of ~7 pN was sufficient for tubule\nextraction for vesicles ranging from 1 to 2 um in radius.

[u'Does Occipital Alpha Neurofeedback Require Critical Branching to\n  Causally Influence LTRCs and Deterministic ERPs?', ['Tom Campbell'], u'2016-10-02', u'Critical branching is a form of theoretical interaction between simple units,\nwhich, in the case of the human brain are assumed to be neuronal elements.\nZhigalov, Kaplan, & Palva (Clin Neurophysiol 2016;127:288-89) revealed that\nneurofeedback flash stimulation phase-locked to high-amplitude occipital alpha\ninfluences the stimulus-locked occipital alpha-band averages and the power\nscaling of long-range temporal correlations of alpha-band amplitude\nfluctuations. At first, it might seem that neurofeedback influenced critical\nbranching alongside there being an interaction between ongoing neuronal\nactivity and evoked responses. However, the causal relations between these\nneuronal Long Range Temporal Correlations, sustained attention, and any\navalanche dynamics are called into question, as is the assertion of Zhigalov et\nal. that the neurofeedback flashes are unconsciously processed rather than\ncapturing attention. Uncorrected concerns about false discovery rate and an\nobjective mathematical error in the cited foundational work for the study of\nZhigalov et al. are also raised. Without critical branching, an alternative set\nof illustrative mathematical principles offered a preliminary fit to the\neffects in the data, whereby neurofeedback influenced the deterministic\ncontribution to single-trial flash-evoked event-related potentials separately\nfrom the neurofeedback flash-evoked gain in the amplitude of those\noscillations.

[u'Understanding epileptiform after-discharges as self-terminating\n  transients', ['Gerold Baier', 'Peter N Taylor', 'Yujiang Wang'], u'2016-10-02', u'Electro-cortical activity in patients with epilepsy may show abnormal\nrhythmic transients of different waveforms in response to stimulation. These\ntransients have long been considered important for mapping excitability levels\nin the epileptic brain, but their dynamic mechanism is still not\nwell-understood.\n  To understand the occurrence of abnormal transients dynamically, we use a\nthalamo-cortical neural population model of epileptic spike-wave activity and\nstudy the interaction between slow and fast subsystems.\n  In a reduced version of the thalamo-cortical model, slow wave oscillations\narise from a fold of cycles (FoC) bifurcation. This marks the onset of a region\nof bistability between a high amplitude oscillatory rhythm and a background\nstate. Near the bistability, the model has excitable dynamics, showing\nprolonged rhythmic transients in response to suprathreshold pulse stimulation.\nWe analyse the state space geometry of the bistable and the excitable state,\nand find that the rhythmic transient arises when the impending FoC bifurcation\ndeforms the state space and creates an area of locally reduced attraction to\nthe fixed point. This area allows trajectories to dwell in it for before\nescaping to the stable steady state, thus creating rhythmic transients. In the\nfull thalamo-cortical model, we find a similar FoC bifurcation structure. In\naddition, the (fast) cortical subsystem can undergo a supercritical\nAndronov-Hopf bifurcation to fast spiking. Combined with the slow subsystem\nthis results in transient self-terminating (poly)-spike-wave oscillations.\n  We compare our dynamic mechanism with other mechanisms to generate excitable\ntransients and discuss why our mechanism is well-suited to explain stimulus\ninduced epileptiform activity. We also interpret the proposed excitability\nmechanism in the context of stimulation responses in the epileptic cortex.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00262v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

[u'Biologically feasible deep learning with segregated dendrites', ['Jordan Guergiuev', 'Timothy P. Lillicrap', 'Blake A.

However, current deep learning algorithms are biologically\ninfeasible, because they assume non-spiking units, discontinuous-time, and\nnon-local synaptic weight updates. Here, we build on recent discoveries in\nartificial neural networks to develop a spiking, continuous-time neural network\nmodel that learns to categorize images from the MNIST data-set with local\nsynaptic weight updates. The model achieves this via a three-compartment\ncellular architecture, motivated by neocortical pyramidal cell neurophysiology,\nwherein feedforward sensory information and feedback from higher layers are\nreceived at separate compartments in the neurons. We show that, thanks to the\nseparation of feedforward and feedback information in different dendrites, our\nlearning algorithm can coordinate learning across layers, taking advantage of\nmultilayer architectures to identify abstract categories - the hallmark of deep\nlearning. Our model demonstrates that deep learning can be achieved within a\nbiologically feasible framework using segregated dendritic compartments, which\nmay help to explain the anatomy of neocortical pyramidal neurons.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00161v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

Endothelial cells in the vessel network are viewed as linearly\nelastic spheres and are of two types: vessel elements are contained within the\nnetwork; tip cells are located at endpoints. Tip cells move in response to\nforces due to interactions with neighbouring vessel elements, the local tissue\nenvironment, chemotaxis and a persistence force modeling their tendency to\ncontinue moving in the same direction. Vessel elements experience similar\nforces but not chemotaxis. An angular persistence force representing local\ntissue interactions stabilises buckling instabilities due to proliferation.\nVessel elements proliferate, at rates that depend on their degree of stretch:\nelongated elements proliferate more rapidly than compressed elements. Following\ndivision, new cells are more likely to form new sprouts if the parent vessel is\nhighly compressed and to be incorporated into the parent vessel if it is\nstretched.\n  Model simulations reproduce key features of vasculogenesis. Parameter\nsensitivity analyses reveal significant changes in network size and morphology\non varying the chemotactic sensitivity of tip cells, and the sensitivities of\nthe proliferation rate and sprouting probability to mechanical stretch. Varying\nchemotactic sensitivity also affects network directionality. Branching and\nnetwork density are influenced by the sprouting probability. Glyphs depicting\nmultiple network properties show how network quantities change over time and as\nmodel parameters vary.
