[u'Spontaneous Activity in the Visual Cortex is Organized by Visual Streams', ['Kun-Han Lu', 'Jun Young Jeong', 'Haiguang Wen', 'Zhongming Liu'], u'2017-02-28', u'Large-scale functional networks have been extensively studied using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging. However, the pattern, organization, and function of fine-scale network activity remain largely unknown. Here we characterized the spontaneously emerging visual cortical activity by applying independent component analysis to resting state fMRI signals exclusively within the visual cortex. In this sub-system scale, we observed about 50 spatially independent components that were reproducible within and across subjects, and analyzed their spatial patterns and temporal relationships to reveal the intrinsic parcellation and organization of the visual cortex. We found that the visual cortical parcels were aligned with the steepest gradient of cortical myelination, and organized into functional modules segregated along the dorsal/ventral pathways and foveal/peripheral early visual areas. In contrast, cortical retinotopy, folding, and cytoarchitecture impose limited constraints to the organization of resting state activity. From these findings, we conclude that spontaneous activity patterns in the visual cortex are primarily organized by visual streams, likely reflecting feedback network interactions.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08617v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'The Cognitive Model towards Contour Recognition', ['YongHong Chen'], u'2017-02-24', u'In this paper, we will study the following pattern recognition problem: Every pattern is a 3-dimensional graph, its surface can be split up into some regions, every region is composed of the pixels with the approximately same colour value and the approximately same depth value that is distance to eyes, and there may also be some contours, e.g., literal contours, on a surface of every pattern. For this problem we reveal the inherent laws. Moreover, we establish a cognitive model to reflect the essential characteristics of the recognition of this type of patterns.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08509v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Estimating the reproductive number, total outbreak size, and reporting rates for Zika epidemics in South and Central America', ['Deborah P. Shutt', 'Carrie A. Manore', 'Stephen Pankavich', 'Aaron T. Porter', 'Sara Y. Del Valle'], u'2017-02-27', u'As South and Central American countries prepare for increased birth defects from Zika virus outbreaks and plan for mitigation strategies to minimize ongoing and future outbreaks, understanding important characteristics of Zika outbreaks and how they vary across regions is a challenging and important problem. We developed a mathematical model for the 2015 Zika virus outbreak dynamics in Colombia, El Salvador, and Suriname. We fit the model to publicly available data provided by the Pan American Health Organization, using Approximate Bayesian Computation to estimate parameter distributions and provide uncertainty quantification. An important model input is the at-risk susceptible population, which can vary with a number of factors including climate, elevation, population density, and socio-economic status. We informed this initial condition using the highest historically reported dengue incidence modified by the probable dengue reporting rates in the chosen countries. The model indicated that a country-level analysis was not appropriate for Colombia. We then estimated the basic reproduction number, or the expected number of new human infections arising from a single infected human, to range between 4 and 6 for El Salvador and Suriname with a median of 4.3 and 5.3, respectively. We estimated the reporting rate to be around 16% in El Salvador and 18% in Suriname with estimated total outbreak sizes of 73,395 and 21,647 people, respectively. The uncertainty in parameter estimates highlights a need for research and data collection that will better constrain parameter ranges.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08560v1', ['Populations and Evolution', 'Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Who Constrains the Constraints? Using Maximum Entropy to test the value of Mechanistic Models', ["James P. O'Dwyer", 'Andrew Rominger', 'Xiao Xiao'], u'2017-02-27', u'Ecologists have developed simplified models of large-scale patterns like the species abundance distribution, or species-area relationship, and implicitly we assume in these models that only some subset of mechanisms scale up to impact these predictions. Applications of the maximum entropy principle in ecology has also developed predictions for these patterns, with the goal of making predictions fixed by just a handful of ecological state variables, like total abundance and species richness. But one outstanding question remains: what principle tells us which state variables to constrain? We take the approach of using mechanistic models to inform this choice, thus translating mechanism into a set of state variables. In addition to providing a mechanistic basis for the state variables, our approach isolates exactly what the mechanistic model is telling us over and above the state variables alone, and whether this additional information is useful in explaining empirical data. This provides a general framework for developing robust null hypotheses against which to compare mechanistic models.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08543v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Role-separating ordering in social dilemmas controlled by topological frustration', ['Marco A. Amaral', 'Matjaz Perc', 'Lucas Wardil', 'Attila Szolnoki', 'Elton J. da Silva Junior', 'Jafferson K. L. da Silva'], u'2017-02-27', u'"Three is a crowd" is an old proverb that applies as much to social interactions, as it does to frustrated configurations in statistical physics models. Accordingly, social relations within a triangle deserve special attention. With this motivation, we explore the impact of topological frustration on the evolutionary dynamics of the snowdrift game on a triangular lattice. This topology provides an irreconcilable frustration, which prevents anti-coordination of competing strategies that would be needed for an optimal outcome of the game. By using different strategy updating protocols, we observe complex spatial patterns in dependence on payoff values that are reminiscent to a honeycomb-like organization, which helps to minimize the negative consequence of the topological frustration. We relate the emergence of these patterns to the microscopic dynamics of the evolutionary process, both by means of mean-field approximations and Monte Carlo simulations. For comparison, we also consider the same evolutionary dynamics on the square lattice, where of course the topological frustration is absent. However, with the deletion of diagonal links of the triangular lattice, we can gradually bridge the gap to the square lattice. Interestingly, in this case the level of cooperation in the system is a direct indicator of the level of topological frustration, thus providing a method to determine frustration levels in an arbitrary interaction network.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08542v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Novelty, popularity, and emergent neutrality: bias in the choice of baby names and lessons for analyzing cultural data', ["James P. O'Dwyer", 'Anne Kandler'], u'2017-02-27', u'Neutral evolution assumes that there are no selective forces distinguishing different variants in a population. Despite this striking assumption, many recent studies have sought to assess whether neutrality can provide a good description of different episodes of cultural change. One approach has been to test whether neutral predictions are consistent with observed progeny distributions, recording the number of variants that have produced a given number of new instances within a specified time interval: the classic example is the distribution of baby names registered within a given year. Here we develop new methods to analyze the shape of progeny distributions. Previous work had approximated the neutral progeny distribution as a power law with an exponent varying with population size and innovation rate. Using an overlapping generations model we show that the progeny distribution consists of two phases: a power law phase with an universally-applicable exponent of -3/2, followed by an exponential cut-off for variants with very large numbers of progeny. Maximum likelihood estimations of the model parameters then provide a direct way to parameterize the neutral model. We apply our approach to a data set of baby names from Australia. While neutrality provides a plausible description of the progeny distribution of abundant variants, rare variants deviate from neutrality. This indicates that analyses based on only the most popular variants can provide misleading evidence for underlying transmission hypotheses. To determine whether the progeny distribution is a meaningful statistic to distinguish between different processes of cultural transmission we analyze the effects of novelty biases. We show that a kind of anti-novelty bias, where new variants are at a disadvantage by virtue of their novelty, is able to replicate more closely the complete progeny distribution of the Australian data set.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08506v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Optimal Allocation of Resources for Suppressing Epidemic Spreading on Networks', ['Hanshuang Chen', 'Guofeng Li', 'Haifeng Zhang', 'Zhonghuai Hou'], u'2017-02-26', u'Efficient allocation of limited medical resources is crucial for controlling epidemic spreading on networks. Based on the susceptible-infected-susceptible model, we solve an optimization problem as how best to allocate the limited resources so as to minimize the prevalence, providing that the curing rate of each node is positively correlated to its medical resource. By quenched mean-field theory and heterogeneous mean-field (HMF) theory, we prove that epidemic outbreak will be suppressed to the greatest extent if the curing rate of each node is directly proportional to its degree, under which the effective infection rate $\\lambda$ has a maximal threshold $\\lambda_c^{opt}=1/\\left\\langle k \\right\\rangle$ where $\\left\\langle k \\right\\rangle$ is average degree of the underlying network. For weak infection region ($\\lambda\\gtrsim\\lambda_c^{opt}$), we combine a perturbation theory with Lagrange multiplier method (LMM) to derive the analytical expression of optimal allocation of the curing rates and the corresponding minimized prevalence. For general infection region ($\\lambda>\\lambda_c^{opt}$), the high-dimensional optimization problem is converted into numerically solving low-dimensional nonlinear equations by the HMF theory and LMM. Counterintuitively, in the strong infection region the low-degree nodes should be allocated more medical resources than the high-degree nodes to minimize the prevalence. Finally, we use simulated annealing to validate the theoretical results.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08444v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Single-lead f-wave extraction using diffusion geometry', ['John Malik', 'Neil Reed', 'Chun-Li Wang', 'Hautieng Wu'], u'2017-02-28', u'A novel single-lead f-wave extraction algorithm based on the modern diffusion geometry data analysis framework is proposed. The algorithm is essentially an averaged beat subtraction algorithm, where the ventricular activity template is estimated by combining a newly designed metric, the diffusion distance, and the non-local Euclidean median based on the non-linear manifold setup. To validate the algorithm, two simulation schemes are proposed and tested, and state-of-the-art results are reported. The clinical potential is shown in the real Holter signal, and we introduce a new score to evaluate the performance of the algorithm.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08638v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Graph-Facilitated Resonant Mode Counting in Stochastic Interaction Networks', ['Michael F Adamer', 'Thomas E Woolley', 'Heather A Harrington'], u'2017-02-28', u'Oscillations in a stochastic dynamical system, whose deterministic counterpart has a stable steady state, are a widely reported phenomenon. Traditional methods of finding parameter regimes for stochastically-driven resonances are, however, cumbersome for any but the smallest networks. In this letter we show by example of the Brusselator how to use real root counting algorithms and graph theoretic tools to efficiently determine the number of resonant modes and parameter ranges for stochastic oscillations. We argue that stochastic resonance is a network property by showing that resonant modes only depend on the squared Jacobian matrix $J^2$ , unlike deterministic oscillations which are determined by $J$. By using graph theoretic tools, analysis of stochastic behaviour for larger networks is simplified and chemical reaction networks with multiple resonant modes can be identified easily.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08747v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
[u'Stall force of a cargo driven by N interacting motor proteins', ['Deepak Bhat', 'Manoj Gopalakrishnan'], u'2017-02-28', u'We study a generic one-dimensional model for an intracellular cargo driven by N motor proteins against an external applied force. The model includes motor-cargo and motor-motor interactions. The cargo motion is described by an over-damped Langevin equation, while motor dynamics is specified by hopping rates which follow a local detailed balance condition with respect to change in energy per hopping event. Based on this model, we show that the stall force, the mean external force corresponding to zero mean cargo velocity, is completely independent of the details of the interactions and is, therefore, always equal to the sum of the stall forces of the individual motors. This exact result is arrived on the basis of a simple assumption: the (macroscopic) state of stall of the cargo is analogous to a state of thermodynamic equilibrium, and is characterized by vanishing net probability current between any two microstates, with the latter specified by motor positions relative to the cargo. The corresponding probability distribution of the microstates under stall is also determined. These predictions are in complete agreement with numerical simulations, carried out using specific forms of interaction potentials.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08682v1', ['Subcellular Processes'], []]
