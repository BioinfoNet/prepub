We have also carried out\nprinciple component analysis and find three basics groups: compact globules,\ntadpoles, and extended hinging structures. To validate the adaptive box and our\nforce field choice, we have run limited simulations in a large conventional box\nwith varying force fields and find that our essential results are unchanged.

[u'PCA meets RG', ['Serena Bradde', 'William Bialek'], u'2016-10-30', u'A system with many degrees of freedom can be characterized by a covariance\nmatrix; principal components analysis (PCA) focuses on the eigenvalues of this\nmatrix, hoping to find a lower dimensional description. But when the spectrum\nis nearly continuous, any distinction between components that we keep and those\nthat we ignore becomes arbitrary; it then is natural to ask what happens as we\nvary this arbitrary cutoff. We argue that this problem is analogous to the\nmomentum shell renormalization group (RG). Following this analogy, we can\ndefine relevant and irrelevant operators, where the role of dimensionality is\nplayed by properties of the eigenvalue density. These results also suggest an\napproach to the analysis of real data. As an example, we study neural activity\nin the vertebrate retina as it responds to naturalistic movies, and find\nevidence of behavior controlled by a nontrivial fixed point. Applied to\nfinancial data, our analysis separates modes dominated by sampling noise from a\nsmaller but still macroscopic number of modes described by a non--Gaussian\ndistribution.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09733v1', ['Neurons and Cognition', 'Quantitative Methods'], []]

[u'Fluctuations When Driving Between Nonequilibrium Steady States', ['P. M. Riechers', 'J. P. Crutchfield'], u'2016-10-29', u'Maintained by environmental fluxes, biological systems are thermodynamic\nprocesses that operate far from equilibrium without detailed-balance dynamics.\nYet, they often exhibit well defined nonequilibrium steady states (NESSs). More\nimportantly, critical thermodynamic functionality arises directly from\ntransitions among their NESSs, driven by environmental switching. Here, we\nidentify constraints on excess thermodynamic quantities that ride above the\nNESS housekeeping background. We do this by extending the Crooks fluctuation\ntheorem to transitions among NESSs, without invoking an unphysical dual\ndynamics. This and corresponding integral fluctuation theorems determine how\nmuch work must be expended when controlling systems maintained far from\nequilibrium. This generalizes feedback control theory, showing that Maxwellian\nDemons can leverage mesoscopic-state information to take advantage of the\nexcess energetics in NESS transitions. Altogether, these point to universal\nthermodynamic laws that are immediately applicable to the accessible degrees of\nfreedom within the effective dynamic at any emergent level of hierarchical\norganization. By way of illustration, this readily allows analyzing a\nvoltage-gated sodium ion channel whose molecular conformational dynamics play a\ncritical functional role in propagating action potentials in mammalian neuronal\nmembranes.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09444v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

[u'Evolutionary Fields Can Explain Patterns of High Dimensional Complexity\n  in Ecology', ['James Wilsenach', 'Pietro Landi', 'Cang Hui'], u'2016-10-30', u'One of the properties that make ecological systems so unique is the range of\ncomplex behavioural patterns that can be exhibited by even the simplest\ncommunities with only a few species. Much of this complexity is commonly\nattributed to stochastic factors which have very high-degrees of freedom.\nOrthodox study of the evolution of these simple networks has generally been\nlimited in its ability to explain complexity, since it restricts evolutionary\nadaptation to an inertia-free process with few degrees of freedom in which only\ngradual, moderately complex behaviours are possible. We propose a model\ninspired by particle mediated field phenomena in classical physics in\ncombination with fundamental concepts in adaptation, that suggests that small\nbut high-dimensional chaotic dynamics near to the adaptive trait optimum could\nhelp explain complex properties shared by most ecological datasets, such as\naperiodicity and pink, fractal noise spectra.

Cluster randomized trials (CRT)\ncapture both direct and indirect intervention effects; the latter depends\nheavily on contact networks within and across clusters. We propose a novel\nclass of connectivity-informed trial designs that leverages information about\nsuch networks in order to improve public health impact and preserve ability to\ndetect intervention effects.\n  Methods: We consider CRTs in which the order of enrollment is based on the\ntotal number of ties between individuals across clusters (based either on the\ntotal number of inter-cluster connections or on connections only to untreated\nclusters). We include options analogous both to traditional Parallel and\nStepped Wedge designs. We also allow for control clusters to be "held-back"\nfrom re-randomization for some period. We investigate the performance epidemic\ncontrol and power to detect vaccine effect performance of these designs by\nsimulating vaccination trials during an SEIR-type epidemic using a\nnetwork-structured agent-based model.\n  Results: In our simulations, connectivity-informed designs have lower peak\ninfectiousness than comparable traditional designs and reduce cumulative\nincidence by 20%, but with little impact on time to end of epidemic and reduced\npower to detect differences in incidence across clusters. However even a brief\n"holdback" period restores most of the power lost compared to traditional\napproaches.\n  Conclusion: Incorporating information about cluster connectivity in design of\nCRTs can increase their public health impact, especially in acute outbreak\nsettings, with modest cost in power to detect an effective intervention.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09926v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]

In the fission yeast\ncell cycle, the transition from G2 phase to M phase is triggered by the\nactivation of Cdc13/Cdc2 and Cdc25, and the deactivation of Wee1. Each of these\nthree events involves a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation (PdP) cycle, and\ntogether they form a regulatory circuit with feedback loops. Almost all\nquantitative models for cellular networks in the past have invalid\nthermodynamics due to the assumption of irreversible enzyme kinetics. We\nconstructed a thermodynamically realistic kinetic model of the G2/M circuit,\nand show that the phosphorylation energy ($\\Delta G$), which is determined by\nthe cellular ATP/ADP ratio, critically controls the dynamics and the bistable\nnature of Cdc2 activation. Using fission yeast nucleoplasmic extract (YNPE), we\nare able to experimentally verify our model prediction that increased , being\nsynergistic to the accumulation of Cdc13, drives the activation of Cdc2.\nFurthermore, Cdc2 activation exhibits bistability and hysteresis in response to\nchanges in phosphorylation energy.

Why are two different mechanisms used to perform the same\nfunction? Systematic analysis, without parameter fitting, of kinetic models of\nthe rotary, alternating access and other possible mechanisms suggest that, when\nthe ratio of protons transported per ATP hydrolyzed exceeds one, the\none-at-a-time proton transport by the rotary mechanism is faster than other\npossible mechanisms across a wide range of driving conditions. When the ratio\nis one, there is no intrinsic difference in the free energy landscape between\nmechanisms, and therefore all mechanisms can exhibit the same kinetic\nperformance. To our knowledge all known rotary pumps have an H+:ATP ratio\ngreater than one, and all known alternating access ATP-driven proton pumps have\na ratio of one. Our analysis suggests a possible explanation for this apparent\nrelationship between coupling ratio and mechanism. When the conditions under\nwhich the pump must operate permit a coupling ratio greater than one, the\nrotary mechanism may have been selected for its kinetic advantage.
