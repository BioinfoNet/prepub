[u'The Evolution of Sex through the Baldwin Effect', ['Larry Bull'], u'2016-07-01', u'This paper suggests that the fundamental haploid-diploid cycle of eukaryotic\nsex exploits a rudimentary form of the Baldwin effect. With this explanation\nfor the basic cycle, the other associated phenomena can be explained as\nevolution tuning the amount and frequency of learning experienced by an\norganism. Using the well-known NK model of fitness landscapes it is shown that\nvarying landscape ruggedness varies the benefit of the haploid-diploid cycle,\nwhether based upon endomitosis or syngamy. The utility of mechanisms such as\npre-meiotic doubling and recombination during the cycle are also shown to vary\nwith landscape ruggedness. This view is suggested as underpinning, rather than\ncontradicting, many existing explanations for sex.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00318v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'An approximate stationary solution for multi-allele neutral diffusion\n  with low mutation rates', ['Conrad J. Burden', 'Yurong Tang'], u'2016-07-01', u'We address the problem of determining the stationary distribution of the\nmulti-allelic, neutral-evolution Wright-Fisher model in the diffusion limit. A\nfull solution to this problem for an arbitrary K x K mutation rate matrix\ninvolves solving for the stationary solution of a forward Kolmogorov equation\nover a (K - 1)-dimensional simplex, and remains intractable. In most practical\nsituations mutations rates are slow on the scale of the diffusion limit and the\nsolution is heavily concentrated on the corners and edges of the simplex. In\nthis paper we present a practical approximate solution for slow mutation rates\nin the form of a set of line densities along the edges of the simplex. The\nmethod of solution relies on parameterising the general non-reversible rate\nmatrix as the sum of a reversible part and a set of (K - 1)(K - 2)/2\nindependent terms corresponding to fluxes of probability along closed paths\naround faces of the simplex. The solution is potentially a first step in\nestimat- ing non-reversible evolutionary rate matrices from observed allele\nfrequency spectra.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00104v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Constrained Allocation Flux Balance Analysis', ['Matteo Mori', 'Terence Hwa', 'Olivier C. Martin', 'Andrea De Martino', 'Enzo Marinari'], u'2016-07-01', u'New experimental results on bacterial growth inspire a novel top-down\napproach to study cell metabolism, combining mass balance and proteomic\nconstraints to extend and complement Flux Balance Analysis. We introduce here\nConstrained Allocation Flux Balance Analysis, CAFBA, in which the biosynthetic\ncosts associated to growth are accounted for in an effective way through a\nsingle additional genome-wide constraint. Its roots lie in the experimentally\nobserved pattern of proteome allocation for metabolic functions, allowing to\nbridge regulation and metabolism in a transparent way under the principle of\ngrowth-rate maximization. We provide a simple method to solve CAFBA efficiently\nand propose an "ensemble averaging" procedure to account for unknown protein\ncosts. Applying this approach to modeling E. coli metabolism, we find that, as\nthe growth rate increases, CAFBA solutions cross over from respiratory,\ngrowth-yield maximizing states (preferred at slow growth) to fermentative\nstates with carbon overflow (preferred at fast growth). In addition, CAFBA\nallows for quantitatively accurate predictions on the rate of acetate excretion\nand growth yield based on only 3 parameters determined by empirical growth\nlaws.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00128v1', ['Quantitative Methods', 'Molecular Networks'], []]
[u'Holographic intravital microscopy for 2-D and 3-D imaging intact\n  circulating blood cells in microcapillaries of live mice', ['Kyoohyun Kim', 'Kibaek Choe', 'Inwon Park', 'Pilhan Kim', 'YongKeun Park'], u'2016-07-01', u'Intravital microscopy is an essential tool that reveals behaviours of live\ncells under conditions close to natural physiological states. So far, although\nvarious approaches for imaging cells in vivo have been proposed, most require\nthe use of labelling and also provide only qualitative imaging information.\nHolographic imaging approach based on measuring the refractive index\ndistributions of cells, however, circumvent these problems and offer\nquantitative and label-free imaging capability. Here, we demonstrate in vivo\ntwo- and three-dimensional holographic imaging of circulating blood cells in\nintact microcapillaries of live mice. The measured refractive index\ndistributions of blood cells provide morphological and biochemical properties\nincluding three-dimensional cell shape, haemoglobin concentration, and\nhaemoglobin contents at the individual cell level. With the present method,\nalterations in blood flow dynamics in live healthy and sepsis-model mouse were\nalso investigated.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00120v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Triangles bridge the scales: Quantifying cellular contributions to\n  tissue deformation', ['Matthias Merkel', 'Raphael Etournay', 'Marko Popovic', 'Guillaume Salbreux', 'Suzanne Eaton', 'Frank Julicher'], u'2016-07-01', u'We study the deformation and the remodeling of two-dimensional cellular\nmaterials. Examples are epithelia, which undergo large-scale deformations\nduring the development of a multi-cellular organism. Such large-scale\ndeformations emerge from processes such as cell shape changes, cell\nrearrangements, cell divisions, and cell extrusions. In this article, we\npropose a general framework for the geometry and topology of cellular networks\nbased on a network triangulation. Using this Triangle Method, we exactly\ndecompose large-scale material deformation into contributions from cellular\nprocesses. Interestingly, our approach reveals contributions of correlations\nbetween cellular rotations and elongation to tissue deformation. Using this\nTriangle Method, we discuss tissue remodeling in the developing pupal wing of\nthe fly Drosophila melanogaster.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00357v1', ['Tissues and Organs'], []]
