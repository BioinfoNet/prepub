[u'A comparison of the innate flexibilities of six chains in F$_1$-ATPase\n  with identical secondary and tertiary folds; 3 active enzymes and 3\n  structural proteins', ['Monique M. Tirion'], u'2016-08-09', u'The $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ subunits comprising the hexameric assembly of\nF1-ATPase share a high degree of structural identity, though low primary\nidentity. Each subunit binds nucleotide in similar pockets, yet only $\\beta$\nsubunits are catalytically active. Why? We re-examine their internal symmetry\naxes and observe interesting differences. Dividing each chain into an\nN-terminal head region, a C-terminal foot region, and a central torso, we\nobserve (1) that while the foot and head regions in all chains obtain high and\nsimilar mobility, the torsos obtain different mobility profiles, with the\n$\\beta$ subunits exhibiting a higher motility compared to the $\\alpha$\nsubunits, a trend supported by the crystallographic B-factors. The $\\beta$\nsubunits have greater torso mobility by having fewer distributed, nonlocal\npacking interactions providing a spacious and soft connectivity, and offsetting\nthe resultant softness with local stiffness elements, including an additional\n$\\beta$ sheet. (2) A loop near the nucleotide binding-domain of the $\\beta$\nsubunits, absent in the $\\alpha$ subunits, swings to create a large variation\nin the occlusion of the nucleotide binding region. (3) A combination of the\nsoftest three eigenmodes significantly reduces the RMSD between the open and\nclosed conformations of the $\\beta$ subnits. (4) Comparisons of computed and\nobserved crystallographic B-factors suggest a suppression of a particular\nsymmetry axis in an $\\alpha$ subunit. (5) Unexpectedly, the soft intra-monomer\noscillations pertain to distortions that do not create inter-monomer steric\nclashes in the assembly, suggesting that structural optimization of the\nassembly evolved at all levels of complexity.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.02976v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Escaping Local Optima using Crossover with Emergent or Reinforced\n  Diversity', ['Duc-Cuong Dang', 'Tobias Friedrich', 'Timo Kotzing', 'Martin S. Krejca', 'Per Kristian Lehre', 'Pietro S. Oliveto', 'Dirk Sudholt', 'Andrew M. Sutton'], u'2016-08-10', u'Population diversity is essential for avoiding premature convergence in\nGenetic Algorithms (GAs) and for the effective use of crossover. Yet the\ndynamics of how diversity emerges in populations are not well understood. We\nuse rigorous runtime analysis to gain insight into population dynamics and GA\nperformance for the ($\\mu$+1) GA and the $\\text{Jump}_k$ test function. We show\nthat the interplay of crossover and mutation may serve as a catalyst leading to\na sudden burst of diversity. This leads to improvements of the expected\noptimisation time of order $\\Omega(n/\\log n)$ compared to mutation-only\nalgorithms like (1+1) EA. Moreover, increasing the mutation rate by an\narbitrarily small constant factor can facilitate the generation of diversity,\nleading to speedups of order $\\Omega(n)$. We also compare seven commonly used\ndiversity mechanisms and evaluate their impact on runtime bounds for the\n($\\mu$+1) GA. All previous results in this context only hold for\nunrealistically low crossover probability $p_c=O(k/n)$, while we give analyses\nfor the setting of constant $p_c < 1$ in all but one case.\n  For the typical case of constant $k > 2$ and constant $p_c$, we can compare\nthe resulting expected runtimes for different diversity mechanisms assuming an\noptimal choice of $\\mu$: $O(n^{k-1})$ for duplicate elimination/minim.,\n$O(n^2\\log n)$ for maximising the convex hull, $O(n\\log n)$ for deterministic\ncrowding (assuming $p_c = k/n$), $O(n\\log n)$ for maximising Hamming distance,\n$O(n\\log n)$ for fitness sharing, $O(n\\log n)$ for single-receiver island\nmodel.\n  This proves a sizeable advantage of all variants of the ($\\mu$+1) GA compared\nto (1+1) EA, which requires time $\\Theta(n^k)$. Experiments complement our\ntheoretical findings and further highlight the benefits of crossover and\ndiversity on $\\text{Jump}_k$.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03123v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Detecting non-binomial sex allocation when developmental mortality\n  operates', ['Richard D. Wilkinson', 'Apostolos Kapranas', 'Ian C. W. Hardy'], u'2016-08-10', u'Optimal sex allocation theory is one of the most intricately developed areas\nof evolutionary ecology. Under a range of conditions, particularly under\npopulation sub-division, selection favours sex being allocated to offspring\nnon-randomly, generating non-binomial variances of offspring group sex ratios.\nDetecting non-binomial sex allocation is complicated by stochastic\ndevelopmental mortality, as offspring sex can often only be identified on\nmaturity with the sex of non-maturing offspring remaining unknown. We show that\ncurrent approaches for detecting non-binomiality have limited ability to detect\nnon-binomial sex allocation when developmental mortality has occurred. We\npresent a new procedure using an explicit model of sex allocation and mortality\nand develop a Bayesian model selection approach (available as an R package). We\nuse the double and multiplicative binomial distributions to model over- and\nunder-dispersed sex allocation and show how to calculate Bayes factors for\ncomparing these alternative models to the null hypothesis of binomial sex\nallocation. The ability to detect non-binomial sex allocation is greatly\nincreased, particularly in cases where mortality is common. The use of Bayesian\nmethods allows for the quantification of the evidence in favour of each\nhypothesis, and our modelling approach provides an improved descriptive\ncapability over existing approaches. We use a simulation study to demonstrate\nsubstantial improvements in power for detecting non-binomial sex allocation in\nsituations where current methods fail, and we illustrate the approach in real\nscenarios using empirically obtained datasets on the sexual composition of\ngroups of gregarious parasitoid wasps.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03102v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Uniform spatial distribution of collagen fibril radii within tendon\n  implies local activation of pC-collagen at individual fibrils', ['Andrew D Rutenberg', 'Aidan I Brown', 'Laurent Kreplak'], u'2016-08-10', u'Collagen fibril cross-sectional radii show no systematic variation between\nthe interior and the periphery of fibril bundles, indicating an effectively\nconstant rate of collagen incorporation into fibrils throughout the bundle.\nSuch spatially homogeneous incorporation constrains the extracellular diffusion\nof collagen precursors from sources at the bundle boundary to sinks at the\ngrowing fibrils. With a coarse-grained diffusion equation we determine\nstringent bounds, using parameters extracted from published experimental\nmeasurements of tendon development. From the lack of new fibril formation after\nbirth, we further require that the concentration of diffusing precursors stays\nbelow the critical concentration for fibril nucleation. We find that the\ncombination of the diffusive bound, which requires larger concentrations to\nensure homogeneous fibril radii, and lack of nucleation, which requires lower\nconcentrations, is only marginally consistent with fully-processed collagen\nusing conservative bounds. More realistic bounds may leave no consistent\nconcentrations. Therefore, we propose that unprocessed pC-collagen diffuses\nfrom the bundle periphery followed by local C-proteinase activity and\nsubsequent collagen incorporation at each fibril. We suggest that C-proteinase\nis localized within bundles, at fibril surfaces, during radial fibrillar\ngrowth. The much greater critical concentration of pC-collagen, as compared to\nfully-processed collagen, then provides broad consistency between homogeneous\nfibril radii and the lack of fibril nucleation during fibril growth.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03236v1', ['Tissues and Organs'], []]
[u'Computational Limitations of First-Order Repressor Systems', ['Emma Wentworth', 'John Wentworth'], u'2016-08-10', u'Almost all current approaches for engineering modular logic components in\nsynthetic biology use first-order regulators, including most CRISPR/CAS, TAL,\nzinc finger, and RNA interference systems. Many practitioners understand\nintuitively that second and higher order binding is necessary for scalability,\nand this is easy to show for single-input single-output systems. However, no\nstudy to date has analysed whether a more complex system, utilizing e.g.\nfeedback or error correction, can produce scalable computation from first-order\nregulators. We prove here that first order repressor systems cannot support\nbistability. In the process, we introduce a function G to measure signal\nquality in molecular systems, and we show that G always decreases in dynamic\nfeedback systems as well as static feed-forward logic cascades of first-order\nrepressors. As a result, first order repressors cannot build memory or signal\nbuffering elements. Finally, we suggest G as a potential new property for\ncharacterization of standard biological parts.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03047v1', ['Molecular Networks', 'Subcellular Processes'], []]
