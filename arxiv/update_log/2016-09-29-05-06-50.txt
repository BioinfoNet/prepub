[u'High-Resolution Directed Human Connectomes and the Consensus Connectome\n  Dynamics', ['Balazs Szalkai', 'Csaba Kerepesi', 'Balint Varga', 'Vince Grolmusz'], u'2016-09-28', u'Here we show a method of directing the edges of the connectomes, prepared\nfrom diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) datasets from the human brain. Before the\npresent work, no high-definition directed braingraphs (or connectomes) were\npublished, because the tractography methods in use are not capable of assigning\ndirections to the neural tracts discovered. Previous work on the functional\nconnectomes applied low-resolution functional MRI-detected statistical\ncausality for the assignment of directions of connectomes of typically several\ndozens of vertices. Our method is based on the phenomenon of the "Consensus\nConnectome Dynamics" (CCD), described earlier by our research group. In this\ncontribution, we apply the method to the 423 braingraphs, each with 1015\nvertices, computed from the public release of the Human Connectome Project, and\nwe also made the directed connectomes publicly available at the site\n\\url{http://braingraph.org}. We also show the robustness of our edge directing\nmethod in four independently chosen connectome datasets: we have found that\n86\\% of the edges, which were present in all four datasets, get the very same\ndirections in all datasets; therefore the direction method is robust, it does\nnot depend on the particular choice of the dataset. We think that our present\ncontribution opens up new possibilities in the analysis of the high-definition\nhuman connectome: from now on we can work with a robust assignment of\ndirections of the connections of the human brain.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09036v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

[u'Low-dimensional firing rate dynamics of spiking neuron networks', ['Maurizio Mattia'], u'2016-09-28', u'Starting from a spectral expansion of the Fokker-Plank equation for the\nmembrane potential density in a network of spiking neurons, a low-dimensional\ndynamics of the collective firing rate is derived. As a result a $n$-order\nordinary differential equation for the network activity can be worked out by\ntaking into account the slowest $n$ modes of the expansion. The resulting\nlow-dimensional dynamics naturally takes into account the strength of the\nsynaptic couplings under the hypothesis of a not too fast changing membrane\npotential density. By considering only the two slowest modes, the firing rate\ndynamics is equivalent to the one of a damped oscillator in which the angular\nfrequency and the relaxation time are state-dependent.

[u'A big-data spatial, temporal and network analysis of bovine tuberculosis\n  between wildlife (badgers) and cattle', ['Aristides Moustakas', 'Matthew R Evans'], u'2016-09-28', u'Bovine tuberculosis (TB) poses a serious threat for agricultural industry in\nseveral countries, it involves potential interactions between wildlife and\ncattle and creates societal problems in terms of human-wildlife conflict. This\nstudy addresses connectedness network analysis, the spatial, and temporal\ndynamics of TB between cattle in farms and the European badger (Meles meles)\nusing a large dataset generated by a calibrated agent based model. Results\nshowed that infected network connectedness was lower in badgers than in cattle.\nThe contribution of an infected individual to the mean distance of disease\nspread over time was considerably lower for badger than cattle; badgers mainly\nspread the disease locally while cattle infected both locally and across longer\ndistances. The majority of badger-induced infections occurred when individual\nbadgers leave their home sett, and this was positively correlated with badger\npopulation growth rates. Point pattern analysis indicated aggregation in the\nspatial pattern of TB prevalence in badger setts across all scales. The spatial\ndistribution of farms that were not TB free was aggregated at different scales\nthan the spatial distribution of infected badgers and became random at larger\nscales. The spatial cross correlation between infected badger setts and\ninfected farms revealed that generally infected setts and farms do not coexist\nexcept at few scales. Temporal autocorrelation detected a two year infection\ncycle for badgers, while there was both within the year and longer cycles for\ninfected cattle. Temporal cross correlation indicated that infection cycles in\nbadgers and cattle are negatively correlated.

Due to the Markovian structure of these models, an\nessential building block is the joint distribution of local genealogies, or\nstatistics of these genealogies, at two linked loci in populations of variable\nsize. Here, we present a novel method to compute the joint distribution of the\ntotal length of the genealogical trees at two linked loci for samples of\narbitrary size. To our knowledge, no method to compute this distribution has\nbeen presented in the literature to date. We show that the joint distribution\ncan be obtained from the solution of a certain system of linear hyperbolic\npartial differential equations. We present a numerical algorithm based on the\nMethod of Characteristics that can be used to efficiently and accurately solve\nthe system and compute this distribution.

[u'Gene networks accelerate evolution by fitness landscape learning', ['John Reinitz', 'Sergey Vakulenko', 'Dmitri Grigoriev', 'Andreas Weber'], u'2016-09-28', u'We consider evolution of a large population, where fitness of each organism\nis defined by many phenotypical traits. These traits result from expression of\nmany genes. We propose a new model of gene regulation, where gene expression is\ncontrolled by a gene network with a threshold mechanism and there is a feedback\nbetween that threshold and gene expression. We show that this regulation is\nvery powerful: depending on parameters we can obtain any functional connection\nbetween thresholds and genes. Under general assumptions on fitness we prove\nthat such model organisms are capable, to some extent, to recognize the fitness\nlandscape. That fitness landscape learning sharply reduces the number of\nmutations necessary for adaptation and thus accelerates of evolution. Moreover,\nthis learning increases phenotype robustness with respect to mutations.\nHowever, this acceleration leads to an additional risk since learning procedure\ncan produce errors. Finally evolution acceleration reminds races on a rugged\nhighway: when you speed up, you have more chances to crash. These results\nexplain recent experimental data on anticipation of environment changes by some\norganisms.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08784v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

[u'Expansion under climate change: the genetic consequences', ['Jimmy Garnier', 'Mark Lewis'], u'2016-09-27', u'Range expansion and range shifts are crucial population responses to climate\nchange. Genetic consequences are not well understood but are clearly coupled to\necological dynamics that, in turn, are driven by shifting climate conditions.\nWe model a population with a deterministic reaction-- diffusion model coupled\nto a heterogeneous environment that develops in time due to climate change. We\ndecompose the resulting travelling wave solution into neutral genetic\ncomponents to analyse the spatio-temporal dynamics of its genetic structure.\nOur analysis shows that range expansions and range shifts under slow climate\nchange preserve genetic diversity. This is because slow climate change creates\nrange boundaries that promote spatial mixing of genetic components.\nMathematically , the mixing leads to so-called pushed travelling wave\nsolutions. This mixing phenomenon is not seen in spatially homogeneous\nenvironments, where range expansion reduces genetic diversity through gene\nsurfing arising from pulled travelling wave solutions. However, the\npreservation of diversity is diminished when climate change occurs too quickly.\nUsing diversity indices, we show that fast expansions and range shifts erode\ngenetic diversity more than slow range expansions and range shifts. Our study\nprovides analytical insight into the dynamics of travelling wave solutions in\nheterogeneous environments.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08611v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], [u'CNRS, USMB, Universit\xe9 de Savoie, Universit\xe9 de Chamb\xe9ry']]
[u'Estimating transmission from genetic and epidemiological data: a metric\n  to compare transmission trees', ['Michelle Kendall', 'Diepreye Ayabina', 'Caroline Colijn'], u'2016-09-28', u"Reconstructing who infected whom is a central challenge in analysing\nepidemiological data. Recently, advances in sequencing technology have led to\nincreasing interest in Bayesian approaches to inferring who infected whom using\ngenetic data from pathogens. The logic behind such approaches is that isolates\nthat are nearly genetically identical are more likely to have been recently\ntransmitted than those that are very different. A number of methods have been\ndeveloped to perform this inference. However, testing their convergence,\nexamining posterior sets of transmission trees and comparing methods'\nperformance are challenged by the fact that the object of inference - the\ntransmission tree - is a complicated discrete structure. We introduce a metric\non transmission trees to quantify distances between them. The metric can\naccommodate trees with unsampled individuals, and highlights differences in the\nsource case and in the number of infections per infector. We illustrate its\nperformance on simple simulated scenarios and on posterior transmission trees\nfrom a TB outbreak. We find that the metric reveals where the posterior is\nsensitive to the priors, and where collections of trees are composed of\ndistinct clusters. We use the metric to define median trees summarising these\nclusters. Quantitative tools to compare transmission trees to each other will\nbe required for assessing MCMC convergence, exploring posterior trees and\nbenchmarking diverse methods as this field continues to mature.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09051v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]

For example, while fourfold vertices in real\nfoams are always unstable, it remains unclear whether a simplified vertex model\ndescription has the same behavior. Here, we study vertex stability and the\ndynamics of T1 topological transitions in vertex models. We show that, when all\nedges have the same tension, stationary fourfold vertices in these models do\nindeed always break up. In contrast, when tensions are allowed to depend on\nedge orientation, fourfold vertices can become stable, as is observed in some\nbiological systems. More generally, our formulation of vertex stability leads\nto an improved treatment of T1 transitions in simulations and paves the way for\nstudies of more biologically realistic models that couple topological\ntransitions to the dynamics of regulatory proteins.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08696v1', ['Tissues and Organs'], []]
[u'Modeling generic aspects of ideal fibril formation', ['Denis Michel'], u'2016-09-27', u'Many different proteins self-aggregate into insoluble fibrils growing\napically by reversible addition of elementary building blocks. But beyond this\ncommon principle, the modalities of fibril formation are very disparate, with\nvarious intermediate forms which can be reshuffled by minor modifications of\nphysico-chemical conditions or amino-acid sequences. To bypass this complexity,\nthe multifaceted phenomenon of fibril formation is reduced here to its most\nelementary principles defined for a linear prototype of fibril. Selected\ngeneric features, including nucleation, elongation and conformational\nrecruitment, are modeled using minimalist hypotheses and tools, by separating\nequilibrium from kinetic aspects and in vitro from in vivo conditions. These\nreductionist approaches allow to bring out known and new rudiments, including\nthe kinetic and equilibrium effects of nucleation, the dual influence of\nelongation on nucleation, the kinetic limitations on nucleation and fibril\nnumbers and the accumulation of complexes in vivo by rescue from degradation.\nOverlooked aspects of these processes are also pointed: the exponential\ndistribution of fibril lengths can be recovered using various models because it\nis attributable to randomness only. It is also suggested that the same term\n"critical concentration" is used for different things, involved in either\nnucleation or elongation.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09005v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
