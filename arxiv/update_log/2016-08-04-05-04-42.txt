[u'Modeling the microscopic electrical properties of thrombin binding\n  aptamer (TBA) for label-free biosensors', ['Eleonora Alfinito', 'Lino Reggiani', 'Rosella Cataldo', 'Giorgio De Nunzio', 'Livia Giotta', 'Maria Rachele Guascito'], u'2016-07-12', u'Aptamers are chemically produced oligonucleotides, able to bind a variety of\ntargets such as drugs, proteins and pathogens with high sensitivity and\nselectivity. Therefore, aptamers are largely employed for producing label-free\nbiosensors, with significant applications in diagnostics and drug delivery. In\nparticular, the anti-thrombin aptamers are biomolecules of high interest for\nclinical use, because of their ability to recognize and bind the thrombin\nenzyme. Among them, the DNA 15-mer thrombin-binding aptamer (TBA), has been\nwidely explored concerning both its structure, which was resolved with\ndifferent techniques, and its function, especially about the possibility of\nusing it as the active part of biosensors. This paper proposes a microscopic\nmodel of the electrical properties of TBA and the aptamer-thrombin complex,\ncombining information from both structure and function. The novelty consists in\ndescribing both the aptamer alone and the complex as an impedance network, thus\ngoing deeper inside the issues addressed in an emerging electronics branch\nknown as proteotronics. The theoretical results are compared and validated with\nElectrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy measurements reported in the literature.\nFinally, the model suggests resistance measurements as a novel tool for testing\naptamer-target affinity.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.01269v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]

The response of EGOS makes it suitable to be interfaced\nwith neurons: short-term plasticity is observed at spike voltage as low as 50\nmV (in a par with the amplitude of action potential in neurons) and with a\ntypical response time in the range of tens milliseconds. Human neuroblastoma\nstem cells are adhered and differentiated into neurons on top of EGOS. We\nobserve that the presence of the cells does not alter short-term plasticity of\nthe device.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.01191v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Normalized neural representations of natural odors', ['David Zwicker'], u'2016-08-03', u'The olfactory system removes correlations in natural odors using a network of\ninhibitory neurons in the olfactory bulb. It has been proposed that this\nnetwork integrates the response from all olfactory receptors and inhibits them\nequally. However, how such global inhibition influences the neural\nrepresentations of odors is unclear. Here, we study a simple statistical model\nof this situation, which leads to concentration-invariant, sparse\nrepresentations of the odor composition. We show that the inhibition strength\ncan be tuned to obtain sparse representations that are still useful to\ndiscriminate odors that vary in relative concentration, size, and composition.\nThe model reveals two generic consequences of global inhibition: (i) odors with\nmany molecular species are more difficult to discriminate and (ii) receptor\narrays with heterogeneous sensitivities perform badly. Our work can thus help\nto understand how global inhibition shapes normalized odor representations for\nfurther processing in the brain.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.01179v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'The modular organization of human anatomical brain networks: Accounting\n  for the cost of wiring', ['Richard F. Betzel', 'John D. Medaglia', 'Lia Papadopoulos', 'Graham Baum', 'Ruben Gur', 'Raquel Gur', 'David Roalf', 'Theodore D. Satterthwaite', 'Danielle S. Bassett'], u'2016-08-03', u'Brain networks are expected to be modular. However, existing techniques for\nestimating a network\'s modules make it difficult to assess whether detected\nmodules reflect "true" modular organization or are merely structures that arise\ndue to some other organization principle -- e.g., a drive to reduce wiring\ncost. Here, we present a modification of an existing module detection algorithm\nthat allows us to focus on connections that are unexpected under a strict\ncost-reduction wiring rule and to identify modules from among these\nconnections. We apply this technique to anatomical brain networks and show that\nthe modules we detect differ from those detected using the standard technique.\nWe demonstrate that these novel modules are spatially distributed, exhibit\nunique functional fingerprints, and overlap considerably with rich clubs,\ngiving rise to an alternative interpretation of the functional roles of\nspecific brain regions. Finally, we demonstrate that, using the modified module\ndetection approach, we can detect modules in a developmental dataset that track\nnormative patterns of maturation. Collectively, these findings support the\nhypothesis that brain networks are compoed of modules and provide additional\ninsight into the function of those modules.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.01161v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Cancer treatment scheduling and dynamic heterogeneity in social dilemmas\n  of tumour acidity and vasculature', ['Artem Kaznatcheev', 'Robert Vander Velde', 'Jacob G. Scott', 'David Basanta'], u'2016-08-02', u'Background: Tumours are diverse ecosystems with persistent heterogeneity in\nvarious cancer hallmarks like self-sufficiency of growth factor production for\nangiogenesis and reprogramming of energy-metabolism for aerobic glycolysis.\nThis heterogeneity has consequences for diagnosis, treatment, and disease\nprogression.\n  Methods: We introduce the double goods game to study the dynamics of these\ntraits using evolutionary game theory. We model glycolytic acid production as a\npublic good for all tumour cells and oxygen from vascularization via VEGF\nproduction as a club good benefiting non-glycolytic tumour cells. This results\nin three viable phenotypic strategies: glycolytic, angiogenic, and aerobic\nnon-angiogenic.\n  Results: We classify the dynamics into three qualitatively distinct regimes:\n(1) fully glycolytic, (2) fully angiogenic, or (3) polyclonal in all three cell\ntypes. The third regime allows for dynamic heterogeneity even with linear\ngoods, something that was not possible in prior public good models that\nconsidered glycolysis or growth-factor production in isolation.\n  Conclusion: The cyclic dynamics of the polyclonal regime stress the\nimportance of timing for anti-glycolysis treatments like lonidamine. The\nexistence of qualitatively different dynamic regimes highlights the order\neffects of treatments. In particular, we consider the potential of vascular\nrenormalization as a neoadjuvant therapy before follow up with interventions\nlike buffer therapy.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.00985v1', ['Populations and Evolution', 'Tissues and Organs'], []]
[u'Fuzzy-based Propagation of Prior Knowledge to Improve Large-Scale Image\n  Analysis Pipelines', ['Johannes Stegmaier', 'Ralf Mikut'], u'2016-08-03', u'Many automatically analyzable scientific questions are well-posed and offer a\nvariety of information about the expected outcome a priori. Although often\nbeing neglected, this prior knowledge can be systematically exploited to make\nautomated analysis operations sensitive to a desired phenomenon or to evaluate\nextracted content with respect to this prior knowledge. For instance, the\nperformance of processing operators can be greatly enhanced by a more focused\ndetection strategy and the direct information about the ambiguity inherent in\nthe extracted data. We present a new concept for the estimation and propagation\nof uncertainty involved in image analysis operators. This allows using simple\nprocessing operators that are suitable for analyzing large-scale 3D+t\nmicroscopy images without compromising the result quality. On the foundation of\nfuzzy set theory, we transform available prior knowledge into a mathematical\nrepresentation and extensively use it enhance the result quality of various\nprocessing operators. All presented concepts are illustrated on a typical\nbioimage analysis pipeline comprised of seed point detection, segmentation,\nmultiview fusion and tracking. Furthermore, the functionality of the proposed\napproach is validated on a comprehensive simulated 3D+t benchmark data set that\nmimics embryonic development and on large-scale light-sheet microscopy data of\na zebrafish embryo. The general concept introduced in this contribution\nrepresents a new approach to efficiently exploit prior knowledge to improve the\nresult quality of image analysis pipelines. Especially, the automated analysis\nof terabyte-scale microscopy data will benefit from sophisticated and efficient\nalgorithms that enable a quantitative and fast readout. The generality of the\nconcept, however, makes it also applicable to practically any other field with\nprocessing strategies that are arranged as linear pipelines.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.01276v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
