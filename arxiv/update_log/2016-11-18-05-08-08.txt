[u'Chimera states in uncoupled neurons induced by a multilayer structure', ['Soumen Majhi', 'Matjaz Perc', 'Dibakar Ghosh'], u'2016-11-17', u'Spatial coexistence of coherent and incoherent dynamics in network of coupled\noscillators is called a chimera state. We study such chimera states in a\nnetwork of neurons without any direct interactions but connected through\nanother medium of neurons, forming a multilayer structure. The upper layer is\nthus made up of uncoupled neurons and the lower layer plays the role of a\nmedium through which the neurons in the upper layer share information among\neach other. Hindmarsh-Rose neurons with square wave bursting dynamics are\nconsidered as nodes in both layers. In addition, we also discuss the existence\nof chimera states in presence of inter layer heterogeneity. The neurons in the\nbottom layer are globally connected through electrical synapses, while across\nthe two layers chemical synapses are formed. According to our research, the\ncompeting effects of these two types of synapses can lead to chimera states in\nthe upper layer of uncoupled neurons. Remarkably, we find a density-dependent\nthreshold for the emergence of chimera states in uncoupled neurons, similar to\nthe quorum sensing transition to a synchronized state. Finally, we examine the\nimpact of both homogeneous and heterogeneous inter-layer information\ntransmission delays on the observed chimera states over a wide parameter space.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05834v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

Current microelectrode technologies for recording\nelectrical activity, however, evidence important shortcomings, e.g. challenging\nhigh density integration. Solution-gated field-effect transistors (SGFETs), on\nthe other hand, could overcome these shortcomings if a suitable transistor\nmaterial were available. Graphene is particularly attractive due to its\nbiocompatibility, chemical stability, flexibility, low intrinsic electronic\nnoise and high charge carrier mobilities. Here, we report on the use of an\narray of flexible graphene SGFETs for recording spontaneous slow waves, as well\nas visually evoked and also pre-epileptic activity in vivo in rats. The\nflexible array of graphene SGFETs allows mapping brain electrical activity with\nexcellent signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), suggesting that this technology could\nlay the foundation for a future generation of in vivo recording implants.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05693v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

Synapses are themselves highly complex and diverse\nsignaling machines, containing protein products of hundreds of different genes,\nsome in hundreds of copies, arranged in precise lattice at each individual\nsynapse. Synapses are fundamental not only to synaptic network function but\nalso to network development, adaptation, and memory. In addition, abnormalities\nof synapse numbers or molecular components are implicated in most mental and\nneurological disorders. Despite their obvious importance, mammalian synapse\npopulations have so far resisted detailed quantitative study. In human brains\nand most animal nervous systems, synapses are very small and very densely\npacked: there are approximately 1 billion synapses per cubic millimeter of\nhuman cortex. This volumetric density poses very substantial challenges to\nproteometric analysis at the critical level of the individual synapse.

Uteshev', 'Mario di Bernardo'], u'2016-11-16', u'Extensive experiments in Human Movement Science suggest that solo motions are\ncharacterized by unique features that define the individuality or motor\nsignature of people. While interacting with others, humans tend to\nspontaneously coordinate their movement and unconsciously give rise to joint\nimprovisation. However, it has yet to be shed light on the relationship between\nindividuality and joint improvisation. By means of an ad-hoc virtual agent, in\nthis work we uncover the internal mechanisms of the transition from solo to\njoint improvised motion in the mirror game, a simple yet effective paradigm for\nstudying interpersonal human coordination. According to the analysis of\nexperimental data, normalized segments of velocity in solo motion are regarded\nas individual motor signature, and the existence of velocity segments\npossessing a prescribed signature is theoretically guaranteed. In this work, we\nfirst develop a systematic approach based on velocity segments to generate\n\\emph{in-silico} trajectories of a given human participant playing solo. Then\nwe present an online algorithm for the virtual player to produce joint\nimprovised motion with another agent while exhibiting some desired kinematic\ncharacteristics, and to account for movement coordination and mutual adaptation\nduring joint action tasks. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed approach\nsucceeds in revealing the kinematic features transition from solo to joint\nimprovised motions, thus revealing the existence of a tight relationship\nbetween individuality and joint improvisation.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05443v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Biodiversity in models of cyclic dominance is preserved by heterogeneity\n  in site-specific invasion rates', ['Attila Szolnoki', 'Matjaz Perc'], u'2016-11-17', u'Global, population-wide oscillations in models of cyclic dominance may result\nin the collapse of biodiversity due to the accidental extinction of one species\nin the loop. Previous research has shown that such oscillations can emerge if\nthe interaction network has small-world properties, and more generally, because\nof long-range interactions among individuals or because of mobility. But\nalthough these features are all common in nature, global oscillations are\nrarely observed in actual biological systems. This begets the question what is\nthe missing ingredient that would prevent local oscillations to synchronize\nacross the population to form global oscillations. Here we show that, although\nheterogeneous species-specific invasion rates fail to have a noticeable impact\non species coexistence, randomness in site-specific invasion rates successfully\nhinders the emergence of global oscillations and thus preserves biodiversity.\nOur model takes into account that the environment is often not uniform but\nrather spatially heterogeneous, which may influence the success of microscopic\ndynamics locally. This prevents the synchronization of locally emerging\noscillations, and ultimately results in a phenomenon where one type of\nrandomness is used to mitigate the adverse effects of other types of randomness\nin the system.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05854v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

While dyslexia is not an oculomotor\ndisease, readers with dyslexia have shown different eye movements than\ntypically developing students during text reading. Readers with dyslexia\nexhibit longer and more frequent fixations, shorter saccade lengths, more\nbackward refixations than typical readers. Furthermore, readers with dyslexia\nare known to have difficulty in reading long words, lower skipping rate of\nshort words, and high gaze duration on many words. It is an open question\nwhether it is possible to harness these distinctive oculomotor scanning\npatterns observed during reading in order to develop a screening tool that can\nreliably identify struggling readers, who may be candidates for dyslexia. Here,\nwe introduce a novel, fast, objective, non-invasive method, named Rapid\nAssessment of Difficulties and Abnormalities in Reading (RADAR) that screens\nfor features associated with the aberrant visual scanning of reading text seen\nin dyslexia. Eye tracking parameter measurements that are stable under retest\nand have high discriminative power, as indicated by their ROC curves, were\nobtained during silent text reading. These parameters were combined to derive a\ntotal reading score (TRS) that can reliably separate readers with dyslexia from\ntypical readers.

[u'Balancing specificity, sensitivity and speed of ligand discrimination by\n  zero-order ultraspecificity', ['Masashi K. Kajita', 'Kazuyuki Aihara', 'Tetsuya J. Kobayashi'], u'2016-11-17', u'Specific interactions between receptors and their target ligands in the\npresence of non-target ligands are crucial for biological processes such as T\ncell ligand discrimination. To discriminate between the target and non-target\nligands, cells have to increase specificity by amplifying the small differences\nin affinity among ligands. In addition, sensitivity to ligand concentration and\nquick discrimination are also important to detect low amounts of target ligands\nand facilitate fast cellular decision making after ligand recognition. In this\nwork, we find that ultraspecificity is naturally derived from a well-known\nmechanism for zero-order ultrasensitivity to concentration. We also show that\nthis mechanism can produce an optimal balance of specificity, sensitivity, and\nquick discrimination. Furthermore, we show that a model for insensitivity to\nlarge number of non-terget ligands can be naturally derived from the\nultraspecificity model.

In other words, the quantity of interest is the number of tandem\nduplication operations of the form $\\seq x = \\seq a \\seq b \\seq c \\to \\seq y =\n\\seq a \\seq b \\seq b \\seq c$, where $\\seq x$ and $\\seq y$ are sequences and\n$\\seq a$, $\\seq b$, and $\\seq c$ are their substrings, needed to generate a\nbinary sequence of length $n$ starting from a square-free sequence from the set\n$\\{0,1,01,10,010,101\\}$. This problem is a restricted case of finding the\nduplication/deduplication distance between two sequences, defined as the\nminimum number of duplication and deduplication operations required to\ntransform one sequence to the other. We consider both exact and approximate\ntandem duplications. For exact duplication, denoting the maximum distance to\nthe root of a sequence of length $n$ by $f(n)$, we prove that $f(n)=\\Theta(n)$.\nFor the case of approximate duplication, where a $\\beta$-fraction of symbols\nmay be duplicated incorrectly, we show that the maximum distance has a sharp\ntransition from linear in $n$ to logarithmic at $\\beta=1/2$. We also study the\nduplication distance to the root for sequences with a given root and for\nspecial classes of sequences, namely, the de Bruijn sequences, the Thue-Morse\nsequence, and the Fibbonaci words. The problem is motivated by genomic tandem\nduplication mutations and the smallest number of tandem duplication events\nrequired to generate a given biological sequence.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05537v1', ['Genomics'], []]
