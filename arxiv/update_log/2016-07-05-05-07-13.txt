[u'Cell assemblies at multiple time scales with arbitrary lag distributions', ['Eleonora Russo', 'Daniel Durstewitz'], u'2016-07-04', u"Hebb's idea of a cell assembly as the fundamental unit of neural information\nprocessing has dominated neuroscience like no other theoretical concept within\nthe past 60 years. A range of different physiological phenomena, from precisely\nsynchronized spiking to broadly simultaneous rate increases, has been subsumed\nunder this term. Yet progress in this area is hampered by the lack of\nstatistical tools that would enable to extract assemblies with arbitrary\nconstellations of time lags, and at multiple temporal scales, partly due to the\nsevere computational burden. Here we present such a unifying methodological and\nconceptual framework which detects assembly structure at many different time\nscales, levels of precision, and with arbitrary internal organization. Applying\nthis methodology to multiple single unit recordings from various cortical\nareas, we find that there is no universal cortical coding scheme, but that\nassembly structure and precision significantly depends on brain area recorded\nand ongoing task demands.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00969v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

[u'Decoding the Encoding of Functional Brain Networks: an fMRI\n  Classification Comparison of Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF),\n  Independent Component Analysis (ICA), and Sparse Coding Algorithms', ['Jianwen Xie', 'Pamela K. Douglas', 'Ying Nian Wu', 'Arthur L. Brody', 'Ariana E. Anderson'], u'2016-07-01', u'Brain networks in fMRI are typically identified using spatial independent\ncomponent analysis (ICA), yet mathematical constraints such as sparse coding\nand positivity both provide alternate biologically-plausible frameworks for\ngenerating brain networks. Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) would\nsuppress negative BOLD signal by enforcing positivity. Spatial sparse coding\nalgorithms ($L1$ Regularized Learning and K-SVD) would impose local\nspecialization and a discouragement of multitasking, where the total observed\nactivity in a single voxel originates from a restricted number of possible\nbrain networks.\n  The assumptions of independence, positivity, and sparsity to encode\ntask-related brain networks are compared; the resulting brain networks for\ndifferent constraints are used as basis functions to encode the observed\nfunctional activity at a given time point. These encodings are decoded using\nmachine learning to compare both the algorithms and their assumptions, using\nthe time series weights to predict whether a subject is viewing a video,\nlistening to an audio cue, or at rest, in 304 fMRI scans from 51 subjects.\n  For classifying cognitive activity, the sparse coding algorithm of $L1$\nRegularized Learning consistently outperformed 4 variations of ICA across\ndifferent numbers of networks and noise levels (p$<$0.001). The NMF algorithms,\nwhich suppressed negative BOLD signal, had the poorest accuracy. Within each\nalgorithm, encodings using sparser spatial networks (containing more\nzero-valued voxels) had higher classification accuracy (p$<$0.001). The success\nof sparse coding algorithms may suggest that algorithms which enforce sparse\ncoding, discourage multitasking, and promote local specialization may capture\nbetter the underlying source processes than those which allow inexhaustible\nlocal processes such as ICA.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00435v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'The Host-Pathogen Game: an evolutionary approach to biological\n  competitions', ['Marco Alberto Javarone'], u'2016-07-04', u'We introduce a model called Host-Pathogen game for studying biological\ncompetitions. Notably, we focus on the invasive dynamics of external agents,\nlike bacteria, within a host organism. The former are mapped to a population of\ndefectors, that aim to spread in the extracellular medium of the latter. In\nturn, the host organism is composed of cells mapped to a population of\ncooperators, that aim to remove pathogens. The cooperative behavior of cells\nallows to support the living functions of the whole organism, since each one\nprovides an unitary amount of energy. When one or more bacteria are spatially\nclose to a cell, the latter may use a fraction of its energy to remove them. On\nthe other hand, when a bacterium survives an attack, it absorbs the received\nenergy, becoming stronger and more resistant to further attacks. In addition,\nsince bacteria play as defectors, they aim only to increase their wealth,\nwithout supporting their own kind. As in many living organisms, the host\ntemperature plays a relevant role in host-pathogen equilibria. In particular,\ncooperators succeed when bacteria are completely removed, while the opposite\noutcome entails the host undergoes a deep invasive process, like a blood\npoisoning. Results of numerical simulations show that the dynamics of the\nproposed model allow to reach a variety of equilibria. Here it is worth noting\nthat, on a quality level, the achieved outcomes describe some real scenarios,\nthat can be observed in living systems. To conclude, we deem that our model\nmight open the way to further developments, based on evolutionary game theory,\nfor studying several complex biological phenomena.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00998v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

Therefore, evolutionary dynamics almost always yields the same\nvalue for fitness of the quasi-species, independent of the mutational process\nand initial conditions, and is quite robust to mutational changes and\nfluctuations in initial conditions. Our results naturally extend to any\nLipschitz function whose input parameters are the frequencies of individual\nconstituents of the quasi-species. This suggests that the functional\ncapabilities of high dimensional quasi-species are robust to fluctuations in\nthe mutational probabilities and initial conditions.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00483v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

Common\ncharacteristic patterns, such as pulse rate changes, offs and chirps, are often\nassociated with important behavioral contexts, including aggression, hiding,\nand mating. However these behaviors are only observed when at least two fish\nare freely interacting. Although their electrical pulses can be easily recorded\nby non-invasive techniques, discriminating the emitter of each pulse is\nchallenging when physically similar fish are allowed to freely move and\ninteract. Here we describe the statistical changes of some communication\npatterns during a dominance contest of freely moving \\textit{Gymnotus carapo}\ndyads. Quantitative analysis was possible by using home-made software for\nautomated pulse discrimination and chirp detection. In all freely interacting\ndyads chirps were signatures of subsequent submission, even when they occurred\nearly in the contest. However, offs were not exclusive of the submissive fish,\nbut more frequent and longer on those. Both results are in agreement to\npreviously reported manual analysis, validating our automated analysis. We show\nthat the submissive fish slows down its average pulse rate while the dominant\nkeeps it almost unchanged during and after the dominance is established, in all\nexperiments performed. Additionally, we analyzed if the direct interference of\nelectric organs could cause offs and chirps.
