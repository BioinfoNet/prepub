[u'Experiment-friendly kinetic analysis of single molecule data in and out\n  of equilibrium', ['Sonja Schmid', 'Markus Gotz', 'Thorsten Hugel'], u'2016-05-27', u'We present a simple and robust technique to extract kinetic rate models and\nthermodynamic quantities from single molecule time traces. SMACKS (Single\nMolecule Analysis of Complex Kinetic Sequences) is a maximum likelihood\napproach that works equally well for long trajectories as for a set of short\nones. It resolves all statistically relevant rates and also their\nuncertainties. This is achieved by optimizing one global kinetic model based on\nthe complete dataset, while allowing for experimental variations between\nindividual trajectories. In particular, neither a priori models nor equilibrium\nhave to be assumed. The power of SMACKS is demonstrated on the kinetics of the\nmulti-domain protein Hsp90 measured by smFRET (single molecule F\\"orster\nresonance energy transfer). Experiments in and out of equilibrium are analyzed\nand compared to simulations, shedding new light on the role of Hsp90\'s ATPase\nfunction. SMACKS pushes the boundaries of single molecule kinetics far beyond\ncurrent methods.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08612v1', ['Biomolecules', 'Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Linear dynamical neural population models through nonlinear embeddings', ['Yuanjun Gao', 'Evan Archer', 'Liam Paninski', 'John P. Cunningham'], u'2016-05-26', u'A body of recent work in modeling neural activity focuses on recovering\nlow-dimensional latent features that capture the statistical structure of\nlarge-scale neural populations. Most such approaches have focused on linear\ngenerative models, where inference is computationally tractable. Here, we\npropose fLDS, a general class of nonlinear generative models that permits the\nfiring rate of each neuron to vary as an arbitrary smooth function of a latent,\nlinear dynamical state. This extra flexibility allows the model to capture a\nricher set of neural variability than a purely linear model, but retains an\neasily visualizable low-dimensional latent space. To fit this class of\nnon-conjugate models we propose a variational inference scheme, along with a\nnovel approximate posterior capable of capturing rich temporal correlations\nacross time. We show that our techniques permit inference in a wide class of\ngenerative models.We also show in application to two neural datasets that,\ncompared to state-of-the-art neural population models, fLDS captures a much\nlarger proportion of neural variability with a small number of latent\ndimensions, providing superior predictive performance and interpretability.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08454v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

Lawson', 'Shweta Bansal'], u'2016-05-27', u'Spatial big data have the "velocity," "volume," and "variety" of big data\nsources and additional geographic information about the record. Digital data\nsources, such as medical claims, mobile phone call data records, and geo-tagged\ntweets, have entered infectious disease epidemiology as novel sources of data\nto complement traditional infectious disease surveillance. In this work, we\nprovide examples of how spatial big data have been used thus far in\nepidemiological analyses and describe opportunities for these sources to\nimprove public health coordination and disease mitigation strategies. In\naddition, we consider the technical, practical, and ethical challenges with the\nuse of spatial big data in infectious disease surveillance and inference.\nFinally, we discuss the implications of the rising use of spatial big data in\nepidemiology to health risk communications, across-scale public health\ncoordination, and public health policy recommendation.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08740v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'An Outbreak Vector-host Epidemic Model with Spatial Structure: The 2015\n  Zika Outbreak in Rio de Janeiro', ['W. Fitzgibbon', 'J. Morgan', 'G. Webb'], u'2016-05-27', u'A deterministic model is developed for the spatial spread of an epidemic\ndisease in a geographical setting. The model is focused on an epidemic outbreak\nthat initiates from a small number of cases in a small sub-region of the\ngeographical setting. The partial differential equations of the model are\nanalyzed and proven to be well-posed. The model is illustrated with numerical\nsimulations that reveal epidemic outcomes correlated to the spatially dependent\nparameters of the model and the spatially dependent epidemic basic reproduction\nnumber. The model is applied to the 2015 Zika outbreak in the Rio de Janeiro\nMunicipality.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08726v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Predicting patterns of long-term adaptation and extinction with\n  population genetics', ['Jason Bertram', 'Kevin Gomez', 'Joanna Masel'], u'2016-05-27', u"Population genetics struggles to model extinction; standard models track the\nrelative rather than absolute fitness of genotypes, while the exceptions\ndescribe only the short-term transition from imminent doom to evolutionary\nrescue. But extinction can result from failure to adapt not only to\ncatastrophes, but also to a backlog of environmental challenges. We model\nlong-term evolution to long series of small challenges, where fitter\npopulations reach higher population sizes. The population's long-term fitness\ndynamic is well approximated by a simple stochastic Markov chain model.\nLong-term persistence occurs when the rate of adaptation exceeds the rate of\nenvironmental deterioration for some genotypes. Long-term persistence times are\nconsistent with typical fossil species persistence times of several million\nyears. Immediately preceding extinction, fitness declines rapidly, appearing as\nthough a catastrophe disrupted a stably established population, even though\ngradual evolutionary processes are responsible. New populations go through an\nestablishment phase where, despite being demographically viable, their\nextinction risk is elevated. Should the population survive long enough,\nextinction risk later becomes constant over time.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08717v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Emergence of Persistent Infection due to Heterogeneity', ['Vidit Agrawal', 'Promit Moitra', 'Sudeshna Sinha'], u'2016-05-27', u'We explore the emergence of persistent infection in a patch of population,\nwhere the disease progression of the individuals is given by the SIRS model and\nan individual becomes infected on contact with another infected individual. We\ninvestigate the persistence of contagion qualitatively and quantitatively,\nunder varying degrees of heterogeneity in the initial population. We observe\nthat when the initial population is uniform, consisting of individuals at the\nsame stage of disease progression, infection arising from a contagious seed\ndoes not persist. However when the initial population consists of randomly\ndistributed refractory and susceptible individuals, a single source of\ninfection can lead to sustained infection in the population, as heterogeneity\nfacilitates the de-synchronization of the phases in the disease cycle of the\nindividuals. We also show how the average size of the window of persistence of\ninfection depends on the degree of heterogeneity in the initial composition of\nthe population. In particular, we show that the infection eventually dies out\nwhen the entire initial population is susceptible, while even a few\nsusceptibles among an heterogeneous refractory population gives rise to a large\npersistent infected set.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08575v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Promotion of Cooperation by Selective Group Extinction', ['Marvin A. Bottcher', 'Jan Nagler'], u'2016-05-27', u'Multilevel selection is an important organizing principle that crucially\nunderlies evolutionary processes from the emergence of cells to eusociality and\nthe economics of nations. Previous studies on multilevel selection assumed that\nthe effective higher-level selection emerges from lower-level reproduction.\nThis leads to selection among groups, although only individuals reproduce. We\nintroduce selective group extinction, where groups die with a probability\ninversely proportional to their group fitness. When accounting for this the\ncritical benefit-to-cost ratio is substantially lowered. Because in game theory\nand evolutionary dynamics the degree of cooperation crucially depends on this\nratio above which cooperation emerges previous studies may have substantially\nunderestimated the establishment and maintenance of cooperation.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08553v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Dynamics of transcription-translation networks', ['D. Hudson', 'R. Edwards'], u'2016-05-26', u'A theory for qualitative models of gene regulatory networks has been\ndeveloped over several decades, generally considering transcription factors to\nregulate directly the expression of other transcription factors, without any\nintermediate variables. Here we explore a class of models that explicitly\nincludes both transcription and translation, keeping track of both mRNA and\nprotein concentrations. We mainly deal with transcription regulation functions\nthat are steep sigmoids or step functions, as is often done in protein-only\nmodels, though translation is governed by a linear term. We extend many aspects\nof the protein-only theory to this new context, including properties of fixed\npoints, description of trajectories by mappings between switching points,\nqualitative analysis via a state-transition diagram, and a result on periodic\norbits for negative feedback loops. We find that while singular behaviour in\nswitching domains is largely avoided, non-uniqueness of solutions can still\noccur in the step-function limit.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08474v1', ['Genomics'], []]
