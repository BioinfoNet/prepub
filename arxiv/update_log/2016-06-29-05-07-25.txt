[u'How Stokes Shift Relaxation Reports on Poincar\xe9 Recurrences in Host\n  Dynamics', ['Alexey K. Mazur'], u'2016-06-28', u"Recently it has been revealed that the equilibrium hydrogen-bond breathing\ndynamics of terminal base pairs in short DNA exhibit a power-law relaxation\nsimilar to that in the time-resolved Stokes shift experiments with an\nintercalated coumarin probe. Here a simple theory is proposed that relates the\nStokes shift signal to the statistics of Poincar\\'e recurrences in the\nbase-pair breathing. This theory can explain the origin of the observed slow\nnon-exponential relaxation in time-resolved Stokes shift data for DNA as well\nas other complex systems. It turns out that an intercalated coumarin greatly\nincreases the breathing fluctuations in the neighboring base pairs. This motion\nis qualitatively similar to that in terminal residues, with the same exponent\nin the power-law relaxation decay. The breathing dynamics is transmitted to the\nphotoprobe by direct contacts between aromatic $\\pi$ orbitals of stacked bases.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08629v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Momentum: a new approach to causality in functional Magnetic Resonance\n  Imaging', ['Natalia Bielczyk', 'Alberto Llera', 'Jan Buitelaar', 'Jeffrey Glennon', 'Christian Beckmann'], u'2016-06-28', u'fMRI datasets have always been an enfant terrible to the causal research.\nThis is for a few independent reasons. Firstly, human haemodynamics is delayed\nwith respect to the neuronal activity and acts like a lowpass filter to the\nunderlying neuronal dynamics. Secondly, background activity in neuronal\nnetworks is a confound to causal research. Thirdly, signal to noise ratio is\nlow in fMRI in general, and varies between brain regions. In this work, we\naddress all these. We propose Momentum: a nonparammetric, cost-efficient method\nfor finding causal connections from fMRI data by utilizing all moments of the\nBOLD distributions and combining them into cumulants. Momentum is a classifier\ninformed by Dynamic Causal Modeling used as a forward model for BOLD fMRI.\n  First, we evaluated performance of Momentum on synthetic benchmark, low-noise\ndatasets. Then we moved towards DCM forward simulations that better represent\nnatural confounds in the fMRI datasets such as varying haemodynamic lags,\nsignal magnitudes and noise variances between the upstream and downstream\nregions. Momentum clearly outperforms all the existing methods on the benchmark\ndatasets, but is also far more resilient to all these confounds. This suggests\nthat Momentum might be further validated on the human fMRI datasets.\n  Furthermore, we suggest that, as a methodology for causal inference, Momentum\ncan be used across multiple disciplines beyond fMRI research, and beyond\nneuroscience. This inference procedure can be adapted for every research\nproblem for which a forward model faithfully representing the data can be\nformulated.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08724v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'On the mathematical consequences of binning spike trains', ['B. Cessac', 'A. Le Ny', 'E. Loecherbach'], u'2016-06-28', u'We initiate a mathematical analysis of hidden effects induced by binning\nspike trains of neurons. Assuming that the original spike train has been\ngenerated by a discrete Markov process, we show that binning generates a\nstochastic process which is not Markov any more, but is instead a Variable\nLength Markov Chain (VLMC) with unbounded memory. We also show that the law of\nthe binned raster is a Gibbs measure in the DLR (Dobrushin-Lanford-Ruelle)\nsense coined in mathematical statistical mechanics. This allows the derivation\nof several important consequences on statistical properties of binned spike\ntrains. In particular, we introduce the DLR framework as a natural setting to\nmathematically formalize anticipation, i.e. to tell "how good" our nervous\nsystem is at making predictions. In a probabilistic sense, this corresponds to\ncondition a process by its future and we discuss how binning may affect our\nconclusions on this ability. We finally comment what could be the consequences\nof binning in the detection of spurious phase transitions or in the detection\nof wrong evidences of criticality.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08567v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Oscillations in epidemic models with spread of awareness', ['Winfried Just', 'Joan Saldana'], u'2016-06-28', u'We study ODE models of epidemic spreading with a preventive behavioral\nresponse that is triggered by awareness of the infection. Previous studies of\nsuch models have mostly focused on the impact of the response on the initial\ngrowth of an outbreak and the existence and location of endemic equilibria.\nHere we study the question whether this type of response is sufficient to\nprevent future flare-ups from low endemic levels if awareness is assumed to\ndecay over time. In the ODE context, such flare-ups would translate into\nsustained oscillations with significant amplitudes.\n  Our results show that such oscillations are ruled out in\nSusceptible-Aware-Infectious-Susceptible models with a single compartment of\naware hosts, but can occur if we consider two distinct compartments of aware\nhosts who differ in their willingness to alert other susceptible hosts.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08788v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Optimal Control of a Tuberculosis Model with State and Control Delays', ['Cristiana J. Silva', 'Helmut Maurer', 'Delfim F. M. Torres'], u'2016-06-28', u"We introduce delays in a tuberculosis (TB) model, representing the time delay\non the diagnosis and commencement of treatment of individuals with active TB\ninfection. The stability of the disease free and endemic equilibriums is\ninvestigated for any time delay. Corresponding optimal control problems, with\ntime delays in both state and control variables, are formulated and studied.\nAlthough it is well-known that there is a delay between two to eight weeks\nbetween TB infection and reaction of body's immune system to tuberculin, delays\nfor the active infected to be detected and treated, and delays on the treatment\nof persistent latent individuals due to clinical and patient reasons, which\nclearly justifies the introduction of time delays on state and control\nmeasures, our work seems to be the first to consider such time-delays for TB\nand apply time-delay optimal control to carry out the optimality analysis.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08721v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Stability of Spreading Processes with General Transmission and Recovery\n  Times', ['Masaki Ogura', 'Victor M. Preciado'], u'2016-06-28', u'Although viral spreading processes taking place in networks are commonly\nanalyzed using Markovian models in which both the transmission times and the\nrecovery times follow exponential distributions, empirical studies show that,\nin most real scenarios, the distribution of these times are far from\nexponential. To overcome this limitation, we first introduce a generalized\nspreading model that allows for transmission and recovery times to follow\narbitrary distributions within an arbitrary accuracy. In this context, we\nderive conditions for the generalized spreading process to converge towards the\ndisease-free equilibrium (in other words, to eradicate the viral spread)\nwithout relying on mean-field approximations. Based on our results, we\nillustrate how the particular shape of the transmission/recovery distribution\nheavily influences the boundary of the stability region of the spread, as well\nas the decay rate inside this region. Therefore, modeling non-exponential\ntransmission/recovery times observed in realistic spreading processes via\nexponential distributions can induce significant errors in the stability\nanalysis of the dynamics.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08518v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Law of localization in chemical reaction networks', ['Takashi Okada', 'Atsushi Mochizuki'], u'2016-06-28', u'In living cells, chemical reactions are connected by sharing their products\nand substrates, and form complex networks, e.g. metabolic pathways. Here we\ndeveloped a theory to predict the sensitivity, i.e. the responses of\nconcentrations and fluxes to perturbations of enzymes, from network structure\nalone. Responses turn out to exhibit two characteristic patterns,\n$localization$ and $hierarchy$. We present a general theorem connecting\nsensitivity with network topology that explains these characteristic patterns.\nOur results imply that network topology is an origin of biological robustness.\nFinally, we suggest a strategy to determine real networks from experimental\nmeasurements.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08607v1', ['Molecular Networks', 'Subcellular Processes'], []]
[u'Stochastic Models of Vesicular Sorting in Cellular Organelles', ['Quentin Vagne', 'Pierre Sens'], u'2016-06-28', u'The proper sorting of membrane components by regulated exchange between\ncellular organelles is crucial to intra-cellular organization. This process\nrelies on the budding and fusion of transport vesicles, and should be strongly\ninfluenced by stochastic fluctuations considering the relatively small size of\nmany organelles. We identify the perfect sorting of two membrane components\ninitially mixed in a single compartment as a first passage process, and we show\nthat the mean sorting time exhibits two distinct regimes as a function of the\nratio of vesicle fusion to budding rates. Low ratio values leads to fast\nsorting, but results in a broad size distribution of sorted compartments\ndominated by small entities. High ratio values result in two well defined\nsorted compartments but is exponentially slow. Our results suggests an optimal\nbalance between vesicle budding and fusion for the rapid and efficient sorting\nof membrane components, and highlight the importance of stochastic effects for\nthe steady-state organization of intra-cellular compartments.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08757v1', ['Subcellular Processes'], []]
[u'Using Sequence Ensembles for Seeding Alignments of MinION Sequencing\n  Data', ['Rastislav Rabatin', 'Brona Brejova', 'Tomas Vinar'], u'2016-06-28', u'Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencer is currently the smallest sequencing device\navailable. While being able to produce very long reads (reads of up to 100~kbp\nwere reported), it is prone to high sequencing error rates of up to 30%. Since\nmost of these errors are insertions or deletions, it is very difficult to adapt\npopular seed-based algorithms designed for aligning data sets with much lower\nerror rates.\n  Base calling of MinION reads is typically done using hidden Markov models. In\nthis paper, we propose to represent each sequencing read by an ensemble of\nsequences sampled from such a probabilistic model. This approach can improve\nthe sensitivity and false positive rate of seeding an alignment compared to\nusing a single representative base call sequence for each read.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08719v1', ['Genomics'], []]
[u'Reanalyzing variable directionality of gene expression in\n  transgenerational epigenetic inheritance', ['Abhay Sharma'], u'2016-06-28', u'A previous report claimed no evidence of transgenerational epigenetic\ninheritance in a mouse model of in utero environmental exposure, based on the\nobservation that gene expression changes observed in the germ cells of G1 and\nG2 male fetus were not in the same direction. A subsequent data reanalysis\nhowever showed a statistically significant overlap between G1 and G2 genes\nirrespective of direction, leading to the suggestion that, as phenotypic\nvariability in epigenetic transmission has been observed in several other\nexamples also, the above report provided evidence in favor of, not against,\ntransgenerational inheritance. This criticism has recently been questioned.\nHere, it is shown that the questions raised are based not only on incorrect\nstatistical calculations but also on wrong premise that gene expression changes\ndo not constitute a phenotype.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08585v1', ['Genomics'], []]
