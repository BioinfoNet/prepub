[u'Stochastic switching between multistable oscillation patterns of the\n  Min-system', ['Artemij Amiranashvili', 'Nikolas D Schnellbacher', 'Ulrich S Schwarz'], u'2016-10-17', u'The spatiotemporal oscillation patterns of the proteins MinD and MinE are\nused by the bacterium E. coli to sense its own geometry. Strikingly, both\ncomputer simulations and experiments have recently shown that for the same\ngeometry of the reaction volume, different oscillation patterns can be stable,\nwith stochastic switching between them. Here we use particle-based Brownian\ndynamics simulations to predict the relative frequency of different oscillation\npatterns over a large range of three-dimensional compartment geometries, in\nexcellent agreement with experimental results. Fourier analyses as well as\npattern recognition algorithms are used to automatically identify the different\noscillation patterns and the switching rates between them. We also identify\nnovel oscillation patterns in three-dimensional compartments with\nmembrane-covered walls and identify a linear relation between the bound\nMin-protein densities and the volume-to-surface ratio. In general, our work\nshows how geometry sensing is limited by multistability and stochastic\nfluctuations.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05235v1', ['Biomolecules', 'Subcellular Processes'], [u'Heidelberg University']]
[u'ProQ3D: Improved model quality assessments using Deep Learning', ['Karolis Uziela', 'David Menendez Hurtado', 'Bjorn Wallner', 'Arne Elofsson'], u'2016-10-17', u'Summary: Protein quality assessment is a long-standing problem in\nbioinformatics. For more than a decade we have developed state-of-art\npredictors by carefully selecting and optimising inputs to a machine learning\nmethod. The correlation has increased from 0.60 in ProQ to 0.81 in ProQ2 and\n0.85 in ProQ3 mainly by adding a large set of carefully tuned descriptions of a\nprotein. Here, we show that a substantial improvement can be obtained using\nexactly the same inputs as in ProQ2 or ProQ3 but replacing the support vector\nmachine by a deep neural network. This improves the Pearson correlation to 0.90\n(0.85 using ProQ2 input features).\n  Availability: ProQ3D is freely available both as a webserver and a\nstand-alone program at http://proq3.bioinfo.se/', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05189v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Exact results for power spectrum and susceptibility of a leaky\n  integrate-and-fire neuron with two-state noise', ['Felix Droste', 'Benjamin Lindner'], u'2016-10-17', u'The response properties of excitable systems driven by colored noise are of\ngreat interest, but are usually mathematically only accessible via\napproximations. For this reason, dichotomous noise, a rare example of a colored\nnoise leading often to analytically tractable problems, has been extensively\nused in the study of stochastic systems. Here, we calculate exact expressions\nfor the power spectrum and the susceptibility of a leaky integrate-and-fire\nneuron driven by asymmetric dichotomous noise. While our results are in\nexcellent agreement with simulations, they also highlight a limitation of using\ndichotomous noise as a simple model for more complex fluctuations: Both power\nspectrum and susceptibility exhibit an undamped periodic structure, the origin\nof which we discuss in detail.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05084v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'A Rich Source of Labels for Deep Network Models of the Primate Dorsal\n  Visual Stream', ['Omid Rezai', 'Pinar Boyraz Jentsch', 'Bryan Tripp'], u'2016-10-17', u'Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have structures that are loosely\nrelated to that of the primate visual cortex. Surprisingly, when these networks\nare trained for object classification, the activity of their early,\nintermediate, and later layers becomes closely related to activity patterns in\ncorresponding parts of the primate ventral visual stream. The activity\nstatistics are far from identical, but perhaps remaining differences can be\nminimized in order to produce artificial networks with highly brain-like\nactivity and performance, which would provide a rich source of insight into\nprimate vision. One way to align CNN activity more closely with neural activity\nis to add cost functions that directly drive deep layers to approximate neural\nrecordings. However, suitably large datasets are particularly difficult to\nobtain for deep structures, such as the primate middle temporal area (MT). To\nwork around this barrier, we have developed a rich empirical model of activity\nin MT. The model is pixel-computable, so it can provide an arbitrarily large\n(but approximate) set of labels to better guide learning in the corresponding\nlayers of deep networks. Our model approximates a number of MT phenomena more\nclosely than previous models. Furthermore, our model approximates population\nstatistics in detail through fourteen parameter distributions that we estimated\nfrom the electrophysiology literature. In general, deep networks with internal\nrepresentations that closely approximate those of the brain may help to clarify\nthe mechanisms that produce these representations, and the roles of various\nproperties of these representations in performance of vision tasks. Although\nour empirical model inevitably differs from real neural activity, it allows\ntuning properties to be modulated independently, which may allow very detailed\nexploration of the origins and functional roles of these properties.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04962v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Complete coverage of space favors modularity of the grid system in the\n  brain', ['Alessandro Sanzeni', 'Vijay Balasubramanian', 'Guido Tiana', 'Massimo Vergassola'], u'2016-10-16', u'Grid cells in the entorhinal cortex fire when animals that are exploring a\ncertain region of space occupy the vertices of a triangular grid that spans the\nenvironment. Different neurons feature triangular grids that differ in their\nproperties of periodicity, orientation and ellipticity. Taken together, these\ngrids allow the animal to maintain an internal, mental representation of\nphysical space. Experiments show that grid cells are modular, i.e. there are\ngroups of neurons which have grids with similar periodicity, orientation and\nellipticity. We use statistical physics methods to derive a relation between\nvariability of the properties of the grids within a module and the range of\nspace that can be covered completely (i.e. without gaps) by the grid system\nwith high probability. Larger variability shrinks the range of representation,\nproviding a functional rationale for the experimentally observed co-modularity\nof grid cell periodicity, orientation and ellipticity. We obtain a scaling\nrelation between the number of neurons and the period of a module, given the\nvariability and coverage range. Specifically, we predict how many more neurons\nare required at smaller grid scales than at larger ones.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04844v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

Van\nValen predicted that, because of zero-sum dynamics, all populations of all\nspecies in a given environment flux the same amount of energy on average.\nDamuth's 'energetic equivalence rule' supported Van Valen's conjecture by\nshowing a trade off between few big animals per area with high individual\nmetabolic rates compared to abundant small species with low energy\nrequirements. We use established metabolic scaling theory to compare variation\nin densities and individual energy use in human societies to other land\nmammals. We show that hunter-gatherers occurred at lower densities than a\nmammal of our size. Most modern humans, in contrast, concentrate in large\ncities at densities that are up to four orders of magnitude greater than\nhunter-gatherers yet cities consume up to two orders of magnitude greater\nenergy per capita. Today, cities across the globe flux greater energy than net\nprimary productivity on a per area basis. This is possible through enormous\nfluxes of energy and materials across urban boundaries to sustain hyper-dense,\nmodern humans.

[u'Population dynamics in an intermittent refuge', ['E. H. Colombo', 'C.

We consider a standard model\nfor the evolution of a single species population density, that includes\nreproduction, competition for resources and spatial spreading, while subject to\nan external harmful effect. The habitat is spatially heterogeneous, there\nexisting a refuge where the population can be protected. Temporal variability\nis introduced by the intermittent character of the refuge. This scenario can\napply to a wide range of situations, from a lab setting where bacteria can be\nprotected by a blinking mask from ultraviolet radiation, to large scale\necosystems, like a marine reserve where there can be seasonal fishing\nprohibitions. Using analytical and numerical tools, we investigate the\nasymptotic behavior of the total population as a function of the size and\ncharacteristic time scales of the refuge. We obtain expressions for the minimal\nsize required for population survival, in the slow and fast time scale limits.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05066v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Full Reconstruction of Non-Stationary Strand-Symmetric Models on Rooted\n  Phylogenies', ['Benjamin D Kaehler'], u'2016-10-17', u'Understanding the evolutionary relationship between species is of fundamental\nimportance to the biological sciences. The location of the root in any\nphylogenetic tree is critical as it gives an order to evolutionary events. None\nof the popular models of nucleotide evolution used in likelihood or Bayesian\nmethods are able to infer the location of the root without exogenous\ninformation. It is known that the most general Markov models of nucleotide\nsubstitution can also not identify the location of the root nor be fitted to\nmultiple sequence alignments with less than three sequences. We prove that the\nlocation of the root and the full model can be identified and statistically\nconsistently estimated for a non-stationary, strand-symmetric substitution\nmodel given a multiple sequence alignment with two or more sequences.

[u'The Health Status of a Population: Health State and Survival Curves, and\n  HALE Estimates', ['Christos H Skiadas', 'Charilaos Skiadas'], u'2016-10-17', u'In this paper we explore the very important case of finding a health measure\nin the lines of the survival curve but independent of the standard deviation\nparameter. This is done by estimating the health state curve and calculating\nthe total area under the curve. An interesting comparison with the survival\ncurves is done. The health status measure (HSM or HS) resulting is of the form\nof the life expectancy (LE) as it is expressed in terms of years of age. The HS\nis independent of the standard deviation. When a perfect rectangularization of\nthe survival curve appear, the LE is equal to the age where the health state\ncurve approaches zero. The provided HS form gives rise to an interesting\nclassification of various countries. The results are close to those obtained by\nthe LE estimator with an interesting reorganization of country ranking. We also\nprovide illustrations of our estimated Health Status along with comparative\npresentations of the Healthy Life Expectancy and the HALE measures in several\ncountries.

[u'Three-dimensional contact of TITH cartilage layers, a closed-form\n  solution', ['Gennaro Vitucci', 'Gennady Mishuris'], u'2016-10-15', u'Inhomogeneity and anisotropy play a crucial role in attributing articular\ncartilage its properties. The frictionless contact model constructed here\nconsists in two thin biphasic transversely isotropic transversely homogeneous\n(TITH) cartilage layers firmly attached onto rigid substrates and shaped as\nelliptic paraboloids of different radii. Using asymptotic techniques, a\nsolution to the deformation problem of such material has been recently obtained\nextending previous ones referred to homogeneous materials. The layer itself is\nthin in comparison with the size of the contact area and the observed time is\nshorter than the hydrogel characteristic time. The emerging three-dimensional\ncontact problem is solved in closed-form and numerical benchmarks for constant\nand oscillating loads are given. The results are shown in terms of contact\npressure and approach of the bones. The latter is derived to be directly\nproportional to the contact area. Existing experimental data are reinterpreted\nin view of the current model formulation. Comparisons are made with existing\nsolutions for homogeneous biphasic materials in order to underline the\nfunctional importance of inhomogeneity in spreading the contact pressure\ndistribution across the contact area.

[u'Theory for strength and stability of an unusual "ligand-receptor" bond:\n  a microtubule attached to a wall by molecular motor tethers', ['Dipanwita Ghanti', 'Debashish Chowdhury'], u'2016-10-16', u'A microtubule (MT) is a tubular stiff filament formed by a hierarchical\norganization of tubulin proteins. We develop a stochastic kinetic model for\nstudying the strength and stability of a pre-formed attachment of a MT with a\nrigid wall where the MT is tethered to the wall by a group of motor proteins.\nSuch an attachment, formed by the specific interactions between the MT and the\nmotors, is an analog of ligand-receptor bonds, the MT and the motors anchored\non the wall being the counterparts of the ligand and receptors, respectively.\nHowever, unlike other ligands, the length of a MT can change with time because\nof its polymerization-depolymerization kinetics. The simple model developed\nhere is motivated by the MTs linked to the cell cortex by dynein motors. We\npresent the theory for both force-ramp and force-clamp conditions. In the\nforce-ramp protocol we investigate the strength of the attachment by assuming\nimposition of a time-dependent external load tension that increases linearly\nwith time till the attachment gets ruptured, we calculate the distribution of\nthe rupture forces that fluctuates from one loading to another. In the\nforce-clamp protocol, to test the stability, we compute the distribution of the\nlifetimes of the attachments under externally applied time-independent load\ntension, the results establish the MT-wall attachment to be an analog of a\nslip-bond.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04835v1', ['Subcellular Processes'], []]
