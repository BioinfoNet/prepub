[u'Ultraslow water-mediated transmembrane interactions regulate the\n  activation of A$_{\\text{2A}}$ adenosine receptor', ['Yoonji Lee', 'Songmi Kim', 'Sun Choi', 'Changbong Hyeon'], u'2016-08-04', u'Water molecules inside G-protein coupled receptor have recently been\nspotlighted in a series of crystal structures. To decipher the dynamics and\nfunctional roles of internal waters in GPCR activity, we studied\nA$_{\\text{2A}}$ adenosine receptor using $\\mu$sec-molecular dynamics\nsimulations. Our study finds that the amount of water flux across the\ntransmembrane (TM) domain varies depending on the receptor state, and that the\nwater molecules of the TM channel in the active state flow three times slower\nthan those in the inactive state. Depending on the location in solvent-protein\ninterface as well as the receptor state, the average residence time of water in\neach residue varies from $\\sim\\mathcal{O}(10^2)$ psec to\n$\\sim\\mathcal{O}(10^2)$ nsec. Especially, water molecules, exhibiting ultraslow\nrelaxation ($\\sim\\mathcal{O}(10^2)$ nsec) in the active state, are found around\nthe microswitch residues that are considered activity hotspots for GPCR\nfunction. A continuous allosteric network spanning the TM domain, arising from\nwater-mediated contacts, is unique in the active state, underscoring the\nimportance of slow waters in the GPCR activation.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.01473v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Systems-level approach to uncovering diffusive states and their\n  transitions from single particle trajectories', ['Peter K. Koo', 'Simon G. J. Mochrie'], u'2016-08-04', u"The stochastic motions of a diffusing particle contain information concerning\nthe particle's interactions with binding partners and with its local\nenvironment. However, accurate determination of the underlying diffusive\nproperties, beyond normal diffusion, has remained challenging when analyzing\nparticle trajectories on an individual basis. Here, we introduce the maximum\nlikelihood estimator (MLE) for confined diffusion and fractional Brownian\nmotion. We demonstrate that this MLE yields improved estimation over\ntraditional mean square displacement analyses. We also introduce a model\nselection scheme (that we call mleBIC) that classifies individual trajectories\nto a given diffusion mode. We demonstrate the statistical limitations of\nclassification via mleBIC using simulated data. To overcome these limitations,\nwe introduce a new version of perturbation expectation-maximization (pEMv2),\nwhich simultaneously analyzes a collection of particle trajectories to uncover\nthe system of interactions which give rise to unique normal and/or non-normal\ndiffusive states within the population. We test and evaluate the performance of\npEMv2 on various sets of simulated particle trajectories, which transition\namong several modes of normal and non-normal diffusion, highlighting the key\nconsiderations for employing this analysis methodology.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.01419v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]

Wingreen'], u'2016-08-04', u'Cells actively probe and respond to the stiffness of their surroundings.\nSince mechanosensory cells in connective tissue are surrounded by a disordered\nnetwork of biopolymers, their in vivo mechanical environment can be extremely\nheterogeneous. Here, we investigate how this heterogeneity impacts\nmechanosensing by modeling the cell as an idealized local stiffness sensor\ninside a disordered fiber network. For all types of networks we study,\nincluding experimentally-imaged collagen and fibrin architectures, we find that\nmeasurements applied at different points throughout a given network yield a\nstrikingly broad range of local stiffnesses, spanning roughly two decades. We\nverify via simulations and scaling arguments that this broad range of local\nstiffnesses is a generic property of disordered fiber networks, and show that\nthe range can be further increased by tuning specific network features,\nincluding the presence of long fibers and the proximity to elastic transitions.\nThese features additionally allow for a highly tunable dependence of stiffness\non probe length. Finally, we show that to obtain optimal, reliable estimates of\nglobal tissue stiffness, a cell must adjust its size, shape, and position to\nintegrate multiple stiffness measurements over extended regions of space.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.01620v1', ['Tissues and Organs', 'Cell Behavior'], []]
[u'The Mechanism Behind Beauty: Golden Ratio Appears in Red Blood Cell\n  Shape', ['Xue-Jun Zhang', 'Zhong-Can Ou-Yang'], u'2016-07-25', u'In the past two decades, under the conditions that both the osmotic pressure\n$\\Delta p$ and tensile stress $\\lambda$ equal zero, a rigorous solution (RS) of\nhuman red blood cell (RBC) with a minus spontaneous curvature $c_{0}$ has been\nderived with Helfrich model. And, by fitting with observed shapes of RBC,\n$c_{0}R_{0}$ has been predicted to be -1.62 as minus golden ratio, where\n$R_{0}$ is the radius of a sphere with the same area of RBC.
