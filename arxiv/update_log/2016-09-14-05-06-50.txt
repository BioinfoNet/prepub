[u'Scalable Algorithms for Generating and Analyzing Structural Brain\n  Networks with a Varying Number of Nodes', ['Yu Jin', 'Joseph F. JaJa', 'Rong Chen', 'Edward H. Herskovits'], u'2016-09-13', u"Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) exploits the anisotropic diffusion\nof water molecules in the brain to enable the estimation of the brain's\nanatomical fiber tracts at a relatively high resolution. In particular,\ntractographic methods can be used to generate whole-brain anatomical\nconnectivity matrix where each element provides an estimate of the connectivity\nstrength between the corresponding voxels. Structural brain networks are built\nusing the connectivity information and a predefined brain parcellation, where\nthe nodes of the network represent the brain regions and the edge weights\ncapture the connectivity strengths between the corresponding brain regions.\nThis paper introduces a number of novel scalable methods to generate and\nanalyze structural brain networks with a varying number of nodes. In\nparticular, we introduce a new parallel algorithm to quickly generate large\nscale connectivity-based parcellations for which voxels in a region possess\nhighly similar connectivity patterns to the rest of the regions. We show that\nthe corresponding regional structural consistency is always superior to\nrandomly generated parcellations over a wide range of parcellation sizes.\nCorresponding brain networks with a varying number of nodes are analyzed using\nstandard graph-theorectic measures, as well as, new measures derived from\nspectral graph theory. Our results indicate increasingly more statistical power\nof brain networks with larger numbers of nodes and the relatively unique shape\nof the spectral profile of large brain networks relative to other well-known\nnetworks.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03893v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'A hierarchical neural stimulation model for pain relief by variation of\n  coil design parameters', ['Raunaq Pradhan', 'Yuanjin Zheng'], u'2016-09-13', u'Neural stimulation represents a powerful technique for neural disorder\ntreatment. This paper deals with optimization of coil design parameters to be\nused during stimulation for modulation of neuronal firing to achieve pain\nrelief. Pain mechanism is briefly introduced and a hierarchical stimulation\nmodel from coil stimulation to neuronal firing is proposed. Electromagnetic\nfield distribution for circular, figure of 8 and Magnetic resonance coupling\nfigure of 8 coils are analyzed with respect to the variation of stimulation\nparameters such as distance between coils, stimulation frequency, number of\nturns and radius of coils. MRC figure of 8 coils were responsible for inducing\nthe maximum Electric field for same amount of driving current in coils.\nVariation of membrane potential, ion channel conductance and neuronal firing\nfrequency in a pyramidal neuronal model due to magnetic and acoustic\nstimulation are studied. The frequency of neuronal firing for cortical neurons\nis higher during pain state, compared to no pain state. Lowest neuronal firing\nfrequency 18 Hz was found for MRC figure of 8 coils, compared to 30 Hz for\ncircular coils. Therefore, MRC figure of 8 coils are most effective for\nmodulation of neuronal firing, thereby achieving pain relief in comparison to\nother coils considered in this study', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03730v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'A Computational Analysis of the Function of Three Inhibitory Cell Types\n  in Contextual Visual Processing', ['Jung H. Lee', 'Christof Koch', 'Stefan Mihalas'], u'2016-09-12', u'Most cortical inhibitory cell types exclusively express one of three genes,\nparvalbumin, somatostatin and 5HT3a. The visual responses of cortical neurons\nare affected not only by local cues, but also by visual context. As the\ninhibitory neuron types have distinctive synaptic sources and targets over\ndifferent spatial extents and from different areas, we conjecture that they\npossess distinct roles in contextual processing. We use modeling to relate\nstructural information to function in primary visual cortex (V1) of the mouse,\nand investigate their role in contextual visual processing. Our findings are\nthreefold. First, the inhibition mediated by parvalbumin positive (PV) cells\nmediates local processing and could underlie their role in boundary detection.\nSecond, the inhibition mediated by somatostatin-positive (SST) cells\nfacilitates longer range spatial competition among receptive fields. Third,\nnon-specific top-down modulation to interneurons expressing vasoactive\nintestinal polypeptide (VIP), a subclass of 5HT3a neurons, can selectively\nenhance V1 responses.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03622v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'On open and closed convex codes', ['Joshua Cruz', 'Chad Giusti', 'Vladimir Itskov', 'Bill Kronholm'], u'2016-09-12', u'Combinatorial codes, i.e. subsets of the power set, naturally arise as the\nlanguage of neural networks in the brain and silicon. A number of combinatorial\ncodes in the brain arise as a pattern of intersections of convex sets in a\nEuclidean space. Such codes are called convex. Not every code is convex. What\nmakes a code convex and what determines its embedding dimension is still poorly\nunderstood. Here we establish that the codes that arise from open convex sets\nand the codes that arise from closed convex sets are distinct classes of codes.\nWe prove that open convexity is inherited from a sub-code with the same\nsimplicial complex. Finally we prove that codes that contain all intersections\nof its maximal codewords are both open and closed convex, and provide an upper\nbound for their embedding dimension.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03502v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Bio-Inspired Filter Banks for SSVEP-based Brain-Computer Interfaces', ['A. Fatih Demir', 'Huseyin Arslan', 'Ismail Uysal'], u'2016-09-11', u'Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) have the potential to play a vital role in\nfuture healthcare technologies by providing an alternative way of communication\nand control. More specifically, steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)\nbased BCIs have the advantage of higher accuracy and higher information\ntransfer rate (ITR). In order to fully exploit the capabilities of such\ndevices, it is necessary to understand the features of SSVEP and design the\nsystem considering its biological characteristics. This paper introduces\nbio-inspired filter banks (BIFB) for a novel SSVEP frequency detection method.\nIt is known that SSVEP response to a flickering visual stimulus is frequency\nselective and gets weaker as the frequency of the stimuli increases. In the\nproposed approach, the gain and bandwidth of the filters are designed and tuned\nbased on these characteristics while also incorporating harmonic SSVEP\nresponses. This method not only improves the accuracy but also increases the\navailable number of commands by allowing the use of stimuli frequencies elicit\nweak SSVEP responses. The BIFB method achieved reliable performance when tested\non datasets available online and compared with two well-known SSVEP frequency\ndetection methods, power spectral density analysis (PSDA) and canonical\ncorrelation analysis (CCA). The results show the potential of bio-inspired\ndesign which will be extended to include further SSVEP characteristic (e.g.\ntime-domain waveform) for future SSVEP based BCIs.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03224v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

Dawkins'], u'2016-09-12', u'Animals live in groups to defend against predation and to obtain food.\nHowever, for some animals --- especially ones that spend long periods of time\nfeeding --- there are costs if a group chooses to move on before their\nnutritional needs are satisfied. If the conflict between feeding and keeping up\nwith a group becomes too large, it may be advantageous to some animals to split\ninto subgroups of animals with similar nutritional needs. We model the costs\nand benefits of splitting by a herd of cows using a cost function (CF) that\nquantifies individual variation in hunger, desire to lie down, and predation\nrisk. We model the costs associated with hunger and lying desire as the\nstandard deviations of individuals within a group, and we model predation risk\nas an inverse exponential function of group size. We minimize the cost function\nover all plausible groups that can arise from a given herd and study the\ndynamics of group splitting. We explore our model using two examples: (1) we\nconsider group switching and group fission in a herd of relatively homogeneous\ncows; and (2) we examine a herd with an equal number of adult males (larger\nanimals) and adult females (smaller animals).', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03923v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

[u'Method to Assess the Temporal Persistence of Potential Biometric\n  Features: Application to Oculomotor, and Gait-Related Databases', ['Lee Friedman', 'Ioannis Rigas', 'Mark S. Nixon', 'Oleg V. Komogortsev'], u'2016-09-13', u"Although temporal persistence, or permanence, is a well understood\nrequirement for optimal biometric features, there is no general agreement on\nhow to assess temporal persistence. We suggest that the best way to assess\ntemporal persistence is to perform a test-retest study, and assess test-retest\nreliability. For ratio-scale features that are normally distributed, this is\nbest done using the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC). For 10 distinct\ndata sets (8 eye-movement related, and 2 gait related), we calculated the\ntest-retest reliability ('Temporal persistence') of each feature, and compared\nbiometric performance of high-ICC features to lower ICC features, and to the\nset of all features. We demonstrate that using a subset of only high-ICC\nfeatures produced superior Rank-1-Identification Rate (Rank-1-IR) performance\nin 9 of 10 databases (p = 0.01, one-tailed). For Equal Error Rate (EER), using\na subset of only high-ICC features produced superior performance in 8 of 10\ndatabases (p = 0.055, one-tailed). In general, then, prescreening potential\nbiometric features, and choosing only highly reliable features will yield\nbetter performance than lower ICC features or than the set of all features\ncombined. We hypothesize that this would likely be the case for any biometric\nmodality where the features can be expressed as quantitative values on an\ninterval or ratio scale, assuming an adequate number of relatively independent\nfeatures.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03948v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Efficiency of a Stochastic Search with Punctual and Costly Restarts', ['Kabir Husain', 'Sandeep Krishna'], u'2016-09-13', u'The mean completion time of a stochastic process may be rendered finite and\nminimised by a judiciously chosen restart protocol, which may either be\nstochastic or deterministic. Here we study analytically an arbitrary stochastic\nsearch subject to an arbitrary restart protocol, each characterised by a\ndistribution of waiting times. By a direct enumeration of paths we construct\nthe joint distribution of completion time and restart number, in a form\namenable to analytical evaluation or quadrature; thereby we optimise the search\nover both time and potentially costly restart events. Analysing the effect of a\npunctual, i.e. almost deterministic, restart, we demonstrate that the optimal\ncompletion time always increases proportionately with the variance of the\nrestart distribution; the constant of proportionality depends only on the\nsearch process. We go on to establish simple bounds on the optimal restart\ntime.
