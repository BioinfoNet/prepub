[u'The Role of Cytosine Methylation on Charge Transport through a DNA Strand', ['Jianqing Qi', 'Niranjan Govind', 'M. P. Anantram'], u'2017-02-19', u'Cytosine methylation has been found to play a crucial role in various biological processes, including a number of human diseases. The detection of this small modification remains challenging. In this work, we computationally explore the possibility of detecting methylated DNA strands through direct electrical conductance measurements. Using density functional theory and the Landauer-Buttiker method, we study the electronic properties and charge transport through an eight base-pair methylated DNA strand and its native counterpart. We first analyze the effect of cytosine methylation on the tight-binding parameters of two DNA strands and then model the transmission of the electrons and conductance through the strands both with and without decoherence. We find that the main difference of the tight-binding parameters between the native DNA and the methylated DNA lies in the on-site energies of (methylated) cytosine bases. The intra- and inter- strand hopping integrals between two nearest neighboring guanine base and (methylated) cytosine base also change with the addition of the methyl groups. Our calculations show that in the phase-coherent limit, the transmission of the methylated strand is close to the native strand when the energy is nearby the highest occupied molecular orbital level and larger than the native strand by 5 times in the bandgap. The trend in transmission also holds in the presence of the decoherence with the same rate. The lower conductance for the methylated strand in the experiment is suggested to be caused by the more stable structure due to the introduction of the methyl groups. We also study the role of the exchangecorrelation functional and the effect of contact coupling by choosing coupling strengths ranging from weak to strong coupling limit.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05700v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'An Efficient Method for online Detection of Polychronous Patterns in Spiking Neural Network', ['Joseph Chrol-Cannon', 'Yaochu Jin', 'Andre Gruning'], u'2017-02-20', u'Polychronous neural groups are effective structures for the recognition of precise spike-timing patterns but the detection method is an inefficient multi-stage brute force process that works off-line on pre-recorded simulation data. This work presents a new model of polychronous patterns that can capture precise sequences of spikes directly in the neural simulation. In this scheme, each neuron is assigned a randomized code that is used to tag the post-synaptic neurons whenever a spike is transmitted. This creates a polychronous code that preserves the order of pre-synaptic activity and can be registered in a hash table when the post-synaptic neuron spikes. A polychronous code is a sub-component of a polychronous group that will occur, along with others, when the group is active. We demonstrate the representational and pattern recognition ability of polychronous codes on a direction selective visual task involving moving bars that is typical of a computation performed by simple cells in the cortex. The computational efficiency of the proposed algorithm far exceeds existing polychronous group detection methods and is well suited for online detection.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05939v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Pupil size behavior during on line processing of sentences', ['Gerardo Fernandez', 'Juan Biondi', 'Silvia Castro', 'Osvaldo Agamennoni'], u'2017-02-18', u"In the present work we analyzed the pupil size behavior of forty subjects while they read well defined sentences with different contextual predictability (i.e., regular sentences and proverbs). In general, pupil size increased when reading regular sentences, but when readers realized that they were reading proverbs their pupils strongly increase until finishing proverbs' reading. Our results suggest that an increased pupil size is not limited to cognitive load (i.e., relative difficulty in processing) because when participants accurately recognized words during reading proverbs, theirs pupil size increased too. Our results show that pupil size dynamics may be a reliable measure to investigate the cognitive processes involved in sentence processing and memory functioning.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05620v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'A simple mathematical model inspired by the Purkinje cells: from delayed travelling waves to fractional diffusion', ['Serena Dipierro', 'Enrico Valdinoci'], u'2017-02-18', u'Recently, several experiments have demonstrated the existence of fractional diffusion in the neuronal transmission occurring in the Purkinje cells, whose malfunctioning is known to be related to the lack of voluntary coordination and the appearance of tremors. Also, a classical mathematical feature is that (fractional) parabolic equations possess smoothing effects, in contrast with the case of hyperbolic equations, which typically exhibit shocks and discontinuities. In this paper, we show how a simple toy-model of a highly ramified structure, somehow inspired by that of the Purkinje cells, may produce a fractional diffusion via the superposition of travelling waves that solve a hyperbolic equation. This could suggest that the high ramification of the Purkinje cells might have provided an evolutionary advantage of "smoothing" the transmission of signals and avoiding shock propagations (at the price of slowing a bit such transmission). Though an experimental confirmation of the possibility of such evolutionary advantage goes well beyond the goals of this paper, we think that is intriguing, as a mathematical counterpart, to consider the time fractional diffusion as arising from the superposition of delayed travelling waves in highly ramified transmission media. The new link that we propose between time fractional diffusion and hyperbolic equation also provides a novelty with respect to the usual paradigm relating time fractional diffusion with parabolic equations in the limit. The paper is written in such a way to be usable by both the communities of biologists and mathematicians: to this aim, full explanations of the object considered and detailed lists of references are provided.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05553v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Social learning in a simple task allocation game', ['Rui Chen', 'Garcia Julian', 'Meyer Bernd'], u'2017-02-19', u'We investigate the effects of social interactions in task al- location using Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT). We propose a simple task-allocation game and study how different learning mechanisms can give rise to specialised and non- specialised colonies under different ecological conditions. By combining agent-based simulations and adaptive dynamics we show that social learning can result in colonies of generalists or specialists, depending on ecological parameters. Agent-based simulations further show that learning dynamics play a crucial role in task allocation. In particular, introspective individual learning readily favours the emergence of specialists, while a process resembling task recruitment favours the emergence of generalists.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05739v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Bounds for phylogenetic network space metrics', ['Andrew Francis', 'Katharina Huber', 'Vincent Moulton', 'Taoyang Wu'], u'2017-02-18', u'Phylogenetic networks are a generalization of phylogenetic trees that allow for representation of reticulate evolution. Recently, a space of unrooted phylogenetic networks was introduced, where such a network is a connected graph in which every vertex has degree 1 or 3 and whose leaf-set is a fixed set $X$ of taxa. This space, denoted $\\mathcal{N}(X)$, is defined in terms of two operations on networks -- the nearest neighbor interchange and triangle operations -- which can be used to transform any network with leaf set $X$ into any other network with that leaf set. In particular, it gives rise to a metric $d$ on $\\mathcal N(X)$ which is given by the smallest number of operations required to transform one network in $\\mathcal N(X)$ into another in $\\mathcal N(X)$. The metric generalizes the well-known NNI-metric on phylogenetic trees which has been intensively studied in the literature. In this paper, we derive bounds for the metric $d_{N\\!N\\!I}$ which arises when restricting $d$ to the subset of $\\mathcal{N}(X)$ consisting of all networks with $2(|X|-1+i)$ vertices, $i \\ge 1$. We also introduce two new metrics on networks -- the SPR and TBR metrics -- which generalize the metrics on phylogenetic trees with the same name and give bounds for these new metrics. We expect our results to eventually have applications to the development and understanding of network search algorithms.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05609v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'A physiology--based parametric imaging method for FDG--PET data', ['Mara Scussolini', 'Sara Barbarino', 'Gianmario Sambuceti', 'Giacomo Caviglia', 'Michele Piana'], u'2017-02-20', u'Parametric imaging is a compartmental approach that processes nuclear imaging data to estimate the spatial distribution of the kinetic parameters governing tracer flow. The present paper proposes a novel and efficient computational method for parametric imaging which is potentially applicable to several compartmental models of diverse complexity and which is effective in the determination of the parametric maps of all kinetic coefficients. We consider applications to [{18}F]-fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG--PET) data and analyze the two--compartment catenary model describing the standard FDG metabolization by an homogeneous tissue and the three--compartment non--catenary model representing the renal physiology. We show uniqueness theorems for both models. The proposed imaging method starts from the reconstructed FDG--PET images of tracer concentration and preliminarily applies image processing algorithms for noise reduction and image segmentation. The optimization procedure solves pixelwise the non--linear inverse problem of determining the kinetic parameters from dynamic concentration data through a regularized Gauss--Newton iterative algorithm. The reliability of the method is validated against synthetic data, for the two--compartment system, and experimental real data of murine models, for the renal three--compartment system.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06067v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'A one-dimensional mathematical model of collecting lymphatics coupled with an electro-fluid-mechanical contraction model and valve dynamics', ['Christian Contarino', 'Eleuterio F. Toro'], u'2017-02-20', u'We propose a one-dimensional model for collecting lymphatics coupled with a novel Electro-Fluid-Mechanical Contraction (EFMC) model for dynamical contractions, based on a modified FitzHugh-Nagumo model for action potentials. The one-dimensional model for a compliant lymphatic vessel is a set of hyperbolic Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). The EFMC model combines the electrical activity of lymphangions (action potentials) with fluid-mechanical feedback (stretch of the lymphatic wall and wall shear stress) and the mechanical variation of the lymphatic wall properties (contractions). The EFMC model is governed by four Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) and phenomenologically relies on: (1) environmental calcium influx, (2) stretch-activated calcium influx, and (3) contraction inhibitions induced by wall shear stresses. We carried out a complete mathematical analysis of the stability of the stationary state of the EFMC model. Overall, the EFMC model allows imitating the influence of pressure and wall shear stress on the frequency of contractions observed experimentally. Lymphatic valves are modelled using a well-established lumped-parameter model which allows simulating stenotic and regurgitant valves. We analysed several lymphodynamical indexes of a single lymphangion for a wide range of upstream and downstream pressure combinations. Stenotic and regurgitant valves were modelled, and their effects are here quantified. Results for stenotic valves showed in the downstream lymphangion that for low frequencies of contractions the Calculated Pump Flow (CPF) index remained almost unaltered, while for high frequencies the CPF dramatically decreased depending on the severity of the stenosis (up to 93% for a severe stenosis). Results for incompetent valves showed that the net flow during a lymphatic cycle tends to zero as the degree of incompetence increases.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05830v1', ['Tissues and Organs'], []]
[u'What we learn from the learning rate', ['Rory A. Brittain', 'Nick S. Jones', 'Thomas E. Ouldridge'], u'2017-02-20', u'The learning rate is an information-theoretical quantity for bipartite Markov chains describing two coupled subsystems. It is defined as the rate at which transitions in the downstream subsystem tend to increase the mutual information between the two subsystems, and is bounded by the dissipation arising from these transitions. Its physical interpretation, however, is unclear, although it has been used as a metric for the sensing performance of the downstream subsystem. In this paper we explore the behaviour of the learning rate for a number of simple model systems, establishing when and how its behaviour is distinct from the instantaneous mutual information between subsystems. In the simplest case, the two are almost equivalent. In more complex steady-state systems, the mutual information and the learning rate behave qualitatively distinctly, with the learning rate clearly now reflecting the rate at which the downstream system must update its information in response to changes in the upstream system. It is not clear whether this quantity is the most natural measure for sensor performance, and, indeed, we provide an example in which optimising the learning rate over a region of parameter space of the downstream system yields an apparently sub-optimal sensor.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06041v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
