[u'Statistical thermodynamic basis in drug-receptor interactions: double\n  annihilation and double decoupling alchemical theories, revisited', ['Piero Procacci'], u'2016-07-13', u"Alchemical theory is emerging as a promising tool in the context of molecular\ndynamics simulations for drug discovery projects. In this theoretical\ncontribution, I revisit the statistical mechanics foundation of non covalent\ninteractions in drug-receptor systems, providing a unifying treatment that\nencompasses the most important variants in the alchemical approaches, from the\nseminal Double Annihilation Method by Jorgensen and Ravimohan [W.L. Jorgensen\nand C. Ravimohan, J. Chem. Phys. 83,3050, 1985], to the Gilson's Double\nDecoupling Method [M. K. Gilson and J. A. Given and B. L. Bush and J. A.\nMcCammon, Biophys. J. 72, 1047 1997] and the Deng and Roux alchemical theory\n[Y. Deng and B. Roux, J. Chem. Theory Comput., 2, 1255 2006]. Connections and\ndifferences between the various alchemical approaches are highlighted and\ndiscussed, and finally placed into the broader context of nonequilibrium\nthermodynamics.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03783v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Critical comments on EEG sensor space dynamical connectivity analysis', ['Frederik van de Steen', 'Luca Faes', 'Esin Karahan', 'Jitkomut Songsiri', 'Pedro Antonio Valdes Sosa', 'Daniele Marinazzo'], u'2016-07-13', u'The use of electroencephalography (EEG) to study brain functioning and\ndynamics in humans has known a long history. Over the years, different analysis\ntechniques have been developed and applied to EEG recordings that allow one to\ninvestigate how different brain areas interact. One particular class of\nmethods, based on the linear parametric representation of multiple interacting\ntime series, is widely used to study causal connectivity in the brain in both\nfundamental and clinical neuroscientific research. However, the results\nobtained by these methods should be interpreted with great care. The goal of\nthis paper is to show, both theoretically and using simulations, that results\nobtained by applying causal connectivity measures on the sensor (scalp) time\nseries do not allow interpretation in terms of interacting brain sources.\nAlthough many measures of causal connectivity derived from EEG sensor time\nseries are affected by this, here we will focus on the well-known time domain\nindex of Granger causality (GC) and on the frequency domain directed transfer\nfunction (DTF). Using the state-space framework and designing two different\nsimulation studies we show that mixing effects caused by volume conduction can\nlead to spurious connections, detected either by time domain GC or by DTF, when\ninterpreted in terms of anatomically interacting sources. Therefore, GC/DTF\ncausal connectivity measures should be computed at the source level, or derived\nwithin analysis frameworks that model the effects of volume conduction.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03687v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

Spape', 'Oswald Barral', 'Niklas Ravaja', 'Giulio Jacucci', 'Samuel Kaski'], u'2016-07-12', u"Finding relevant information from large document collections such as the\nWorld Wide Web is a common task in our daily lives. Estimation of a user's\ninterest or search intention is necessary to recommend and retrieve relevant\ninformation from these collections. We introduce a brain-information interface\nused for recommending information by relevance inferred directly from brain\nsignals. In experiments, participants were asked to read Wikipedia documents\nabout a selection of topics while their EEG was recorded. Based on the\nprediction of word relevance, the individual's search intent was modeled and\nsuccessfully used for retrieving new, relevant documents from the whole English\nWikipedia corpus. The results show that the users' interests towards digital\ncontent can be modeled from the brain signals evoked by reading. The introduced\nbrain-relevance paradigm enables the recommendation of information without any\nexplicit user interaction, and may be applied across diverse\ninformation-intensive applications.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03502v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

Vestergaard', 'Eugenio Valdano', 'Mathieu Genois', 'Chiara Poletto', 'Vittoria Colizza', 'Alain Barrat'], u'2016-07-13', u'The ability to directly record human face-to-face interactions increasingly\nenables the development of detailed data-driven models for the spread of\ndirectly transmitted infectious diseases at the scale of individuals. Complete\ncoverage of the contacts occurring in a population is however generally\nunattainable, due for instance to limited participation rates or experimental\nconstraints in spatial coverage. Here, we study the impact of spatially\nconstrained sampling on our ability to estimate the epidemic risk in a\npopulation using such detailed data-driven models. The epidemic risk is\nquantified by the epidemic threshold of the\nsusceptible-infectious-recovered-susceptible model for the propagation of\ncommunicable diseases, i.e. the critical value of disease transmissibility\nabove which the disease turns endemic. We verify for both synthetic and\nempirical data of human interactions that the use of incomplete data sets due\nto spatial sampling leads to the underestimation of the epidemic risk. The bias\nis however smaller than the one obtained by uniformly sampling the same\nfraction of contacts: it depends nonlinearly on the fraction of contacts that\nare recorded and becomes negligible if this fraction is large enough. Moreover,\nit depends on the interplay between the timescales of population and spreading\ndynamics.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03694v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Effect of memory in non-Markovian Boolean networks', ['Haleh Ebadi', 'Meghdad Saeedian', 'Marcel Ausloos', 'GholamReza Jafari'], u'2016-07-13', u'One successful model of interacting biological systems is the Boolean\nnetwork. The dynamics of a Boolean network, controlled with Boolean functions,\nis usually considered to be a Markovian (memory-less) process. However, both\nself organizing features of biological phenomena and their intelligent nature\nshould raise some doubt about ignoring the history of their time evolution.\nHere, we extend the Boolean network Markovian approach: we involve the effect\nof memory on the dynamics. This can be explored by modifying Boolean functions\ninto non-Markovian functions, for example, by investigating the usual\nnon-Markovian threshold function, - one of the most applied Boolean functions.\nBy applying the non-Markovian threshold function on the dynamical process of a\ncell cycle network, we discover a power law memory with a more robust dynamics\nthan the Markovian dynamics.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03794v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
