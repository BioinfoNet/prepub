[u'Metabolite transport through glial networks stabilizes the dynamics of\n  learning', ['Yogesh S. Virkar', 'Woodrow L. Shew', 'Juan G. Restrepo', 'Edward Ott'], u'2016-05-10', u'Learning and memory are acquired through long-lasting changes in synapses. In\nthe simplest models, such synaptic potentiation typically leads to runaway\nexcitation, but in reality there must exist processes that robustly preserve\noverall stability of the neural system dynamics. How is this accomplished?\nVarious approaches to this basic question have been considered. Here we propose\na particularly compelling and natural mechanism for preserving stability of\nlearning neural systems. This mechanism is based on the global processes by\nwhich metabolic resources are distributed to the neurons by glial cells.\nSpecifically, we introduce and study a model comprised of two interacting\nnetworks: a model neural network interconnected by synapses which undergo\nspike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP); and a model glial network\ninterconnected by gap junctions which diffusively transport metabolic resources\namong the glia and, ultimately, to neural synapses where they are consumed. Our\nmain result is that the biophysical constraints imposed by diffusive transport\nof metabolic resources through the glial network can prevent runaway growth of\nsynaptic strength, both during ongoing activity and during learning. Our\nfindings suggest a previously unappreciated role for glial transport of\nmetabolites in the feedback control stabilization of neural network dynamics\nduring learning.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03090v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'A Passage-of-time Model of the Cerebellar Purkinje Cell', ['Matthew Ricci', 'Junkyung Kim', 'Fredrik Johansson'], u'2016-05-10', u"The cerebellar Purkinje cell controlling eyeblinks can learn, remember and\nreproduce the interstimulus interval in a classical conditioning paradigm.\nGiven temporally separated inputs, the cerebellar Purkinje cell learns to pause\nits tonic inhibition of a motor pathway with high temporal precision so that an\novert blink occurs at the right time. Most models relegate the Purkinje cell's\npassage-of-time representation to afferent granule cells, a subpopulation of\nwhich is supposedly selected for synaptic depression in order to make the\nPurkinje cell pause. However, granule cell models have recently faced two\ncrucial challenges: 1) bypassing granule cells and directly stimulating the\nPurkinje cell's pre-synaptic fibers during training still produces a well-timed\npause, and 2) the Purkinje cell can reproduce the learned pause, invariant to\nthe temporal structure of probe stimulation. Here, we present a passage-of-time\nmodel which is internal to the Purkinje cell and is invariant to probe\nstructure. The model accurately simulates the Purkinje cell learning mechanism\nand makes testable electrophysiological predictions. Importantly, the model is\na numerical proof-of-principle for a biological learning mechanism which does\nnot rely on changes of synaptic strength.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03060v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

This is particularly relevant for\npatients in disorders of consciousness (DOC) following severe acquired brain\ndamage and coma, one of the most devastating conditions in modern medical care.\nWe present a novel data-driven methodology, connICA, which implements\nIndependent Component Analysis (ICA) for the extraction of robust independent\nFC patterns (FC-traits) from a set of individual functional connectomes,\nwithout imposing any a priori data stratification into groups. We here apply\nconnICA to investigate associations between network-traits derived from\ntask-free FC and cognitive features that define levels of consciousness. Three\nmain independent FC-traits were identified and linked to consciousness-related\nclinical features. The first one represents the functional configuration of an\n"awake resting" brain, and is associated to the level of arousal. The second\nFC-trait reflects the disconnection of the visual and sensory-motor\nconnectivity patterns and relates to the ability of communicating with the\nexternal environment. The third FC-trait isolates the connectivity pattern\nencompassing the fronto-parietal and the default-mode network areas as well as\nthe interaction between left and right hemisphere, which are also associated to\nthe awareness of the self and its surroundings. Each FC-trait represents a\ndistinct functional process with a role in the degradation of conscious states\nin functional brain networks, shedding further light on the functional\nsubcircuits that get disrupted in severe brain-damage.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03031v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Shaping neural circuits by high order synaptic interactions', ['Neta Ravid Tannenbaum', 'Yoram Burak'], u'2016-05-10', u'Spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) is believed to play an important\nrole in shaping the structure of neural circuits. Here we show that STDP\ngenerates effective interactions between synapses of different neurons, which\nwere neglected in previous theoretical treatments, and can be described as a\nsum over contributions from structural motifs. These interactions can have a\npivotal influence on the connectivity patterns that emerge under the influence\nof STDP. In particular, we consider two highly ordered forms of structure: wide\nsynfire chains, in which groups of neurons project to each other sequentially,\nand self connected assemblies. We show that high order synaptic interactions\ncan enable the formation of both structures, depending on the form of the STDP\nfunction and the time course of synaptic currents. Furthermore, within a\ncertain regime of biophysical parameters, emergence of the ordered connectivity\noccurs robustly and autonomously in a stochastic network of spiking neurons,\nwithout a need to expose the neural network to structured inputs during\nlearning.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03005v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

Mehlig'], u'2016-05-10', u"Genome-wide patterns of genetic divergence reveal mechanisms of adaptation\nunder gene flow. Empirical data show that divergence is mostly concentrated in\nnarrow genomic regions. This pattern may arise because differentiated loci\nprotect nearby mutations from gene flow, but recent theory suggests this\nmechanism is insufficient to explain the emergence of concentrated\ndifferentiation during biologically realistic timescales. Critically, earlier\ntheory neglects an inevitable consequence of genetic drift: stochastic loss of\nlocal genomic divergence. Here we demonstrate that the rate of stochastic loss\nof weak local differentiation increases with recombination distance to a\nstrongly diverged locus and, above a critical recombination distance, local\nloss is faster than local `gain' of new differentiation. Under high migration\nand weak selection this critical recombination distance is much smaller than\nthe total recombination distance of the genomic region under selection.\nConsequently, divergence between populations increases by net gain of new\ndifferentiation within the critical recombination distance, resulting in\ntightly-linked clusters of divergence. The mechanism responsible is the balance\nbetween stochastic loss and gain of weak local differentiation, a mechanism\nacting universally throughout the genome. Our results will help to explain\nempirical observations and lead to novel predictions regarding changes in\ngenomic architectures during adaptive divergence.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03076v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'The large graph limit of a stochastic epidemic model on a dynamic\n  multilayer network', ['Karly A. Jacobsen', 'Mark G. Burch', 'Joseph H. Tien', 'Grzegorz A. Rempaa'], u'2016-05-10', u'We consider an SIR-type (Susceptible $\\to$ Infected $\\to$ Recovered)\nstochastic epidemic process with multiple modes of transmission on a contact\nnetwork. The network is given by a random graph following a multilayer\nconfiguration model where edges in different layers correspond to potentially\ninfectious contacts of different types. We assume that the graph structure\nevolves in response to the epidemic via activation or deactivation of edges. We\nderive a large graph limit theorem that gives a system of ordinary differential\nequations (ODEs) describing the evolution of quantities of interest, such as\nthe proportions of infected and susceptible vertices, as the number of nodes\ntends to infinity. Analysis of the limiting system elucidates how the coupling\nof edge activation and deactivation to infection status affects disease\ndynamics, as illustrated by a two-layer network example with edge types\ncorresponding to community and healthcare contacts. Our theorem extends some\nearlier results deriving the deterministic limit of stochastic SIR processes on\nstatic, single-layer configuration model graphs. We also describe precisely the\nconditions for equivalence between our limiting ODEs and the systems obtained\nvia pair approximation, which are widely used in the epidemiological and\necological literature to approximate disease dynamics on networks. Potential\napplications include modeling Ebola dynamics in West Africa, which was the\nmotivation for this study.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02809v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Unifying Dynamical and Structural Stability of Equilibriums', ['Jean-Francois Arnoldi', 'Bart Haegeman'], u'2016-05-09', u"We exhibit a fundamental relationship between measures of dynamical and\nstructural stability of equilibriums, arising from real dynamical systems. We\nshow that dynamical stability, quantified via systems local response to\nexternal perturbations, coincides with the minimal internal perturbation able\nto destabilize the equilibrium. First, by reformulating a result of control\ntheory, we explain that harmonic external perturbations reflect the spectral\nsensitivity of the Jacobian matrix at the equilibrium, with respect to constant\nchanges of its coefficients. However, for this equivalence to hold, imaginary\nchanges of the Jacobian's coefficients have to be allowed. The connection with\ndynamical stability is thus lost for real dynamical systems. We show that this\nissue can be avoided, thus recovering the fundamental link between dynamical\nand structural stability, by considering stochastic noise as external and\ninternal perturbations. More precisely, we demonstrate that a system's local\nresponse to white-noise perturbations directly reflects the intensity of\ninternal white noise that it can accommodate before asymptotic mean-square\nstability of the equilibrium is lost.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02725v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Steric effects induce geometric remodeling of actin bundles in filopodia', ['Ulrich Dobramysl', 'Garegin A. Papoian', 'Radek Erban'], u'2016-05-10', u'Filopodia are ubiquitous fingerlike protrusions, spawned by many eukaryotic\ncells, to probe and interact with their environments. Polymerization dynamics\nof actin filaments, comprising the structural core of filopodia, largely\ndetermine their instantaneous lengths and overall lifetimes. The polymerization\nreactions at the filopodial tip require transport of G-actin, which enter the\nfilopodial tube from the filopodial base and diffuse toward the filament barbed\nends near the tip. Actin filaments are mechanically coupled into a tight bundle\nby cross-linker proteins. Interestingly, many of these proteins are relatively\nshort, restricting the free diffusion of cytosolic G-actin throughout the\nbundle and, in particular, its penetration into the bundle core. To investigate\nthe effect of steric restrictions on G-actin diffusion by the porous structure\nof filopodial actin filament bundle, we used a particle-based stochastic\nsimulation approach. We discovered that excluded volume interactions result in\npartial and then full collapse of central filaments in the bundle, leading to a\nhollowed-out structure. The latter may further collapse radially due to the\nactivity of cross-linking proteins, hence producing conical-shaped filament\nbundles. Interestingly, electron microscopy experiments on mature filopodia\nindeed frequently reveal actin bundles that are narrow at the tip and wider at\nthe base. Overall, our work demonstrates that excluded volume effects in the\ncontext of reaction-diffusion processes in porous networks may lead to\nunexpected geometric growth patterns and complicated, history-dependent\ndynamics of intermediate metastable configurations.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03119v1', ['Subcellular Processes'], []]
[u'Target shape dependence in a simple model of receptor-mediated\n  endocytosis and phagocytosis', ['David M. Richards', 'Robert G. Endres'], u'2016-05-10', u'Phagocytosis and receptor-mediated endocytosis are vitally important particle\nuptake mechanisms in many cell types, ranging from single-cell organisms to\nimmune cells. In both processes, engulfment by the cell depends critically on\nboth particle shape and orientation. However, most previous theoretical work\nhas focused only on spherical particles and hence disregards the wide-ranging\nparticle shapes occurring in nature, such as those of bacteria. Here, by\nimplementing a simple model in one and two dimensions, we compare and contrast\nreceptor-mediated endocytosis and phagocytosis for a range of biologically\nrelevant shapes, including spheres, ellipsoids, capped cylinders, and\nhourglasses. We find a whole range of different engulfment behaviors with some\nellipsoids engulfing faster than spheres, and that phagocytosis is able to\nengulf a greater range of target shapes than other types of endocytosis.\nFurther, the 2D model can explain why some nonspherical particles engulf\nfastest (not at all) when presented to the membrane tip-first (lying flat). Our\nwork reveals how some bacteria may avoid being internalized simply because of\ntheir shape, and suggests shapes for optimal drug delivery.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02992v1', ['Cell Behavior'], []]
[u'Run and tumble navigation can be very fast', ['Junjiajia Long', 'Steven W. Zucker', 'Thierry Emonet'], u'2016-05-10', u'The ability to navigate environmental gradients is often critical for\nsurvival. When gradients are shallow or noisy, most organisms move by\nalternating straight motion (runs) with random reorientations (tumbles).\nNavigation is achieved by transiently reducing the probability to tumble when\nattractant signal increases. One drawback of this strategy is that occasional\nruns in the wrong direction reduce progress up the gradient. Here we discovered\na positive feedback regime inherent in this strategy that strongly mitigates\nthis problem. In an attractant field, motion up the gradient reduces tumble\nprobability, which further boosts drift up the gradient. This positive feedback\ncan drive large fluctuations in the internal state of the organism away from\nits mean, resulting in long runs in favorable directions but short ones\notherwise. In this new regime the organism achieves a "ratchet-like" gradient\nclimbing behavior unexpected from mean field theory, and drift speeds much\nfaster than previously believed possible.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02977v1', ['Cell Behavior'], []]
