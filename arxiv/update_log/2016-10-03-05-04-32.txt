[u'A fast, open source implementation of adaptive biasing potentials\n  uncovers a ligand design strategy for the chromatin regulator BRD4', ['Bradley M. Dickson', 'Parker W de Waal', 'Zachary H Ramjan', 'H Eric Xu', 'Scott B. Rothbart'], u'2016-09-30', u'In this communication we introduce an efficient implementation of adaptive\nbiasing that greatly improves the speed of free energy computation in molecular\ndynamics simulations. We investigated the use of accelerated simulations to\ninform on compound design using a recently reported and clinically relevant\ninhibitor of the chromatin regulator BRD4. Benchmarking on our local compute\ncluster, our implementation achieves up to 2.5 times more force calls per day\nthan plumed2. Results of five 1{\\mu}second-long simulations are presented,\nwhich reveal a conformational switch in the BRD4 inhibitor between a binding\ncompetent and incompetent state. Stabilization of the switch led to a -3\nkcal/mol improvement of absolute binding free energy. These studies suggest an\nunexplored ligand design principle and offer new actionable hypotheses for\nmedicinal chemistry efforts against this druggable epigenetic target class.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09833v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Neural Ideals in SageMath', ['Ethan Petersen', 'Nora Youngs', 'Ryan Kruse', 'Dane Miyata', 'Rebecca Garcia', 'Luis David Garcia Puente'], u'2016-09-30', u'A major area in neuroscience research is the study of how the brain processes\nspatial information. Neurons in the brain represent external stimuli via neural\ncodes. These codes often arise from stereotyped stimulus-response maps,\nassociating to each neuron a convex receptive field. An important problem\nconsists in determining what stimulus space features can be extracted directly\nfrom a neural code. The neural ideal is an algebraic object that encodes the\nfull combinatorial data of a neural code. This ideal can be expressed in a\ncanonical form that directly translates to a minimal description of the\nreceptive field structure intrinsic to the code. In here, we describe a\nSageMath package that contains several algorithms related to the canonical form\nof a neural ideal.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09602v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Optimized motor imagery paradigm based on imagining Chinese characters\n  writing movement', ['Zhaoyang Qiu', 'Brendan Z. Allison', 'Jing Jin', 'Yu Zhang', 'Xingyu Wang', 'Wei Li', 'Andrzej Cichocki'], u'2016-09-30', u"Motor imagery (MI) is a mental representation of motor behavior that has been\nwidely used as a control method for a brain-computer interface (BCI), allowing\ncommunication for the physically impaired. The performance of MI based BCI\nmainly depends on the subject's ability to self-modulate EEG signals. Proper\ntraining can help naive subjects learn to modulate brain activity proficiently.\nHowever, training subjects typically involves abstract motor tasks and is\ntime-consuming. To improve the performance of naive subjects during motor\nimagery, a novel paradigm was presented that would guide naive subjects to\nmodulate brain activity effectively. In this new paradigm, pictures of the left\nor right hand were used as cues for subjects to finish the motor imagery task.\nFourteen healthy subjects (11 male, aged 22-25 years, mean 23.6+/-1.16)\nparticipated in this study. The task was to imagine writing a Chinese\ncharacter. Specifically, subjects could imagine hand movements following the\nsequence of writing strokes in the Chinese character. This paradigm was meant\nto find an effective and familiar action for most Chinese people, to provide\nthem with a specific, extensively practiced task and help them modulate brain\nactivity. Results showed that the writing task paradigm yielded significantly\nbetter performance than the traditional arrow paradigm (p<0.001). Questionnaire\nreplies indicated that most subjects thought the new paradigm was easier and\nmore comfortable. The proposed new motor imagery paradigm could guide subjects\nto help them modulate brain activity effectively. Results showed that there\nwere significant improvements using new paradigm, both in classification\naccuracy and usability.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09578v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
