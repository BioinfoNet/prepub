[u'Lightweight Interactions for Reciprocal Cooperation in a Social Network\n  Game', ['Masanori Takano', 'Kazuya Wada', 'Ichiro Fukuda'], u'2016-11-08', u'The construction of reciprocal relationships requires cooperative\ninteractions during the initial meetings. However, cooperative behavior with\nstrangers is risky because the strangers may be exploiters. In this study, we\nshow that people increase the likelihood of cooperativeness of strangers by\nusing lightweight non-risky interactions in risky situations based on the\nanalysis of a social network game (SNG). They can construct reciprocal\nrelationships in this manner. The interactions involve low-cost signaling\nbecause they are not generated at any cost to the senders and recipients.\nTheoretical studies show that low-cost signals are not guaranteed to be\nreliable because the low-cost signals from senders can lie at any time.\nHowever, people used low-cost signals to construct reciprocal relationships in\nan SNG, which suggests the existence of mechanisms for generating reliable,\nlow-cost signals in human evolution.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02419v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

[u'Quantification of heparin in complex matrices (including urine) using a\n  mix-and-read fluorescence assay', ['Ulrich Warttinger', 'Roland Kramer'], u'2016-11-08', u'Heparin is an important anticoagulant drug, about one billion doses are\nproduced annually. It is a polydisperse sulfated polysaccharide, and the\ninherent heterogeneity makes the analysis of heparin difficult. The global\ncrisis resulting from adulterated heparin in 2008 has drawn renewed attention\nto the challenges that are associated with the quality control and\ncharacterization of this complex biological medicine from natural sources. The\npresent study addresses the need for simple and user-friendly analytical\nmethods for the fast and accurate quantification of heparin in complex\nmatrices. Direct quantification of heparin in the low microgram per mL range\nwas accomplished using a specific commercially available assay based on the\nfluorescent molecular probe Heparin Red, simply by mixing the heparin\ncontaining sample and a reagent solution in a 96-well microplate followed by\nfluorescence readout. A screening of typical impurities in raw heparin\n(selected other glycosaminoglycans, residual nucleic acids and proteins),\nrelated to the extraction from animal tissues, as well as of components of the\nurine matrix (inorganic salts, amino acids, trace proteins) revealed that these\ncompounds even in large excess have no or very little effect on the accuracy of\nheparin determination. Heparin spike detection in urine, a biological\nmulticomponent matrix, also showed good accuracy. We envision applications of\nthis mix-and-read assay in the process and quality control in heparin\nmanufacturing, but also in pharmacokinetic studies as a convenient tool for\nmeasuring of the urinary excretion of heparins.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02482v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]

Nevertheless, not only does the ellipsoid formula used today\nunderestimate true renal size but also the relation governing renal size and\ncollagen content remains unclear. We used coronal kidney sections from healthy\nmice and mice with renal disease to develop a new technique for estimating the\nrenal parenchymal area. While treating the kidney as an ellipse with the major\naxis the polar distance, this technique involves extending the minor axis into\nthe renal pelvis. The calculated renal parenchymal area is remarkably similar\nto the measured area. Biochemically determined kidney collagen content revealed\na strong and positive correlation with the calculated renal parenchymal area.\nThe extent of renal scarring, i.e. kidney collagen content, can now be computed\nby making just two renal axial measurements which can easily be accomplished\nvia noninvasive imaging of this organ.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02317v1', ['Tissues and Organs'], []]

The main challenge of this technology is increasing\nthe local tumoral temperature with minimal side effects on the surrounding\nhealthy tissue. This work consists of an in vitro study that compared the\neffect of hyperthermia in response to the application of exogenous heating\n(EHT) sources with the corresponding effect produced by magnetic hyperthermia\n(MHT) at the same target temperatures. Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were\nloaded with magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) and packed into dense pellets to\ngenerate an environment that is crudely similar to that expected in solid\nmicro-tumors, and the above-mentioned protocols were applied to these cells.\nThese experiments showed that for the same target temperatures, MHT induces a\ndecrease in cell viability that is larger than the corresponding EHT, up to a\nmaximum difference of approximately 45\\% at T = 46{\\deg}C. An analysis of the\ndata in terms of temperature efficiency demonstrated that MHT requires an\naverage temperature that is 6{\\deg}C lower than that required with EHT to\nproduce a similar cytotoxic effect. An analysis of electron microscopy images\nof the cells after the EHT and MHT treatments indicated that the enhanced\neffectiveness observed with MHT is associated with local cell destruction\ntriggered by the magnetic nano-heaters. The present study is an essential step\ntoward the development of innovative adjuvant anti-cancer therapies based on\nlocal hyperthermia treatments using magnetic particles as nano-heaters.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02597v1', ['Tissues and Organs'], []]
[u'Synchrony in a Boolean network model of the L-arabinose operon in\n  Escherichia coli', ['Andy Jenkins', 'Matthew Macauley'], u'2016-11-08', u"The lactose operon in Escherichia coli was the first known gene regulatory\nnetwork, and it is frequently used as a prototype for new modeling paradigms.\nHistorically, many of these modeling frameworks use differential equations.\nMore recently, Stigler and Veliz-Cuba proposed a Boolean network model that\ncaptures the bistability of the system and all of the biological steady states.\nIn this paper, we model the well-known arabinose operon in E. coli with a\nBoolean network. This has several complex features not found in the lac operon,\nsuch as a protein that is both an activator and repressor, a DNA looping\nmechanism for gene repression, and the lack of inducer exclusion by glucose.\nFor 11 out of 12 choices of initial conditions, we use computational algebra\nand Sage to verify that the state space contains a single fixed point that\ncorrectly matches the biology. The final initial condition, medium levels of\narabinose and no glucose, successfully predicts the system's bistability.\nFinally, we compare the state space under synchronous and asynchronous update,\nand see that the former has several artificial cycles that go away under a\ngeneral asynchronous update.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02656v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
[u'Energy-based Analysis of Biomolecular Pathways', ['Peter J. Gawthrop', 'Edmund J. Crampin'], u'2016-11-07', u'Decomposition of biomolecular reaction networks into pathways is a powerful\napproach to the analysis of metabolic and signalling networks. Current\napproaches based on analysis of the stoichiometric matrix reveal information\nabout steady-state mass flows (reaction rates) through the network. In this\nwork we show how pathway analysis of biomolecular networks can be extended\nusing an energy-based approach to provide information about energy flows\nthrough the network. This energy-based approach is developed using the\nengineering-inspired bond graph methodology to represent biomolecular reaction\nnetworks.\n  The approach is introduced using glycolysis as an exemplar; and is then\napplied to analyse the efficiency of free energy transduction in a biomolecular\ncycle model of a transporter protein (Sodium-Glucose Transport Protein 1,\nSGLT1).\n  The overall aim of our work is to present a framework for modelling and\nanalysis of biomolecular reactions and processes which considers energy flows\nand losses as well as mass transport.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02332v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
[u'Inferring disease causing genes and their pathways: A mathematical\n  perspective', ['Jeethu V.

A molecular\ninteraction network formed of differentially expressed genes and their\ninteractions helps to understand key players behind disease development. So, if\nthe functions of these genes are blocked by altering their interactions, it\nwould have a great impact in controlling the disease. Due to this promising\nconsequence, the problem of inferring disease causing genes and their pathways\nhas attained a crucial position in computational biology research. However,\nconsidering the huge size of interaction networks, executing computations can\nbe costly. Review of literatures shows that the methods proposed for finding\nthe set of disease causing genes could be assessed in terms of their accuracy\nwhich a perfect algorithm would find. Along with accuracy, the time complexity\nof the method is also important, as high time complexities would limit the\nnumber of pathways that could be found within a pragmatic time interval.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02538v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
[u'Clusters of calcium release channels harness the Ising phase transition\n  to confine their elementary intracellular signals', ['Anna Maltsev', 'Victor Maltsev', 'Michael Stern'], u'2016-11-07', u'Intracellular Ca signals represent a universal mechanism of cell function.\nMessages carried by Ca are local, rapid, and powerful enough to be delivered\nover the thermal noise. A higher signal to noise ratio is achieved by a\ncooperative action of Ca release channels such as IP3 receptors or ryanodine\nreceptors arranged in clusters or release units containing a few to several\nhundred release channels. The release channels synchronize their openings via\nCa-induced-Ca-release, generating high-amplitude local Ca signals known as\npuffs in neurons or sparks in muscle cells. Despite the high release amplitude\nand positive feedback nature of the activation, Ca signals are strictly\nconfined in time and space by an unexplained termination mechanism. Here we\nshow that the collective transition of release channels from an open to a\nclosed state is identical to the phase transition associated with the reversal\nof magnetic field in an Ising ferromagnet. We demonstrate this mechanism using\nnumerical model simulations of Ca sparks over a wide range of cluster sizes\nfrom 25 to 169 release channels. While prior studies suggested contributions of\nstochastic attrition and Ca store depletion, our new simple quantitative\ncriterion closely predicts the depletion level required for spark termination\nfor each cluster size. We further formulate exact requirements for a cluster of\nrelease channels to follow the Ising model in any cell type. Thus we describe\ndeterministically the behaviour of a system on a coarser scale (release unit)\nwhich is random on a finer scale (release channels), bridging the gap between\nscales. Our results provide the first exact mapping of a nanoscale biological\nsignalling model to an interacting particle system in statistical physics,\nmaking the extensive mathematical apparatus available to quantitative biology.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02277v1', ['Cell Behavior'], []]
