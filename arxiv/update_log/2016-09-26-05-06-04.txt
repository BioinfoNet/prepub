[u'Towards the bio-personalization of music recommendation systems: A\n  single-sensor EEG biomarker of subjective music preference', ['Dimitrios A. Adamos', 'Stavros I. Dimitriadis', 'Nikolaos A. Laskaris'], u'2016-09-21', u'Recent advances in biosensors technology and mobile electroencephalographic\n(EEG) interfaces have opened new application fields for cognitive monitoring. A\ncomputable biomarker for the assessment of spontaneous aesthetic brain\nresponses during music listening is introduced here. It derives from\nwell-established measures of cross-frequency coupling (CFC) and quantifies the\nmusic-induced alterations in the dynamic relationships between brain rhythms.\nDuring a stage of exploratory analysis, and using the signals from a suitably\ndesigned experiment, we established the biomarker, which acts on brain\nactivations recorded over the left prefrontal cortex and focuses on the\nfunctional coupling between high-beta and low-gamma oscillations. Based on data\nfrom an additional experimental paradigm, we validated the introduced biomarker\nand showed its relevance for expressing the subjective aesthetic appreciation\nof a piece of music. Our approach resulted in an affordable tool that can\npromote human-machine interaction and, by serving as a personalized music\nannotation strategy, can be potentially integrated into modern flexible music\nrecommendation systems.\n  Keywords: Cross-frequency coupling; Human-computer interaction;\nBrain-computer interface', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07365v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], [u'School of Music Studies, Faculty of Fine Arts, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki', u'AIIA Lab, Department of Informatics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki']]
[u'Modeling of Sensory Characteristics Based on the Growth of Food Spoilage\n  Bacteria', ['D. Valenti', 'G. Denaro', 'F. Giarratana', 'A. Giuffrida', 'S. Mazzola', 'G. Basilone', 'S. Aronica', 'A. Bonanno', 'B. Spagnolo'], u'2016-09-23', u'During last years theoretical works shed new light and proposed new\nhypothesis on the mechanisms which regulate the time behaviour of biological\npopulations in different natural systems. Despite of this, the role of\nenvironmental variables in ecological systems is still an open question.\nFilling this gap of knowledge is a crucial task for a deeper comprehension of\nthe dynamics of biological populations in real ecosystems. In this work we\nstudy how the dynamics of food spoilage bacteria influences the sensory\ncharacteristics of fresh fish specimens. This topic is crucial for a better\nunderstanding of the role played by the bacterial growth on the organoleptic\nproperties, and for the quality evaluation and risk assessment of food\nproducts. We therefore analyze the time behaviour, in fresh fish specimens, of\nsensory characteristics starting from the growth curves of two spoilage\nbacterial communities. The theoretical study, initially based on a\ndeterministic model, exploits experimental temperature profiles. As a first\nstep, a model of predictive microbiology is used to reproduce the experimental\nbehaviour of the two bacterial populations. Afterwards, the theoretical\nbacterial growths are converted, through suitable differential equations, into\n"sensory" scores, based on the Quality Index Method (QIM), a scoring system for\nfreshness and quality sensory estimation of fishery products. As a third step,\nthe theoretical curves of QIM scores are compared with the experimental data\nobtained by sensory analysis. Finally, the differential equations for QIM\nscores are modified by adding terms of multiplicative white noise, which mimics\nthe effects of uncertainty and variability in sensory analysis. A better\nagreement between experimental and theoretical QIM scores is observed, in some\ncases, in the presence of suitable values of noise intensity respect to the\ndeterministic analysis.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07426v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Cooperation in the two-population snowdrift game with punishment\n  enforced through different mechanisms', ['Andre Barreira da Silva Rocha'], u'2016-09-22', u'I study two mechanisms based on punishment to promote cooperation in the\ntwo-population snowdrift game. The first mechanism follows the traditional\napproach in the literature and is based on the inclusion of a third additional\nstrategy in the payoff matrix of the stage-game. The second mechanism consists\nof letting cooperators to punish defectors with a given exogenous frequency.\nWhile both mechanisms share the same result regarding the minimum required\nlevel of punishment in order to eliminate defectors in both populations,\nstability in the mechanism following the second approach is more robust in the\nsense that extinction of defectors is a globally asymptotically stable state\nfor any interior initial conditions in the phase space. Results were obtained\nanalytically through non-linear differential equations and also using an\nagent-based simulation. There was a good level of agreement between both\napproaches with respect to the evolutionary pattern over time and the possible\nsteady-states.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07179v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Growth and proline content in NaCl stressed plants of annual medic\n  species', ['Khalil Cherifi', 'Abdelmajid Haddioui', 'Mohammed El Hansali', 'El Houssein Boufous'], u'2016-09-23', u'Wild populations of Medicago ciliaris and Medicago polymorpha were subjected\nto four salt treatments 0, 50, 100 and 150 mM NaCl, plant growth and proline\nconcentration in leaves were assessed. The analyzed data revealed significant\nvariability in salt response within and between the two species, depending on\nthe salinity level. It was found that high NaCl concentrations affected all the\ngrowth parameters. However, the reduction was more important at higher NaCl\nconcentrations and the highest reduction was obtained for the populations of\nMedicago polymorpha where it reached around 90% in root length at 150 mM NaCl\nfor Pmar. The Tunisian population of Medicago ciliaris, prospected on soils\naffected by salinity, was the best tolerant in all ecotypes studied in this\nwork. This population, exhibits a particular adaptability to salt environment\nat both germination and seedling stage. Furthermore, the correlation among the\nstudied plants sensitivity and leaf proline concentration showed that high\nproline contents were related to their reactivity to salt. Consequently, it\nappeared that proline biosynthesis occurred presumably as a consequence of\ndisturbance in cell homoeostasis and reflected poor performance and greater\ndamage in response to salt stress. These findings indicated that this osmolytes\ncontent may be used as another useful criterion to differentiate salt-tolerant\nfrom salt sensitive plant in annual medics.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07140v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Non-invasive evaluation of skin tension lines with elastic waves', ['Claire Deroy', 'Michel Destrade', 'Aidan Mc Alinden', 'Aisling Ni Annaidh'], u'2016-09-23', u'Background: Since their discovery by Karl Langer in the 19th Century, Skin\nTension Lines (STLs) have been used by surgeons to decide the location and\norientation of an incision. Although these lines are patient-specific, most\nsurgeons rely on generic maps to determine their orientation. Beyond the\nimprecise pinch test, there remains no accepted method for determining STLs in\nvivo.\n  Methods: (i) The speed of an elastic motion travelling radially on the skin\nof canine cadavers was measured with a commercial device called the\nReviscometer. (ii) Similar to the original experiments conducted by Karl\nLanger, circular excisions were made on the skin and the geometric changes to\nthe resulting wounds and excised samples were used to determine the orientation\nof STLs.\n  Results: A marked anisotropy in the speed of the elastic wave travelling\nradially was observed. The orientation of the fastest wave was found to\ncorrelate with the orientation of the elongated wound (P<0.001, R^2 = 74%).\nSimilarly, the orientation of fastest wave was the same for both in vivo and\nexcised isolated samples, indicating that the STLs have a structural basis.\nResulting wounds expanded by an average area of 9% (+16% along STL and -10%\nacross) while excised skin shrunk by an average area of 33% (23% along STL and\n10% across).\n  Conclusion: Elastic surface wave propagation has been validated\nexperimentally as a robust method for determining the orientation of STLs\nnon-destructively and non-invasively. This study has implications for the\nidentification of STLs and for the prediction of skin tension levels, both\nimportant factors in both human and veterinary reconstructive surgery.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07267v1', ['Tissues and Organs'], []]
[u'The Evolving Definition of Sepsis', ['Todd Gary', 'Damian Mingle', 'Ashwini Yenamandra'], u'2016-09-23', u'Sepsis affects millions of people worldwide each year. It occurs when a\nnormal human immune response to a bacterial, viral or fungal infection becomes\ndysfunctional and triggers widespread inflammation that results in severe\ntissue damage that leads to organ failure, shock, and death. Sepsis, requires\nimmediate treatment and has a high readmission rate for survivors. It is also\none of the most expensive conditions to treat. In 2013, there were more than\n1.6 million cases of sepsis in the United States with a financial cost of more\nthan $23 billion. Sepsis was first described in antiquity, and given its\ncurrent name, by the ancient Greek physician Hippocrates. Despite its long\nmedical history, severity, and financial burden, the causes of sepsis are not\nwell understood, and there is no standard approach to diagnosis and treatment.\nThe definition of sepsis, the characterization of its clinical stages, and\nsepsis monitoring tools have changed three times in the past 25 years, most\nrecently in March 2016. The universal adoption of this latest definition,\nsepsis-3, and a screening tool, qSOFA, are currently under debate in the\nmedical community. A means to rapidly identify and treat sepsis could reduce\nthe five million deaths due to sepsis each year worldwide. This paper reviews\nthe evolution of the definition of sepsis and the controversy surrounding the\nsepsis-3 definition and the sepsis screening tool, qSOFA.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07214v1', ['Tissues and Organs'], []]
[u'Effect of gene-expression bursts on stochastic timing of cellular events', ['Khem Raj Ghusinga', 'Abhyudai Singh'], u'2016-09-23', u'Gene expression is inherently a noisy process which manifests as cell-to-cell\nvariability in time evolution of proteins. Consequently, events that trigger at\ncritical threshold levels of regulatory proteins exhibit stochasticity in their\ntiming. An important contributor to the noise in gene expression is translation\nbursts which correspond to randomness in number of proteins produced in a\nsingle mRNA lifetime. Modeling timing of an event as a first-passage time (FPT)\nproblem, we explore the effect of burst size distribution on event timing.\nTowards this end, the probability density function of FPT is computed for a\ngene expression model with burst size drawn from a generic non-negative\ndistribution. Analytical formulas for FPT moments are provided in terms of\nknown vectors and inverse of a matrix. The effect of burst size distribution is\ninvestigated by looking at how the feedback regulation strategy that minimizes\nnoise in timing around a given time deviates from the case when burst is\ndeterministic. Interestingly, results show that the feedback strategy for\ndeterministic burst case is quite robust to change in burst size distribution,\nand deviations from it are confined to about 20% of the optimal value. These\nfindings facilitate an improved understanding of noise regulation in event\ntiming.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07461v1', ['Subcellular Processes'], []]
[u'Nonlinear self-adapting wave patterns', ['David A. Kessler', 'Herbert Levine'], u'2016-09-23', u'We propose a new type of traveling wave pattern, one that can adapt to the\nsize of physical system in which it is embedded. Such a system arises when the\ninitial state has an instability that extends down to zero wavevector,\nconnecting at that point to two symmetry modes of the underlying dynamical\nsystem. The Min system of proteins in E. coli is such as system with the\nsymmetry emerging from the global conservation of two proteins, MinD and MinE.\nFor this and related systems, traveling waves can adiabatically deform as the\nsystem is increased in size without the increase in node number that would be\nexpected for an oscillatory version of a Turing instability containing an\nallowed wavenumber band with a finite minimum.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07292v1', ['Subcellular Processes'], []]
