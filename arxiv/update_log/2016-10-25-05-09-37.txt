[u'A single step protein assay that is both detergent and reducer\n  compatible: The cydex blue assay', ['Thierry Rabilloud'], u'2016-10-24', u'Determination of protein concentration in often an absolute pre-requisite in\npreparing samples for biochemical and proteomic analyses. However, current\nprotein assay methods are not compatible with both reducers and detergents,\nwhich are however present simultaneously in most denaturing extraction buffers\nused in proteomics and electrophoresis, and in particular in SDS\nelectrophoresis. We found that inclusion of cyclodextrins in a Coomassie\nblue-based assay made it compatible with detergents, as cyclodextrins complex\ndetergents in a 1:1 molecular ratio. As this type of assay is intrinsically\nresistant to reducers, we have thus developed a single step assay that is both\ndetergent and reducer compatible. Depending on the type and concentration of\ndetergents present in the sample buffer, either beta-cyclodextrin or\nalpha-cyclodextrin can be used, the former being able to complex a wider range\nof detergents and the latter being able to complex higher amounts of detergents\ndue to its greater solubility in water. Cyclodextrins are used at final\nconcentrations of 2-10 mg/mL in the assay mix. This typically allows to measure\nsamples containing as little as 0.1 mg/mL protein, in the presence of up to 2%\ndetergent and reducers such as 5 % mercaptoethanol or 50 mM DTT in a single\nstep with a simple spectrophotometric assay.

[u'Maximum-likelihood, self-consistent side chain free energies with\n  applications to protein molecular dynamics', ['John M. Jumper', 'Karl F. Freed', 'Tobin R. Sosnick'], u'2016-10-24', u'To address the large gap between time scales that can be easily reached by\nmolecular simulations and those required to understand protein dynamics, we\npropose a new methodology that computes a self-consistent approximation of the\nside chain free energy at every integration step. In analogy with the adiabatic\nBorn-Oppenheimer approximation in which the nuclear dynamics are governed by\nthe energy of the instantaneously-equilibrated electronic degrees of freedom,\nthe protein backbone dynamics are simulated as preceding according to the\ndictates of the free energy of an instantaneously-equilibrated side chain\npotential. The side chain free energy is computed on the fly; hence, the\nprotein backbone dynamics traverse a greatly smoothed energetic landscape,\nresulting in extremely rapid equilibration and sampling of the Boltzmann\ndistribution. Because our method employs a reduced model involving single-bead\nside chains, we also provide a novel, maximum-likelihood type method to\nparameterize the side chain model using input data from high resolution protein\ncrystal structures. The potential applications of our method are illustrated by\nsimulations of small proteins using replica exchange techniques.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.07277v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'STDP allows close-to-optimal spatiotemporal spike pattern detection by\n  single coincidence detector neurons', ['Timothee Masquelier'], u'2016-10-24', u'By recording multiple cells simultaneously, electrophysiologists have found\nevidence for repeating spatiotemporal spike patterns. In sensory systems in\nparticular, repeating a sensory sequence typically elicits a reproducible spike\npattern, which carries information about the sensory sequence. How this\ninformation is readout by downstream neurons is unclear. In this theoretical\npaper, we investigate to what extent a single cell could detect a given spike\npattern and what are the optimal parameters to do so, in particular the\nmembrane time constant $\\tau$. Using a leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron\nwith instantaneous synapses and homogeneous Poisson inputs, we computed this\noptimum analytically. Our results indicate that a relatively small $\\tau$ (at\nmost a few tens of ms) is usually optimal, even when the pattern is longer.\nThis is somewhat surprising as the resulting detector ignores most of the\npattern, due to its fast memory decay. Next, we wondered if\nspike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) could enable a neuron to reach the\ntheoretical optimum. We simulated a LIF neuron equipped with additive STDP, and\nrepeatedly exposed to a given input spike pattern. As in previous studies, the\nLIF progressively became selective to the repeating pattern with no\nsupervision, even when the pattern was embedded in Poisson activity. Here we\nshow that, using certain STDP parameters, the resulting pattern detector can be\noptimal. Taken together, these results may explain how humans can learn\nrepeating visual or auditory sequences. Long sequences could be recognized\nthanks to coincidence detectors working at a much shorter timescale. This is\nconsistent with the fact that recognition is still possible if a sound sequence\nis compressed of played backward, or scrambled using 10ms bins. Coincidence\ndetection is a simple yet powerful mechanism, which could be the main function\nof neurons in the brain.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.07355v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Death and rebirth of neural activity in sparse inhibitory networks', ['David Angulo-Garcia', 'Stefano Luccioli', 'Simona Olmi', 'Alessandro Torcini'], u'2016-10-23', u"In this paper, we clarify the mechanisms underlying a general phenomenon\npresent in pulse-coupled heterogeneous inhibitory networks: inhibition can\ninduce not only suppression of the neural activity, as expected, but it can\nalso promote neural reactivation. In particular, for globally coupled systems,\nthe number of firing neurons monotonically reduces upon increasing the strength\nof inhibition (neurons' death). However, the random pruning of the connections\nis able to reverse the action of inhibition, i.e. in a sparse network a\nsufficiently strong synaptic strength can surprisingly promote, rather than\ndepress, the activity of the neurons (neurons' rebirth). Thus the number of\nfiring neurons reveals a minimum at some intermediate synaptic strength. We\nshow that this minimum signals a transition from a regime dominated by the\nneurons with higher firing activity to a phase where all neurons are\neffectively sub-threshold and their irregular firing is driven by current\nfluctuations. We explain the origin of the transition by deriving an analytic\nmean field formulation of the problem able to provide the fraction of active\nneurons as well as the first two moments of their firing statistics. The\nintroduction of a synaptic time scale does not modify the main aspects of the\nreported phenomenon. However, for sufficiently slow synapses the transition\nbecomes dramatic, the system passes from a perfectly regular evolution to an\nirregular bursting dynamics. In this latter regime the model provides\npredictions consistent with experimental findings for a specific class of\nneurons, namely the medium spiny neurons in the striatum.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.07181v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

[u'Enumeration of ancestral configurations for matching gene trees and\n  species trees', ['Filippo Disanto', 'Noah A.

They have been introduced as a data structure for use in the\nrecursive computation of the conditional probability under the multispecies\ncoalescent model of a gene tree topology given a species tree, the cost of this\ncomputation being affected by the number of ancestral configurations of the\ngene tree in the species tree. For matching gene trees and species trees, we\nobtain enumerative results on ancestral configurations. We study ancestral\nconfigurations in balanced and unbalanced families of trees determined by a\ngiven seed tree, showing that for seed trees with more than one taxon, the\nnumber of ancestral configurations increases for both families exponentially in\nthe number of taxa $n$. For fixed $n$, the maximal number of ancestral\nconfigurations tabulated at the species tree root node and the largest number\nof labeled histories possible for a labeled topology occur for trees with\nprecisely the same unlabeled shape. For ancestral configurations at the root,\nthe maximum increases with $k_0^n$, where $k_0 \\approx 1.5028$ is a quadratic\nrecurrence constant.

[u'Combination with anti-tit-for-tat remedies problems of tit-for-tat', ['Su Do Yi', 'Seung Ki Baek', 'Jung-Kyoo Choi'], u'2016-10-24', u"One of the most important questions in game theory concerns how mutual\ncooperation can be achieved and maintained in a social dilemma. In Axelrod's\ntournaments of the iterated prisoner's dilemma, Tit-for-Tat (TFT) demonstrated\nthe role of reciprocity in the emergence of cooperation. However, the stability\nof TFT does not hold in the presence of implementation error, and a TFT\npopulation is prone to neutral drift to unconditional cooperation, which\neventually invites defectors. We argue that a combination of TFT and anti-TFT\n(ATFT) overcomes these difficulties in a noisy environment, provided that ATFT\nis defined as choosing the opposite to the opponent's last move. According to\nthis TFT-ATFT strategy, a player normally uses TFT; turns to ATFT upon\nrecognizing his or her own error; returns to TFT either when mutual cooperation\nis recovered or when the opponent unilaterally defects twice in a row.

Our algorithm,\nGeographic Ancestry Positioning (GAP), relates local genetic distances between\nsamples to their spatial distances, and can be used for visually discerning\npopulation structure as well as accurately inferring the spatial origin of\nindividuals on a two-dimensional continuum. On both simulated and several real\ndatasets from diverse human populations, GAP exhibits substantially lower error\nin reconstructing spatial ancestry coordinates compared to PCA.\n  Our spatial inference algorithm can also be effectively applied to the\nproblem of population stratification in genome-wide association studies (GWAS),\nwhere hidden population structure can create fictitious associations when\npopulation ancestry is correlated with both the genotype and the trait.

Materials and methods: Aneurysmal SAH\ncases were collected retrospectively from the archives of 21 hospitals in\nMainland China. All the cases collected were from September 2016 and backward\nconsecutively for a period of time up to 8 years. SAH was initially diagnosed\nby brain computed tomography, and CT angiography (CTA) or digital subtraction\nangiography (DSA) was followed and SAH was confirmed to be due to cerebral\naneurysm.
