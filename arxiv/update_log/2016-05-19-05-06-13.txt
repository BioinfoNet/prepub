[u'Programmable Potentials: Approximate N-body potentials from coarse-level\n  logic', ['Gunjan S. Thakur', 'Ryan Mohr', 'Igor Mezic'], u'2016-04-30', u'This paper gives a systematic method for constructing an N-body potential,\napproximating the true potential, that accurately captures meso-scale behavior\nof the chemical or biological system using pairwise potentials coming from\nexperimental data or ab initio methods. The meso-scale behavior is translated\ninto logic rules for the dynamics. Each pairwise potential has an associated\nlogic function that is constructed using the logic rules, a class of elementary\nlogic functions, and AND, OR, and NOT gates. The effect of each logic function\nis to turn its associated potential on and off. The N-body potential is\nconstructed as linear combination of the pairwise potentials, where the\n"coefficients" of the potentials are smoothed versions of the associated logic\nfunctions. These potentials allow a potentially low-dimensional description of\ncomplex processes while still accurately capturing the relevant physics at the\nmeso-scale. We present the proposed formalism to construct coarse-grained\npotential models for three examples: an inhibitor molecular system, bond\nbreaking in chemical reactions, and DNA transcription from biology. The method\ncan potentially be used in reverse for design of molecular processes by\nspecifying properties of molecules that can carry them out.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05348v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]

[u'Variable Synaptic Strengths Controls the Firing Rate Distribution in\n  Feedforward Neural Networks', ['Cheng Ly', 'Gary Marsat'], u'2016-05-17', u'Heterogeneity of firing rate statistics is known to have severe consequences\non neural coding. We previously developed theoretical methods to understand how\ntwo attributes (synaptic and intrinsic heterogeneity) interact and alter the\nfiring rate distribution in a population of integrate-and-fire neurons with\nrandom recurrent coupling. Building upon those results, we adapt this framework\nand apply it to a delayed feedforward spiking network to demonstrate how these\nmodels can qualitatively capture the modulation of firing rate heterogeneity in\ndata from sensory neurons. Recent experimental recordings in weakly electric\nfish indicate that the distribution of superficial pyramidal cell firing rates\nin the electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL) depends on the stimulus, and also\nthat network inputs can mediate changes in this distribution. The developed\ntheory captures this data and specifically demonstrates how heterogeneous\nneural attributes alter firing rate heterogeneity, accounting for the effect\nwith various sensory stimuli. This leads to a prediction about how the strength\nof the effective network connectivity is related to intrinsic heterogeneity:\nthe strength of the delayed feedforward is positively correlated with\nexcitability (threshold value for spiking) with low firing rate heterogeneity\nand is negatively correlated with excitability with high firing rate\nheterogeneity. With computational models, we demonstrate that neural attributes\ndo not interact in a simple manner but rather in a complex stimulus-dependent\nfashion to control neural heterogeneity and to ultimately shape population\ncodes.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05335v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

Neher', 'Jan Albert'], u'2016-05-17', u'HIV-1 infection currently cannot be cured because the virus persists as\nintegrated proviral DNA in long-lived cells despite years of suppressive\nantiretroviral therapy (ART). To characterize establishment, turnover, and\nevolution of viral DNA reservoirs we deep-sequenced the p17gag region of the\nHIV-1 genome from samples obtained after 3-18 years of suppressive ART from 10\npatients. For each of these patients, whole genome deep-sequencing data of\nHIV-1 RNA populations before onset of ART were available from 6-12 longitudinal\nplasma samples spanning 5-8 years of untreated infection. This enabled a\ndetailed analysis of the dynamics and origin of proviral DNA during ART. A\nmedian of 14% (range 0-42%) of the p17gag DNA sequences were overtly defective\ndue to G-to-A hypermutation. The remaining sequences were remarkably similar to\npreviously observed RNA sequences and showed no evidence of evolution over many\nyears of suppressive ART. Most sequences from the DNA reservoirs were very\nsimilar to viruses actively replicating in plasma (RNA sequences) shortly\nbefore start of ART. The results do not support persistent HIV-1 replication as\na mechanism to maintain the HIV-1 reservoir during suppressive therapy. Rather,\nthe data indicate that viral DNA variants are turning over as long as patients\nare untreated and that suppressive ART halts this turnover.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05367v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

[u'A Precise Measure of Working Memory Reveals Subjects Difficulties\n  Managing Limited Capacity', ['Regina Ershova', 'Eugen Tarnow'], u'2016-04-07', u'Free recall consists of two separate stages: the emptying of working memory\nand reactivation [1]. The Tarnow Unchunkable Test (TUT, [2]) uses double\ninteger items to separate out only the first stage by making it difficult to\nreactivate items due to the lack of intra-item relationships. 193 Russian\ncollege students were tested via the internet version of the TUT. The average\nnumber of items remembered in the 3 item test was 2.54 items. In the 4 item\ntest, the average number of items decreased to 2.38. This, and a number of\nother qualitative distribution differences between the 3 and 4 item tests,\nindicates that the average capacity limit of working memory has been reached at\n3 items. This provides the first direct measurement of the unchunkable capacity\nlimit of language based items. That the average number of items remembered\ndecreased as the number of items increased from 3 to 4 indicates that most\nsubjects were unable to manage their working memories as the number of items\nincreased just beyond the average capacity. Further evidence for the difficulty\nin managing the capacity limit is that 25% of subjects could not remember any\nitems correctly at least in one of three 4 item tests and that the Pearson\ncorrelation between the 3 item and 4 item subject recalls was a relatively\nsmall 38%. This failure of managing a basic memory resource should have\nimportant consequences for pedagogy including instruction, text book design and\ntest design. Because working memory scores are important for academic\nachievement, it also suggests that an individual can gain academically by\nlearning how to manage her or his capacity limit.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05688v1', ['Other'], []]

[u'Free Recall Shows Similar Reactivation Behavior as Recognition & Cued\n  Recall', ['Eugen Tarnow'], u'2016-04-07', u'I find that the total retrieval time in word free recall increases linearly\nwith the total number of items recalled. Measured slopes, the time to retrieve\nan additional item, vary from 1.4-4.5 seconds per item depending upon\npresentation rate, subject age and whether there is a delay after list\npresentation or not. These times to retrieve an additional item obey a second\nlinear relationship as a function of the recall probability averaged over the\nexperiment, explicitly independent of subject age, presentation rate and\nwhether there is a delay after the list presentation or not. This second linear\nrelationship mimics the relationships in recognition and cued recall (Tarnow,\n2008) which suggests that free recall retrieval uses the same reactivation\nmechanism as recognition or cued recall. Extrapolation limits the time to\nretrieve an additional item to a maximum of 7.2 seconds per item if the\nprobability of recall is near 0%. Earlier upper limits for recognition and cued\nrecall varied with the item type between 0.2 and 1.8 seconds per item (Tarnow,\n2008). Implications include that there are only two types of short term memory:\nworking memory and reactivation.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05686v1', ['Other'], []]
[u'First direct evidence of two stages in free recall and three\n  corresponding estimates of working memory capacity', ['Eugen Tarnow'], u'2016-04-06', u'I find that exactly two stages can be seen directly in sequential free recall\ndistributions. These distributions show that the first three recalls come from\nthe emptying of working memory, recalls 6 and above come from a second stage\nand the 4th and 5th recalls are mixtures of the two. A discontinuity, a rounded\nstep function, is shown to exist in the fitted linear slope of the recall\ndistributions as the recall shifts from the emptying of working memory\n(positive slope) to the second stage (negative slope). The discontinuity leads\nto a first estimate of the capacity of working memory at 4-4.5 items. Working\nmemory accounts for the recency effect. The primacy effect comes from the\nsecond stage with a contribution also from working memory for short lists (the\nfirst item). The different slopes of the working memory and secondary stages,\nand that the two have different functional forms, accounts for the u-shaped\nserial position curve. The total recall is shown to be a linear combination of\nthe content of working memory and items recalled in the second stage with\n3.0-3.9 items coming from working memory, a second estimate of the capacity of\nworking memory. A third, separate upper limit on the capacity of working memory\nis found (3.06 items), corresponding to the requirement that the content of\nworking memory cannot exceed the total recall, item by item. This third limit\npresumably corresponds to the least chunked item. This is the best limit on the\ncapacity of unchunked working memory.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05685v1', ['Other'], []]
[u'Conditional Response Probabilities Confirm Two Stages of Free Recall,\n  Working Memory Very Localized, Second Stage Delocalized, Both with Strong\n  Tendencies to Forward Subsequent Recalls', ['Eugen Tarnow'], u'2016-04-04', u"Recently it was shown that free recall consists of two stages: the first few\nrecalls empty working memory and a second stage concludes the recall (Tarnow,\n2015; for a review of the theoretical prediction see Murdock, 1974). Here I\ninvestigate conditional response probabilities in Murdock's 40-1 (1962) free\nrecall dataset. I find that the conditional response probabilities confirm the\npresence of two stages. The first stage is characterized by a large enhancement\nof the forward subsequent recall (up to 30 times chance) and a large\nsuppression of backward recalls (up to 26 times smaller than chance for recalls\nbetween 10 and 40 items away). The second stage forward subsequent recall is\nenhanced by a factor of 5 and the probability of backward and forward recalls\nare concentrated at small distances. Thus both stages favor forward subsequent\nrecalls. As in Tarnow (2015), the first stage is much more localized than the\nsecond stage. Working memory capacity is estimated in six ways to be about 4.5\nword items for the 40-1 word list.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05684v1', ['Other'], []]

When fully expanding the x-axis and\nexamining the conditional response probabilities separately for the beginning,\nmiddle and end of the presented item list, I show that the law of contiguity\napplies only locally, even then only sometimes, and breaks down globally.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05681v1', ['Other'], []]

[u'Parameter inference method for stochastic single-cell dynamics from\n  tree-structured data', ['Irena Kuzmanovska', 'Andreas Milias-Argeitis', 'Christoph Zechner', 'Mustafa Khammash'], u'2016-05-18', u'With the advance of experimental techniques such as time-lapse fluorescence\nmicroscopy, the availability of single-cell trajectory data has vastly\nincreased, and so has the demand for computational methods suitable for\nparameter inference with this type of data. However, most of the currently\navailable methods treat single-cell trajectories independently, ignoring the\nmother-daughter relationships and the information provided by population\nstructure. This information is however essential if a process of interest\nhappens at cell division, or if it evolves slowly compared to the duration of\nthe cell cycle. In this work, we highlight the importance of tracking cell\nlineage trees and propose a Bayesian framework for parameter inference on\ntree-structured data. Our method relies on a combination of Sequential Monte\nCarlo for likelihood approximation and Markov Chain Monte Carlo for parameter\nsampling. We demonstrate the capabilities of our inference framework on two\nsimple examples in which the lineage tree information is necessary: one in\nwhich the cell phenotype can only switch at cell division and another where the\ncell type fluctuates randomly over timescales that extend well beyond the\nlifetime of a single cell.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05517v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]

[u'Intrinsic noise profoundly alters the dynamics and steady state of\n  morphogen-controlled bistable genetic switches', ['Ruben Perez-Carrasco', 'Pilar Guerrero', 'James Briscoe', 'Karen Page'], u'2016-05-18', u'During tissue development, patterns of gene expression determine the spatial\narrangement of cell types. In many cases, gradients of secreted signaling\nmolecules - morphogens - guide this process. The continuous positional\ninformation provided by the gradient is converted into discrete cell types by\nthe downstream transcriptional network that responds to the morphogen. A\nmechanism commonly used to implement a sharp transition between two adjacent\ncell fates is the genetic toggle switch, composed of cross-repressing\ntranscriptional determinants. Previous analyses emphasize the steady state\noutput of these mechanisms. Here, we explore the dynamics of the toggle switch\nand use exact numerical simulations of the kinetic reactions, the Chemical\nLangevin Equation, and Minimum Action Path theory to establish a framework for\nstudying the effect of gene expression noise on patterning time and boundary\nposition. This provides insight into the time scale, gene expression\ntrajectories and directionality of stochastic switching events between cell\nstates. Taking gene expression noise into account predicts that the final\nboundary position of a morphogen-induced toggle switch, although robust to\nchanges in the details of the noise, is distinct from that of the deterministic\nsystem. Moreover, stochastic switching introduces differences in patterning\ntime along the morphogen gradient that result in a patterning wave propagating\naway from the morphogen source. The velocity of this wave is influenced by\nnoise; the wave sharpens and slows as it advances and may never reach steady\nstate in a biologically relevant time. This could explain experimentally\nobserved dynamics of pattern formation. Together the analysis reveals the\nimportance of dynamical transients for understanding morphogen-driven\ntranscriptional networks and indicates that gene expression noise can\nqualitatively alter developmental patterning.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05587v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
[u'Identification of conserved moieties in metabolic networks by graph\n  theoretical analysis of atom transition networks', ['Hulda S. Haraldsdottir', 'Ronan M. T. Fleming'], u'2016-05-17', u'Conserved moieties are groups of atoms that remain intact in all reactions of\na metabolic network. Identification of conserved moieties gives insight into\nthe structure and function of metabolic networks and facilitates metabolic\nmodelling. All moiety conservation relations can be represented as nonnegative\ninteger vectors in the left null space of the stoichiometric matrix\ncorresponding to a biochemical network. Algorithms exist to compute such\nvectors based only on reaction stoichiometry but their computational complexity\nhas limited their application to relatively small metabolic networks. Moreover,\nthe vectors returned by existing algorithms do not, in general, represent\nconservation of a specific moiety with a defined atomic structure. Here, we\nshow that identification of conserved moieties requires data on reaction atom\nmappings in addition to stoichiometry. We present a novel method to identify\nconserved moieties in metabolic networks by graph theoretical analysis of their\nunderlying atom transition networks. Our method returns the exact group of\natoms belonging to each conserved moiety as well as the corresponding vector in\nthe left null space of the stoichiometric matrix. It can be implemented as a\npipeline of polynomial time algorithms. Our implementation completes in under\nfive minutes on a metabolic network with more than 4,000 mass balanced\nreactions. The scalability of the method enables extension of existing\napplications for moiety conservation relations to genome-scale metabolic\nnetworks.
