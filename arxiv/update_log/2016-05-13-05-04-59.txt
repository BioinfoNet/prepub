[u'Estimating the dimensionality of neural responses with fMRI Repetition\n  Suppression', ['Mattia Rigotti', 'Stefano Fusi'], u'2016-05-12', u"We propose a novel method that exploits fMRI Repetition Suppression (RS-fMRI)\nto measure the dimensionality of the set response vectors, i.e. the dimension\nof the space of linear combinations of neural population activity patterns in\nresponse to specific task conditions. RS-fMRI measures the overlap between\nresponse vectors even in brain areas displaying no discernible average\ndifferential BOLD signal. We show how this property can be used to estimate the\nneural response dimensionality in areas lacking macroscopic spatial patterning.\nThe importance of dimensionality derives from how it relates to a neural\ncircuit's functionality. As we show, the dimensionality of the response vectors\nis predicted to be high in areas involved in multi-stream integration, while it\nis low in areas where inputs from independent sources do not interact or merely\noverlap linearly. Our method can be used to identify and functionally\ncharacterize cortical circuits that integrate multiple independent information\npathways.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03952v1', ['Neurons and Cognition', 'Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Predictability and hierarchy in Drosophila behavior', ['Gordon J. Berman', 'William Bialek', 'Joshua W. Shaevitz'], u'2016-05-11', u"Even the simplest of animals exhibit behavioral sequences with complex\ntemporal dynamics. Prominent amongst the proposed organizing principles for\nthese dynamics has been the idea of a hierarchy, wherein the movements an\nanimal makes can be understood as a set of nested sub-clusters. Although this\ntype of organization holds potential advantages in terms of motion control and\nneural circuitry, measurements demonstrating this for an animal's entire\nbehavioral repertoire have been limited in scope and temporal complexity. Here,\nwe use a recently developed unsupervised technique to discover and track the\noccurrence of all stereotyped behaviors performed by fruit flies moving in a\nshallow arena. Calculating the optimally predictive representation of the fly's\nfuture behaviors, we show that fly behavior exhibits multiple time scales and\nis organized into a hierarchical structure that is indicative of its underlying\nbehavioral programs and its changing internal states.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03626v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Dynamics of epidemic spreading with vaccination: impact of social\n  pressure and engagement', ['Marcelo A. Pires', 'Nuno Crokidakis'], u'2016-05-12', u'In this work we consider a model of epidemic spreading coupled with an\nopinion dynamics in a fully-connected population. Regarding the opinion\ndynamics, the individuals may be in two distinct states, namely in favor or\nagainst a vaccination campaign. Individuals against the vaccination follow a\nstandard SIS model, whereas the pro-vaccine individuals can also be in a third\ncompartment, namely Vaccinated. In addition, the opinions change according to\nthe majority-rule dynamics in groups with three individuals. We also consider\nthat the vaccine can give permanent or temporary immunization to the\nindividuals. By means of analytical calculations and computer simulations, we\nshow that the opinion dynamics can drastically affect the disease propagation,\nand that the engagement of the pro-vaccine individuals can be crucial for\nstopping the epidemic spreading.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03914v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Does Antibiotic Resistance Evolve in Hospitals?', ['Anna Seigal', 'Portia Mira', 'Bernd Sturmfels', 'Miriam Barlow'], u'2016-05-12', u'Nosocomial outbreaks of bacteria have been documented many times. Based on\nthese incidents, and the heavy usage of antibiotics in hospitals, it has been\nassumed that antibiotic resistance evolves in hospital environments. To test\nthis assumption, we analyzed the resistance phenotypes of bacteria collected at\na community hospital over a 2.5-year period. To assess dependence on variables\nother than time, we performed a graphical model analysis. We found no\nassociation between resistance and other patient data (age, gender, infectious\nspecies, and sample type). We created a Markov model for evolution of\nresistance in the hospital and performed a hypothesis test for each of the 16\nantibiotics in the study. We found that the hospital environment has a\nsignificant effect upon evolution of resistance to Cefepime and Ceftazidime but\nthat, for the other antibiotics tested, the hospital is merely a piece of the\nlarger picture. We call this method Nosocomial Evolution of Resistance Detector\n(NERD). While sensitive enough to detect subtle resistance trends that can\ninform hospital staff about the effects of various practices and interventions\non the occurrence of resistance, it can also be used to help detect clonal\noutbreaks and is available free of charge.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03660v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Simultaneous identification of specifically interacting paralogs and\n  inter-protein contacts by Direct-Coupling Analysis', ['Thomas Gueudre', 'Carlo Baldassi', 'Marco Zamparo', 'Martin Weigt', 'Andrea Pagnani'], u'2016-05-12', u'Understanding protein-protein interactions is central to our understanding of\nalmost all complex biological processes. Computational tools exploiting rapidly\ngrowing genomic databases to characterize protein-protein interactions are\nurgently needed. Such methods should connect multiple scales from evolutionary\nconserved interactions between families of homologous proteins, over the\nidentification of specifically interacting proteins in the case of multiple\nparalogs inside a species, down to the prediction of residues being in physical\ncontact across interaction interfaces. Statistical inference methods detecting\nresidue-residue coevolution have recently triggered considerable progress in\nusing sequence data for quaternary protein structure prediction; they require,\nhowever, large joint alignments of homologous protein pairs known to interact.\nThe generation of such alignments is a complex computational task on its own;\napplication of coevolutionary modeling has in turn been restricted to proteins\nwithout paralogs, or to bacterial systems with the corresponding coding genes\nbeing co-localized in operons. Here we show that the Direct-Coupling Analysis\nof residue coevolution can be extended to connect the different scales, and\nsimultaneously to match interacting paralogs, to identify inter-protein\nresidue-residue contacts and to discriminate interacting from noninteracting\nfamilies in a multiprotein system. Our results extend the potential\napplications of coevolutionary analysis far beyond cases treatable so far.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03745v1', ['Quantitative Methods', 'Molecular Networks'], []]
[u'pSpatiocyte: A Parallel Stochastic Method for Particle\n  Reaction-Diffusion Systems', ['Atsushi Miyauchi', 'Kazunari Iwamoto', 'Satya Nanda Vel Arjunan', 'Koichi Takahashi'], u'2016-05-12', u"Computational systems biology has provided plenty of insights into cell\nbiology. Early on, the focus was on reaction networks between molecular\nspecies. Spatial distribution only began to be considered mostly within the\nlast decade. However, calculations were restricted to small systems because of\ntremendously high computational workloads. To date, application to the cell of\ntypical size with molecular resolution is still far from realization. In this\narticle, we present a new parallel stochastic method for particle\nreaction-diffusion systems. The program called pSpatiocyte was created bearing\nin mind reaction networks in biological cells operating in crowded\nintracellular environments as the primary simulation target. pSpatiocyte\nemploys unique discretization and parallelization algorithms based on a\nhexagonal close-packed lattice for efficient execution particularly on large\ndistributed memory parallel computers. For two-level parallelization, we\nintroduced isolated subdomain and tri-stage lockstep communication for\nprocess-level, and voxel-locking techniques for thread-level. We performed a\nseries of parallel runs on RIKEN's K computer. For a fine lattice that had\nrelatively low occupancy, pSpatiocyte achieved 7686 times speedup with 663552\ncores relative to 64 cores from the viewpoint of strong scaling and exhibited\n74\\% parallel efficiency. As for weak scaling, efficiencies at least 60% were\nobserved up to 663552 cores. In addition to computational performance,\ndiffusion and reaction rates were validated by theory and another\nwell-validated program and had good agreement. Lastly, as a preliminary example\nof real-world applications, we present a calculation of the MAPK model, a\ntypical reaction network motif in cell signaling pathways.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03726v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Autocatalytic sets in polymer networks with variable catalysis\n  distributions', ['Wim Hordijk', 'Mike Steel'], u'2016-05-12', u"All living systems -- from the origin of life to modern cells -- rely on a\nset of biochemical reactions that are simultaneously self-sustaining and\nautocatalytic. This notion of an autocatalytic set has been formalized\ngraph-theoretically (as `RAF'), leading to mathematical results and\npolynomial-time algorithms that have been applied to simulated and real\nchemical reaction systems. In this paper, we investigate the emergence of\nautocatalytic sets in polymer models when the catalysis rate of each molecule\ntype is drawn from some probability distribution. We show that although the\naverage catalysis rate $f$ for RAFs to arise depends on this distribution, a\nuniversal linear upper and lower bound for $f$ (with increasing system size)\nstill applies. However, the probability of the appearance (and size) of\nautocatalytic sets can vary widely, depending on the particular catalysis\ndistribution. We use simulations to explore how tight the mathematical bounds\nare, and the reasons for the observed variations. We also investigate the\nimpact of inhibition (where molecules can also inhibit reactions) on the\nemergence of autocatalytic sets, deriving new mathematical and algorithmic\nresults.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03919v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
