[u'Random Search with Memory in Patchy Media: Exploration-Exploitation\n  Tradeoff', ['M. Chupeau', 'O. Benichou', 'S. Redner'], u'2016-09-16', u'How to best exploit patchy resources? This long-standing question belongs to\nthe extensively studied class of explore/exploit problems that arise in a wide\nrange of situations, from animal foraging, to robotic exploration, and to human\ndecision processes. Despite its broad relevance, the issue of optimal\nexploitation has previously only been tackled through two paradigmatic limiting\nmodels---patch-use and random search---that do not account for the interplay\nbetween searcher motion within patches and resource depletion. Here, we bridge\nthis gap by introducing a minimal patch exploitation model that incorporates\nthis coupling: the searcher depletes the resources along its random-walk\ntrajectory within a patch and travels to a new patch after it takes\n$\\mathcal{S}$ consecutive steps without finding resources. We compute the\ndistribution of the amount of resources $F_t$ consumed by time $t$ for this\nnon-Markovian random walker and show that exploring multiple patches is\nbeneficial. In one dimension, we analytically derive the optimal strategy to\nmaximize $F_t$. We show that this strategy is robust with respect to the\ndistribution of resources within patches and the criterion for leaving a given\npatch. We also show that $F_t$ can be optimized in the ecologically-relevant\ncase of two-dimensional patchy environments.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05151v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Single variant bottleneck in the early dynamics of H. influenzae\n  bacteremia in neonatal rats questions the theory of independent action', ['Xinxian Shao', 'Bruce R. Levin', 'Ilya Nemenman'], u'2016-09-15', u"There is an abundance of information about the genetic basis, physiological\nand molecular mechanisms of bacterial pathogenesis. In contrast, relatively\nlittle is known about population dynamic processes, by which bacteria colonize\nhosts and invade tissues and cells and thereby cause disease. In an article\npublished in 1978, Moxon and Murphy presented evidence that, when inoculated\nintranasally with a mixture streptomycin sensitive and resistant (Sm$^S$ and\nSm$^R$) and otherwise isogenic stains of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib),\nneonatal rats develop a bacteremic infection that often is dominated by only\none strain, Sm$^S$ or Sm$^R$. After rulling out other possibilities through\nyears of related experiments, the field seems to have settled on a plausible\nexplanation for this phenomenon: the first bacterium to invade the host\nactivates the host immune response that `shuts the door' on the second invading\nstrain. To explore this hypothesis in a necessarily quantitative way, we\nmodeled this process with a set of mixed stochastic and deterministic\ndifferential equations. Our analysis of the properties of this model with\nrealistic parameters suggests that this hypothesis cannot explain the\nexperimental results of Moxon and Murphy, and in particular the observed\nrelationship between the frequency of different types of blood infections\n(bacteremias) and the inoculum size. We propose modifications to the model that\ncome closer to explaining these data. However, the modified and better fitting\nmodel contradicts the common theory of independent action of individual\nbacteria in establishing infections. We discuss the implications of these\nresults.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04856v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

Oladejo', 'Ali Onuche John'], u'2016-09-10', u'HIV is a deadly virus transmitted either through having of unprotected sex,\nmother to child transmission, sharing of unsterilized objects that is capable\nof making cut or wounds on the body, through blood or bodily fluid\ntransmission. AIDS has no permanent cure but remedies that help in suppressing\nthe power effect of the virus are available. Previous studies has shown that\nthe epidemic claimed more lives via vertical transmission, mother-to-child\ntransmission, blood transfusion, sexual intercourse and injection drug users.\nThe associated models were derived using diagnosis and treatments records of\nconfirmed status of HIV/AIDS clients. A new model analysis were proposed that\ncould handle cases of HIV/AIDS routes of transmission and treatments via\nvertical, mother-to-child, blood transfusion, sexual intercourse, injection\ndrug users that were not considered in previous studies. The new model was\nsolved using Fractional Differential Transformation by Caputo sense algorithm.\nThe new model is a major contribution for optimal assessment, monitoring,\nevaluation, control and management of HIV/AIDS, with 75% accuracy.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05051v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

Mean age across the individual studies varied\nbetween 58 and 69 years. The proportion of women enrolled ranged from 10% to\n30%. Across 6 available studies, women had a significantly lower risk of first\nappropriate shock compared with men (pooled multivariable adjusted hazard ratio\n0.62 (95% CI [0.44; 0.88]). Across 14 studies reporting multivariable adjusted\ngender-specific hazard ratio estimates for all-cause mortality, women had a\nlower risk of death than men (pooled hazard ratio 0.75 (95% CI [0.66; 0.86]).\nThere was no statistically significant difference for the incidence of first\ninappropriate shocks (3 studies, pooled hazard ratio 0.99 (95% CI [0.56;\n1.73]).\n  CONCLUSION: In this large contemporary meta-analysis, women had a\nsignificantly lower risk of appropriate shocks and death than men, but a\nsimilar risk of inappropriate shocks.

[u'Generalized Plasma Skimming Model for Cells and Drug Carriers in the\n  Microvasculature', ['Tae-Rin Lee', 'Sung Sic Yoo', 'Jiho Yang'], u'2016-09-16', u"In microvascular transport, where both blood and drug carriers are involved,\nplasma skimming has a key role on changing hematocrit level and drug carrier\nconcentration in capillary beds after continuous vessel bifurcation in the\nmicrovasculature. While there have been numerous studies on modeling the plasma\nskimming of blood, previous works lacked in consideration of its interaction\nwith drug carriers. In this paper, a generalized plasma skimming model is\nsuggested to predict the redistributions of both the cells and drug carriers at\neach bifurcation. In order to examine its applicability, this new model was\napplied on a single bifurcation system to predict the redistribution of red\nblood cells and drug carriers. Furthermore, this model was tested at\nmicrovascular network level under different plasma skimming conditions for\npredicting the concentration of drug carriers. Based on these results, the\napplicability of this generalized plasma skimming model is fully discussed and\nfuture works along with the model's limitations are summarized.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04973v1', ['Tissues and Organs'], []]

Due to the complexity of the model, the large\nnumber of parameters, and the inherent uncertainty of the experimental data, we\nutilize Monte Carlo sampling to study the model's behavior under a wide range\nof parameter values and to compute first- and total-order sensitivity indices.\nCharacteristically, at elevated arterial blood pressure, the model predicts\ncases with increased or reduced interstitial pressure.

[u'A Calvin bestiary', ['Alan D. Rendall'], u'2016-09-16', u'This paper compares a number of mathematical models for the Calvin cycle of\nphotosynthesis and presents theorems on the existence and stability of steady\nstates of these models. Results on five-variable models in the literature are\nsurveyed. Next a number of larger models related to one introduced by\nPettersson and Ryde-Pettersson are discussed. The mathematical nature of this\nmodel is clarified, showing that it is naturally defined as a system of\ndifferential-algebraic equations. It is proved that there are choices of\nparameters for which this model admits more than one positive steady state.\nThis is done by analysing the limit where the storage of sugars from the cycle\nas starch is shut down. There is also a discussion of the minimal models for\nthe cycle due to Hahn.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04926v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
[u'A Quadratically Regularized Functional Canonical Correlation Analysis\n  for Identifying the Global Structure of Pleiotropy with NGS Data', ['Nan Lin', 'Yun Zhu', 'Ruzong Fan', 'Momiao Xiong'], u'2016-09-16', u'Investigating the pleiotropic effects of genetic variants can increase\nstatistical power, provide important information to achieve deep understanding\nof the complex genetic structures of disease, and offer powerful tools for\ndesigning effective treatments with fewer side effects. However, the current\nmultiple phenotype association analysis paradigm lacks breadth (number of\nphenotypes and genetic variants jointly analyzed at the same time) and depth\n(hierarchical structure of phenotype and genotypes). A key issue for high\ndimensional pleiotropic analysis is to effectively extract informative internal\nrepresentation and features from high dimensional genotype and phenotype data.\nTo explore multiple levels of representations of genetic variants, learn their\ninternal patterns involved in the disease development, and overcome critical\nbarriers in advancing the development of novel statistical methods and\ncomputational algorithms for genetic pleiotropic analysis, we proposed a new\nframework referred to as a quadratically regularized functional CCA (QRFCCA)\nfor association analysis which combines three approaches: (1) quadratically\nregularized matrix factorization, (2) functional data analysis and (3)\ncanonical correlation analysis (CCA). Large-scale simulations show that the\nQRFCCA has a much higher power than that of the nine competing statistics while\nretaining the appropriate type 1 errors. To further evaluate performance, the\nQRFCCA and nine other statistics are applied to the whole genome sequencing\ndataset from the TwinsUK study. We identify a total of 79 genes with rare\nvariants and 67 genes with common variants significantly associated with the 46\ntraits using QRFCCA. The results show that the QRFCCA substantially outperforms\nthe nine other statistics.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04902v1', ['Genomics'], []]
