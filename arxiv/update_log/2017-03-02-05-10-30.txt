[u'New Empirical Evidence on Disjunction Effect and Cultural Dependence', ['Indranil Mukhopadhyay', 'Nithin Nagaraj', 'Sisir Roy'], u'2017-03-01', u'We perform new experiment using almost the same sample size considered by Tversky and Shafir to test the validity of classical probability theory in decision making. The results clearly indicate that the disjunction effect depends also on culture and more specifically on gender (females rather than males). We did more statistical analysis rather that putting the actual values done by previous authors. We propose different kind of disjunction effect i.e. strong and weak based on our statistical analysis.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00223v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Semi-analytical approximations to statistical moments of sigmoid and softmax mappings of normal variables', ['Jean Daunizeau'], u'2017-03-01', u'This note is concerned with accurate and computationally efficient approximations of moments of Gaussian random variables passed through sigmoid or softmax mappings. These approximations are semi-analytical (i.e. they involve the numerical adjustment of parametric forms) and highly accurate (they yield 5% error at most). We also highlight a few niche applications of these approximations, which arise in the context of, e.g., drift-diffusion models of decision making or non-parametric data clustering approaches. We provide these as examples of efficient alternatives to more tedious derivations that would be needed if one was to approach the underlying mathematical issues in a more formal way. We hope that this technical note will be helpful to modellers facing similar mathematical issues, although maybe stemming from different academic prospects.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00091v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'The impact of species-neutral stage structure on macroecological patterns', ["Rafael D'Andrea", "James P. O'Dwyer"], u'2017-03-01', u'Despite its radical assumption of ecological equivalence between species, neutral biodiversity theory can often provide good fits to species abundance distributions observed in nature. Major criticisms of neutral theory have focused on interspecific differences, which are in conflict with ecological equivalence. However, individual-level neutrality in nature is also broken by differences between conspecific individuals at different life stages, which in many communities may vastly exceed interspecific differences between individuals at similar stages. These individual-level asymmetries have not been fully explored in species-neutral models, and it is not known whether demographic stage structure affects macroecological patterns in neutral theory. Here we present a two-stage neutral model, where both fecundity and mortality are allowed to change as an individual moves from a stage to the other. We explore qualitatively different scenarios, and compare numerically obtained species abundance distributions to the predictions of unstructured neutral theory. We find that abundance distributions are robust to this kind of stage structure, but only so long as subpopulations at different stages fluctuate in synchrony. On the other hand, species abundance distributions can differ significantly from the unstructured case if adults have sufficiently low fecundity and mortality. In addition, we show that the cumulative number of births per species, which is distributed as a power law with a 3/2 exponent, is invariant even when the SAD departs from unstructured model predictions. Our findings potentially explain power law-like abundance distributions in systems with strong demographic structure, such as eusocial insects and human given names, and may partially rehabilitate species abundance distributions from past criticisms as to their inability to distinguish between biological mechanisms.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00389v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'How does geographical distance translate into genetic distance?', ['Veronica Miro Pina', 'Emmanuel Schertzer'], u'2017-03-01', u'Geographic structure can affect patterns of genetic differentiation and speciation rates. In this article, we investigate the dynamics of genetic distances in a geographically structured metapopulation. We model the metapopulation as a weighted directed graph, with N vertices corresponding to N homogeneous subpopulations. The dynamics of the genetic distances is then controlled by two types of transitions -mutation and migration events between islands. Under a large population-long chromosome limit, we show that the genetic distance between two subpopulations converges to a deterministic quantity that can asymptotically be expressed in terms of the hitting time between two random walks in the metapopulation graph. Our result shows that the genetic distance between two subpopulations does not only depend on the direct migration rates between them but on the whole metapopulation structure.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00357v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Population dynamics of immune repertoires', ['Jonathan Desponds', 'Andreas Mayer', 'Thierry Mora', 'Aleksandra M. Walczak'], u'2017-03-01', u'The evolution of the adaptive immune system is characterized by changes in the relative abundances of the B- and T-cell clones that make up its repertoires. To fully capture this evolution, we need to describe the complex dynamics of the response to pathogenic and self-antigenic stimulations, as well as the statistics of novel lymphocyte receptors introduced throughout life. Recent experiments, ranging from high-throughput immune repertoire sequencing to quantification of the response to specific antigens, can help us characterize the effective dynamics of the immune response. Here we describe mathematical models informed by experiments that lead to a picture of clonal competition in a highly stochastic context. We discuss how different types of competition, noise and selection shape the observed clone-size distributions, and contrast them with predictions of a neutral theory of clonal evolution. These mathematical models show that memory and effector immune repertoire evolution is far from neutral, and is driven by the history of the pathogenic environment, while naive repertoire dynamics are consistent with neutral theory and competition in a fixed antigenic environment. Lastly, we investigate the effect of long-term clonal selection on repertoire aging.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00226v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'The ordered independent loss model for the evolution of CRISPR spacers', ['Franz Baumdicker', 'Ariana M. I. Huebner', 'Peter Pfaffelhuber'], u'2017-03-01', u'Today, the CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) region within bacterial and archaeal genomes is known to encode an adaptive immune system. We rely on previous results on the evolution of the CRISPR arrays, which led to the ordered independent loss model, introduced by Kupczok and Bollback (2013). When focusing on the spacers (between the repeats), new elements enter a CRISPR array at rate $\\theta/2$ at the leader end of the array, while all spacers present are lost at rate $\\rho/2$ along the phylogeny relating the sample. Within this model, we compute the distribution of distances of spacers which are present in all arrays in samples of size $n=2$ and $n=3$. We use these results to estimate the loss rate $\\rho$ from spacer array data.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00220v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

Results obtained for E. coli and human cells are consistent with experiments and point to different regulatory strategies by which growth can be fostered or repressed. Moreover we explicitly connect the `inverse temperature' that controls MaxEnt distributions to the growth dynamics, showing that the initial size of a colony may be crucial in determining how an exponentially growing population organizes the phenotypic space.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00219v1', ['Populations and Evolution', 'Quantitative Methods', 'Molecular Networks'], []]
[u'Stochastic and Information-thermodynamic Structures of Population Dynamics in Fluctuating Environment', ['Tetsuya J. Kobayashi', 'Yuki Sughiyama'], u'2017-03-01', u'Adaptation in a fluctuating environment is a process of fueling information about environment to gain fitness. Living systems have gradually developed strategies for adaptation from random and passive diversification of the phenotype to more proactive decision making, in which environmental information is sensed and exploited more actively and effectively. Understanding the fundamental relation between fitness and information is therefore crucial to clarify the limits and universal properties of adaptation. In this work, we elucidate the underlying stochastic and information-thermodynamic structure in this process, by deriving causal fluctuation relations (FRs) of fitness and information. Combined with a duality between phenotypic and environmental dynamics, the FRs reveal the limit of fitness gain, the relation of time reversibility with the achievability of the limit, and the possibility and condition for gaining excess fitness due to environmental fluctuation. The loss of fitness due to causal constraints and the limited capacity of real organisms is shown to be the difference between time-forward and time-backward path probabilities of phenotypic and environmental dynamics. Furthermore, the FRs generalize the concept of evolutionary stable state (ESS) for fluctuating environment by giving the probability that the optimal strategy on average can be invaded by a suboptimal one owing to rare environmental fluctuation. These results clarify the information thermodynamic structures in adaptation and evolution.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00125v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
