[u'Dynamical signatures of structural connectivity damage to a model of the\n  brain posed at criticality', ['Ariel Haimovici', 'Pablo Balenzuela', 'Enzo Tagliazucchi'], u'2016-11-09', u'Synchronization of brain activity fluctuations is believed to represent\ncommunication between spatially distant neural processes. These inter-areal\nfunctional interactions develop in the background of a complex network of\naxonal connections linking cortical and sub-cortical neurons, termed the human\n"structural connectome". Theoretical considerations and experimental evidence\nsupport the view that the human brain can be modeled as a system operating at a\ncritical point between ordered (sub-critical) and disordered (super-critical)\nphases. Here, we explore the hypothesis that pathologies resulting from brain\ninjury of different etiology are related to the model of a critical brain. For\nthis purpose, we investigate how damage to the integrity of the structural\nconnectome impacts on the signatures of critical dynamics. Adopting a hybrid\nmodeling approach combining an empirical weighted network of human structural\nconnections with a conceptual model of critical dynamics, we show that lesions\nlocated at highly transited connections progressively displace the model\ntowards the sub-critical regime. The topological properties of the nodes and\nlinks are of less importance when considered independently of their weight in\nthe network. We observe that damage to midline hubs such as the middle and\nposterior cingulate cortex is most crucial for the disruption of criticality in\nthe model. However, a similar effect can be achieved by targeting less\ntransited nodes and links whose connection weights add up to an equivalent\namount. This implies that brain pathology does not necessarily arise due to\ninsult targeted at well-connected areas and that inter- subject variability\ncould obscure lesions located at non-hub regions. Finally, we discuss the\npredictions of our model in the context of clinical studies of traumatic brain\ninjury and neurodegenerative disorders.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03026v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Human mobility networks and persistence of rapidly mutating pathogens', ['Alberto Aleta', 'Andreia N. S. Hisi', 'Sandro Meloni', 'Chiara Poletto', 'Vittoria Colizza', 'Yamir Moreno'], u'2016-11-08', u"Rapidly mutating pathogens may be able to persist in the population and reach\nan endemic equilibrium by escaping hosts' acquired immunity. For such diseases,\nmultiple biological, environmental and population-level mechanisms determine\nthe dynamics of the outbreak, including pathogen's epidemiological traits (e.g.\ntransmissibility, infectious period and duration of immunity), seasonality,\ninteraction with other circulating strains and hosts' mixing and spatial\nfragmentation. Here, we study a susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible\nmodel on a metapopulation where individuals are distributed in subpopulations\nconnected via a network of mobility flows. Through extensive numerical\nsimulations, we explore the phase space of pathogen's persistence and map the\ndynamical regimes of the pathogen following emergence. Our results show that\nspatial fragmentation and mobility play a key role in the persistence of the\ndisease whose maximum is reached at intermediate mobility values. We describe\nthe occurrence of different phenomena including local extinction and emergence\nof epidemic waves, and assess the conditions for large scale spreading.\nFindings are highlighted in reference to previous works and to real scenarios.\nOur work uncovers the crucial role of hosts' mobility on the ecological\ndynamics of rapidly mutating pathogens, opening the path for further studies on\ndisease ecology in the presence of a complex and heterogeneous environment.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02768v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Low pH, high salinity: too much for Microbial Fuel Cells?', ['Nicole Jannelli', 'Rosa Anna Nastro', 'Viviana Cigolotti', 'Mariagiovanna Minutillo', 'Giacomo Falcucci'], u'2016-11-04', u'Twelve single chambered, air-cathode Tubular Microbial Fuel Cells (TMFCs)\nhave been filled up with fruit and vegetable residues. The anodes were realized\nby means of a carbon fiber brush, while the cathodes were realized through a\ngraphite-based porous ceramic disk with Nafion membranes (117 Dupont). The\nperformances in terms of polarization curves and power production were assessed\naccording to different operating conditions: percentage of solid substrate\nwater dilution, adoption of freshwater and a 35mg/L NaCl water solution and,\nfinally, the effect of an initial potentiostatic growth.\n  All TMFCs operated at low pH (pH$=3.0 \\pm 0.5$), as no pH amendment was\ncarried out. Despite the harsh environmental conditions, our TMFCs showed a\nPower Density (PD) ranging from 20 to 55~mW/m$^2 \\cdot$kg$_{\\text{waste}}$ and\na maximum CD of 20~mA/m$^2 \\cdot$kg$_{\\text{waste}}$, referred to the cathodic\nsurface. COD removal after a $28-$day period was about $45 \\%$.\n  The remarkably low pH values as well as the fouling of Nafion membrane very\nlikely limited TMFC performances. However, a scale-up estimation of our\nreactors provides interesting values in terms of power production, compared to\nactual anaerobic digestion plants. These results encourage further studies to\ncharacterize the graphite-based porous ceramic cathodes and to optimize the\nglobal TMFC performances, as they may provide a valid and sustainable\nalternative to anaerobic digestion technologies.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02735v1', ['Other'], []]
[u'Heter-LP: A heterogeneous label propagation algorithm and its\n  application in drug repositioning', ['Maryam Lotfi Shahreza', 'Nasser Ghadiri', 'Seyed Rasul Mossavi', 'Jaleh Varshosaz', 'James Green'], u'2016-11-08', u'Drug repositioning offers an effective solution to drug discovery, saving\nboth time and resources by finding new indications for existing drugs.\nTypically, a drug takes effect via its protein targets in the cell. As a\nresult, it is necessary for drug development studies to conduct an\ninvestigation into the interrelationships of drugs, protein targets, and\ndiseases. Although previous studies have made a strong case for the\neffectiveness of integrative network-based methods for predicting these\ninterrelationships, little progress has been achieved in this regard within\ndrug repositioning research. Moreover, the interactions of new drugs and\ntargets (lacking any known targets and drugs, respectively) cannot be\naccurately predicted by most established methods. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel semi-supervised heterogeneous label propagation algorithm named Heter-LP,\nwhich applies both local as well as global network features for data\nintegration. To predict drug-target, disease-target, and drug-disease\nassociations, we use information about drugs, diseases, and targets as\ncollected from multiple sources at different levels. Our algorithm integrates\nthese various types of data into a heterogeneous network and implements a label\npropagation algorithm to find new interactions. Statistical analyses of 10-fold\ncross-validation results and experimental analysis support the effectiveness of\nthe proposed algorithm.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02945v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Sensitivity of small myosin II ensembles from different isoforms to\n  mechanical load and ATP concentration', ['Thorsten Erdmann', 'Kathrin Bartelheimer', 'Ulrich S. Schwarz'], u'2016-11-09', u'Based on a detailed crossbridge model for individual myosin II motors, we\nsystematically study the influence of mechanical load and adenosine\ntriphosphate (ATP) concentration on small myosin II ensembles made from\ndifferent isoforms. For skeletal and smooth muscle myosin II, which are often\nused in actomyosin gels that reconstitute cell contractility, fast forward\nmovement is restricted to a small region of phase space with low mechanical\nload and high ATP concentration, which is also characterized by frequent\nensemble detachment. At high load, these ensembles are stalled or move\nbackwards, but forward motion can be restored by decreasing ATP concentration.\nIn contrast, small ensembles of nonmuscle myosin II isoforms, which are found\nin the cytoskeleton of nonmuscle cells, are hardly affected by ATP\nconcentration due to the slow kinetics of the bound states. For all isoforms,\nthe thermodynamic efficiency of ensemble movement increases with decreasing ATP\nconcentration, but this effect is weaker for the nonmuscle myosin II isoforms.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03005v1', ['Subcellular Processes'], [u'Heidelberg University']]
