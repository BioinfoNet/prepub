[u'Directly measuring single molecule heterogeneity using force\n  spectroscopy', ['Michael Hinczewski', 'Changbong Hyeon', 'D. Thirumalai'], u'2016-05-24', u'One of the most intriguing results of single molecule experiments on proteins\nand nucleic acids is the discovery of functional heterogeneity: the observation\nthat complex cellular machines exhibit multiple, biologically active\nconformations. The structural differences between these conformations may be\nsubtle, but each distinct state can be remarkably long-lived, with random\ninterconversions between states occurring only at macroscopic timescales,\nfractions of a second or longer. Though we now have proof of functional\nheterogeneity in a handful of systems---enzymes, motors, adhesion\ncomplexes---identifying and measuring it remains a formidable challenge. Here\nwe show that evidence of this phenomenon is more widespread than previously\nknown, encoded in data collected from some of the most well-established single\nmolecule techniques: AFM or optical tweezer pulling experiments. We present a\ntheoretical procedure for analyzing distributions of rupture/unfolding forces\nrecorded at different pulling speeds. This results in a single parameter,\nquantifying the degree of heterogeneity, and also leads to bounds on the\nequilibration and conformational interconversion timescales. Surveying ten\npublished datasets, we find heterogeneity in five of them, all with\ninterconversion rates slower than 10 s$^{-1}$. Moreover, we identify two\nsystems where additional data at realizable pulling velocities is likely to\nfind a theoretically predicted, but so far unobserved cross-over regime between\nheterogeneous and non-heterogeneous behavior. The significance of this regime\nis that it will allow far more precise estimates of the slow conformational\nswitching times, one of the least understood aspects of functional\nheterogeneity.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07294v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'From Local Chaos to Critical Slowing Down: A Theory of the Functional\n  Connectivity of Small Neural Circuits', ['Diego Fasoli', 'Anna Cattani', 'Stefano Panzeri'], u'2016-05-24', u'Functional connectivity is a fundamental property of neural networks that\nquantifies the segregation and integration of information between cortical\nareas. Due to mathematical complexity, a theory that could explain how the\nparameters of mesoscopic networks composed of a few tens of neurons affect the\nfunctional connectivity is still to be formulated. Yet, many interesting\nproblems in neuroscience involve the study of networks composed of a small\nnumber of neurons. Based on a recent study of the dynamics of small neural\ncircuits, we combine the analysis of local bifurcations of multi-population\nneural networks of arbitrary size with the analytical calculation of the\nfunctional connectivity. We study the functional connectivity in different\nregimes, showing that external stimuli cause the network to switch from\nasynchronous states characterized by weak correlation and low variability\n(local chaos), to synchronous states characterized by strong correlations and\nwide temporal fluctuations (critical slowing down). Local chaos typically\noccurs in large networks, but here we show that it can also be generated by\nstrong stimuli in small neural circuits. On the other side, critical slowing\ndown is expected to occur when the stimulus moves the network close to a local\nbifurcation. In particular, strongly positive correlations occur at the\nsaddle-node and Andronov-Hopf bifurcations of the network, while strongly\nnegative correlations occur when the network undergoes a spontaneous\nsymmetry-breaking at the branching-point bifurcations. These results prove that\nthe functional connectivity of firing-rate network models is strongly affected\nby the external stimuli even if the anatomical connections are fixed, and\nsuggest an effective mechanism through which biological networks can\ndynamically modulate the encoding and integration of sensory information.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07383v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Semiparametric energy-based probabilistic models', ['Jan Humplik', 'Gasper Tkacik'], u'2016-05-24', u"Probabilistic models can be defined by an energy function, where the\nprobability of each state is proportional to the exponential of the state's\nnegative energy. This paper considers a generalization of energy-based models\nin which the probability of a state is proportional to an arbitrary positive,\nstrictly decreasing, and twice differentiable function of the state's energy.\nThe precise shape of the nonlinear map from energies to unnormalized\nprobabilities has to be learned from data together with the parameters of the\nenergy function. As a case study we show that the above generalization of a\nfully visible Boltzmann machine yields an accurate model of neural activity of\nretinal ganglion cells. We attribute this success to the model's ability to\neasily capture distributions whose probabilities span a large dynamic range, a\npossible consequence of latent variables that globally couple the system.\nSimilar features have recently been observed in many datasets, suggesting that\nour new method has wide applicability.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07371v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Efficient and accurate extraction of in vivo calcium signals from\n  microendoscopic video data', ['Pengcheng Zhou', 'Shanna L. Resendez', 'Garret D. Stuber', 'Robert E. Kass', 'Liam Paninski'], u'2016-05-24', u'In vivo calcium imaging through microscopes has enabled deep brain imaging of\npreviously inaccessible neuronal populations within the brains of freely moving\nsubjects. However, microendoscopic data suffer from high levels of background\nfluorescence as well as an increased potential for overlapping neuronal\nsignals. Previous methods fail in identifying neurons and demixing their\ntemporal activity because the cellular signals are often submerged in the large\nfluctuating background. Here we develop an efficient method to extract cellular\nsignals with minimal influence from the background. We model the background\nwith two realistic components: (1) one models the constant baseline and slow\ntrends of each pixel, and (2) the other models the fast fluctuations from\nout-of-focus signals and is therefore constrained to have low spatial-frequency\nstructure. This decomposition avoids cellular signals being absorbed into the\nbackground term. After subtracting the background approximated with this model,\nwe use Constrained Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (CNMF, Pnevmatikakis et al.\n(2016)) to better demix neural signals and get their denoised and deconvolved\ntemporal activity. We validate our method on simulated and experimental data,\nwhere it shows fast, reliable, and high quality signal extraction under a wide\nvariety of imaging parameters.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07266v1', ['Neurons and Cognition', 'Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Communities as cliques', ['Yael Fried', 'David A. Kessler', 'Nadav M. Shnerb'], u'2016-05-24', u"High-diversity assemblages are very common in nature, and yet the factors\nallowing for the maintenance of biodiversity remain obscure. The competitive\nexclusion principle and May's complexity-diversity puzzle both suggest that a\ncommunity can support only a small number of species, turning the spotlight at\nthe dynamics of local patches or islands, where stable and uninvadable (SU)\nsubsets of species play a crucial role. Here we map the community SUs question\nto the geometric problem of finding maximal cliques of the corresponding graph.\nWe solve for the number of SUs as a function of the species richness in the\nregional pool, $N$, showing that this growth is subexponential, contrary to\nlong-standing wisdom. We show that symmetric systems relax rapidly to an SU,\nwhere the system stays until a regime shift takes place.

[u'Modeling delayed processes in biological systems', ['Jingchen Feng', 'Stuart Sevier', 'Bin Huang', 'Dongya Jia', 'Herbert Levine'], u'2016-05-24', u'Delayed processes are ubiquitous in biological systems and are often\ncharacterized by delay differential equations (DDEs) and their extension to\ninclude stochastic effects. DDEs do not explicitly incorporate intermediate\nstates associated with a delayed process but instead use an estimated average\ndelay time. In an effort to examine the validity of this approach, we study\nsystems with significant delays by explicitly incorporating intermediate steps.\nWe show by that such explicit models often yield significantly different\nequilibrium distributions and transition times as compared to DDEs with\ndeterministic delay values. Additionally, different explicit models with\nqualitatively different dynamics can give rise to the same DDEs revealing\nimportant ambiguities. We also show that DDE-based predictions of oscillatory\nbehavior may fail for the corresponding explicit model.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07304v1', ['Quantitative Methods', 'Molecular Networks'], []]

In order to control\nvortices, two problems should be overcome: both, the geometric positions of\ntheir cores, and the positions of their critical time windows, are not known\nduring fibrillation. The first problem we have solved previously using an\nelectric field pulse to excite the cores of all pinned vortices simultaneously.\nApproaches to solve the second problem are being developed. One of them is\nbased on scanning the phase spaces of all pinned vortices in parallel to hit\nthe critical time window of every pinned vortex. In this paper, we investigate\nthe related physical mechanisms using simple two variable models as well as a\ndetailed ionic model of the cardiac tissue. A similar mechanism terminates also\na free (not pinned) vortex, when the vortex's core passes not very far from a\ndefect. A series of about 500 experiments with termination of vortices during\nventricular fibrillation in pig isolated hearts confirms that pinned vortices,\nhidden from direct observation, are significant in fibrillation.

[u'Network approach integrates 3D structural and sequence data to improve\n  protein classification', ['Fazle E. Faisal', 'Julie L. Chaney', 'Jun Li', 'Patricia L. Clark', 'Tijana Milenkovic'], u'2016-05-24', u'Motivation: Early approaches for protein (structural) classification were\nsequence-based. Since amino acids that are distant in the sequence can be close\nin the 3-dimensional (3D) structure, 3D contact approaches can complement\nsequence approaches. Traditional 3D contact approaches study 3D structures\ndirectly. Instead, 3D structures can first be modeled as protein structure\nnetworks (PSNs). Then, network approaches can be used to classify the PSNs.\nNetwork approaches may improve upon traditional 3D contact approaches. We\ncannot use existing PSN approaches to test this, because: 1) They rely on naive\nmeasures of network topology that cannot capture the complexity of PSNs. 2)\nThey are not robust to PSN size. They cannot integrate 3) multiple PSN measures\nor 4) PSN data with sequence data, although this could help because the\ndifferent data types capture complementary biological knowledge.\n  Results: We address these limitations by: 1) exploiting well-established\ngraphlet measures via a new network approach for protein classification, 2)\nintroducing novel normalized graphlet measures to remove the bias of PSN size,\n3) allowing for integrating multiple PSN measures, and 4) using ordered\ngraphlets to combine the complementary ideas of PSN data and sequence data. We\nclassify both synthetic networks and real-world PSNs more accurately and faster\nthan existing network, 3D contact, or sequence approaches. Our approach finds\nPSN patterns that may be biochemically interesting.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07247v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
[u'Transcriptional Similarity in Couples Reveals the Impact of Shared\n  Environment and Lifestyle on Gene Regulation through Modified Cytosines', ['Ke Tang', 'Wei Zhang'], u'2016-05-24', u'Gene expression is a complex and quantitative trait that is influenced by\nboth genetic and non-genetic regulators including environmental factors.\nEvaluating the contribution of environment to gene expression regulation and\nidentifying which genes are more likely to be influenced by environmental\nfactors are important for understanding human complex traits. We hypothesize\nthat by living together as couples, there can be commonly co-regulated genes\nthat may reflect the shared living environment (e.g., diet, indoor air\npollutants, behavioral lifestyle). The lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived\nfrom unrelated couples of African ancestry (YRI, Yoruba people from Ibadan,\nNigeria) from the International HapMap Project provided a unique model for us\nto characterize gene expression pattern in couples by comparing gene expression\nlevels between husbands and wives. Strikingly, 778 genes were found to show\nmuch smaller variances in couples than random pairs of individuals at a false\ndiscovery rate (FDR) of 5%. Since genetic variation between unrelated family\nmembers in a general population is expected to be the same assuming a\nrandom-mating society, non-genetic factors (e.g., epigenetic systems) are more\nlikely to be the mediators for the observed transcriptional similarity in\ncouples. We thus evaluated the contribution of modified cytosines to those\ngenes showing transcriptional similarity in couples as well as the\nrelationships these CpG sites with other gene regulatory elements, such as\ntranscription factor binding sites (TFBS). Our findings suggested that\ntranscriptional similarity in couples likely reflected shared common\nenvironment partially mediated through cytosine modifications.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07488v1', ['Genomics'], []]
