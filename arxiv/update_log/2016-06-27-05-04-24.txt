[u'How to estimate epidemic risk from incomplete contact diaries data?', ['Alain Barrat', 'Rossana Mastrandrea'], u'2016-06-24', u'Social interactions shape the patterns of spreading processes in a\npopulation. Techniques such as diaries or proximity sensors allow to collect\ndata about encounters and to build networks of contacts between individuals.\nThe contact networks obtained from these different techniques are however\nquantitatively different. Here, we first show how these discrepancies affect\nthe prediction of the epidemic risk when these data are fed to numerical models\nof epidemic spread: low participation rate, under-reporting of contacts and\noverestimation of contact durations in contact diaries with respect to sensor\ndata determine indeed important differences in the outcomes of the\ncorresponding simulations {with for instance an enhanced sensitivity to initial\nconditions}. Most importantly, we investigate if and how information gathered\nfrom contact diaries can be used in such simulations in order to yield an\naccurate description of the epidemic risk, assuming that data from sensors\nrepresent the ground truth. The contact networks built from contact sensors and\ndiaries present indeed several structural similarities: this suggests the\npossibility to construct, using only the contact diary network information, a\nsurrogate contact network such that simulations using this surrogate network\ngive the same estimation of the epidemic risk as simulations using the contact\nsensor network. We present and {compare} several methods to build such\nsurrogate data, and show that it is indeed possible to obtain a good agreement\nbetween the outcomes of simulations using surrogate and sensor data, as long as\nthe contact diary information is complemented by publicly available data\ndescribing the heterogeneity of the durations of human contacts.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07769v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Global Properties of Nested Network Model with Application to\n  Multi-Epitope HIV/CTL Dynamics', ['Cameron J. Browne'], u'2016-06-24', u'Mathematical modeling and analysis can provide insight on the dynamics of\necosystems which maintain biodiversity in the face of competitive and\nprey-predator interactions. Of primary interests are the underlying structure\nand features which stabilize diverse ecological networks. Recently Korytowski\nand Smith [17] proved that a perfectly nested infection network, along with\nappropriate life history trade-offs, leads to coexistence and persistence of\nbacteria-phage communities in a chemostat model. In this article, we generalize\ntheir model in order to apply it to the within-host dynamics virus and immune\nresponse, in particular HIV and CTL (Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte) cells. Our model\ncan produce a diverse hierarchy of viral and immune populations, built through\nsequential viral escape from dominant immune responses and rise in subdominant\nimmune responses, consistent with observed patterns of HIV/CTL evolution. We\nfind a Lyapunov function for the system which leads to rigorous\ncharacterization of persistent viral and immune variants, and informs upon\nequilibria stability and global dynamics. Results are interpreted in the\ncontext of within-host HIV/CTL evolution and numerical simulations are\nprovided.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07748v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Testing Modeling Assumptions in the West Africa Ebola Outbreak', ['Keith Burghardt', 'Christopher Verzijl', 'Junming Huang', 'Matthew Ingram', 'Binyang Song', 'Marie-Pierre Hasne'], u'2016-06-23', u'The Ebola virus in West Africa has infected almost 30,000 and killed over\n11,000 people. Recent models of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) have often made\nassumptions about how the disease spreads, such as uniform transmissibility and\nhomogeneous mixing within a population. In this paper, we test whether these\nassumptions are necessarily correct, and offer simple solutions that may\nimprove disease model accuracy. First, we use data and models of West African\nmigration to show that EVD does not homogeneously mix, but spreads in a much\nmore predictable manner. Next, we estimate the initial growth rate of EVD\nwithin country administrative divisions and find that it significantly\ndecreases with population density. Finally, we test whether EVD strains have\nuniform transmissibility through a novel statistical test, and find that\ncertain strains appear more often than expected by chance.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07497v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Natural calcium carbonate for biomedical applications', ['Sonali S. Sali'], u'2016-06-23', u'Sea shells are found to be a very rich natural resource for calcium\ncarbonate. Sea shells are made up of CaCO3 mainly in the aragonite form, which\nare columnar or fibrous or microsphere structured crystals. The bioactivity of\nnanoparticles of sea shell has been studied in this work. The sea shells\ncollected were thoroughly washed, dried and pulverized. The powder was sieved\nand particles in the range of 45 to 63 microns were collected. The powdered sea\nshells were characterized using X-Ray Diffraction and Field Emission Scanning\nElectron Microscopy. The XRD data showed that the particles were mainly\nmicrospheres. Traces of calcite and vaterite were also present. Experiments\nwere conducted to study the aspirin and strontium ranelate drug loading into\nthe sea shell powder using soak and dry method. Different concentrations of\ndrug solution was made in ethanol and water. The shell powder was soaked in\ndrug solutions and was kept soaking for 48 hrs with intermittent\nultrasonication. The mixture was gently dried in a vacuum oven. The in vitro\ndrug release studies were done using Phosphate Buffered Saline. The FESEM\nimages displayed a distribution of differently sized and shaped particles. The\nsea shells due to its natural porosity and crystallinity are expected to be\nuseful for drug delivery. About 50% drug entrapment efficiency for aspirin and\n39% for strontium ranelate was seen. A burst release of the drug (80 percent)\nwas observed within two hours for both the drugs studied. Rest of the drug was\nreleased slowly in 19 hrs. Further modification of the sea shell with non toxic\npolymers is also planned as a part of this work. Sea shell powder has become a\npotential candidate for drug delivery due to all the aforementioned advantages.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07779v1', ['Other'], []]
[u'Actin filaments growing against a barrier with fluctuating shape', ['Raj Kumar Sadhu', 'Sakuntala Chatterjee'], u'2016-06-24', u'We study force generation by a set of parallel actin filaments growing\nagainst a non-rigid obstacle, in presence of an external load. The filaments\npolymerize by either moving the whole obstacle, with a large energy cost, or by\ncausing local distortion in its shape which costs much less energy. The\nnon-rigid obstacle also has local thermal fluctuations due to which its shape\ncan change with time and we describe this using fluctuations in the height\nprofile of a one dimensional interface with Kardar-Parisi-Zhang dynamics. We\nfind the shape fluctuations of the barrier strongly affects the force\ngeneration mechanism. The qualitative nature of the force-velocity curve is\ncrucially determined by the relative time-scale of filament and barrier\ndynamics. The height profile of the barrier also shows interesting variation\nwith the external load. Our analytical calculation within mean-field theory\nshows reasonable agreement with our simulation results.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07553v1', ['Subcellular Processes'], []]
[u'Collective motion of cells crawling on a substrate: roles of cell shape\n  and contact inhibition', ['Simon Kaspar Schnyder', 'Yuki Tanaka', 'John Jairo Molina', 'Ryoichi Yamamoto'], u'2016-06-24', u"Contact inhibition plays a crucial role in the motility of cells, the process\nof wound healing, and the formation of tumors. By mimicking the mechanical\nmotion of calls crawling on a substrate using a pseudopod, we constructed a\nminimal model for migrating cells which gives rise to contact inhibition of\nlocomotion (CIL) naturally. The model cell consists of two disks, one in the\nfront (a pseudopod) and the other one in the back (cell body), connected by a\nfinitely extensible spring. Despite the simplicity of the model, the cells'\ncollective behavior is highly nontrivial, depending on the shape of cells and\nwhether CIL is enabled or not. Cells with a small front circle (i.e. a narrow\npseudopod) form immobile colonies. In contrast, cells with a large front circle\n(i.e. such as a lamellipodium) exhibit coherent migration without any explicit\nalignment mechanism being present in the model. This suggests that crawling\ncells often exhibit broad fronts because it helps them avoid clustering. Upon\nincreasing the density, the cells develop density waves which propagate against\nthe direction of cell migration and finally arrest at higher densities.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07618v1', ['Cell Behavior'], []]
