[u'Sufficient minimal model for DNA denaturation: Integration of harmonic\n  scalar elasticity and bond energies', ['Amit Raj Singh', 'Rony Granek'], u'2016-06-27', u'We study DNA denaturation by integrating elasticity -- as described by the\nGaussian network model -- with bond binding energies, distinguishing between\ndifferent base-pair and stacking energies. We use exact calculation, within the\nmodel, of the Helmholtz free-energy of any partial denaturation state, which\nimplies that the entropy of all formed bubbles ("loops") is accounted for.\nConsidering base-pair bond removal single events, the bond designated for\nopening is chosen by minimizing the free-energy difference for the process,\nover all remaining base-pair bonds. Despite of its great simplicity, for\nseveral known DNA sequences our results are in accord with available\ntheoretical and experimental studies. Moreover, we report free-energy profiles\nalong the denaturation pathway, which allow to detect stable or meta-stable\npartial denaturation states, composed of "bubbles", as local free-energy minima\nseparated by barriers. Our approach allows to study very long DNA strands with\ncommonly available computational power, as we demonstrate for a few random\nsequences in the range 200-800 base-pairs. For the latter we also elucidate the\nself-averaging property of the system. Implications for the well known\nbreathing dynamics of DNA are elucidated.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08223v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'The right time to learn: mechanisms and optimization of spaced learning', ['Paul Smolen', 'Yili Zhang', 'John H. Byrne'], u'2016-06-27', u'For many types of learning, spaced training that involves repeated long\ninter-trial intervals (ITIs) leads to more robust memory formation than does\nmassed training that involves short or no intervals. Several cognitive theories\nhave been proposed to explain this superiority, but only recently has data\nbegun to delineate the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of spaced\ntraining. We review these theories and data here. Computational models of the\nimplicated signaling cascades have predicted that spaced training with\nirregular ITIs can enhance learning. This strategy of using models to predict\noptimal spaced training protocols, combined with pharmacotherapy, suggests\nnovel ways to rescue impaired synaptic plasticity and learning.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08370v1', ['Neurons and Cognition', 'Molecular Networks'], []]

Independently, under the guise of integrated\ninformation theory, researchers have attempted to quantify the extent to which\na complex dynamical system presents a balance of integrated and segregated\nactivity.

[u'Information integration from distributed threshold-based interactions', ['Valmir C. Barbosa'], u'2016-06-27', u"We consider a collection of distributed units that interact with one another\nthrough the sending of messages. Each message carries a positive ($+1$) or\nnegative ($-1$) tag and causes the receiving unit to send out messages as a\nfunction of the tags it has received and a threshold. This simple model\nabstracts some of the essential characteristics of several systems used in the\nfield of artificial intelligence, and also of biological systems epitomized by\nthe brain. We study the integration of information inside a temporal window as\nthe model's dynamics unfolds. We quantify information integration by the total\ncorrelation, relative to the window's duration ($w$), of a set of random\nvariables valued as a function of message arrival. Total correlation refers to\nthe rise of information gain above and beyond that which the units already\nachieve individually, being therefore related to consciousness studies in some\nmodels. We report on extensive computational experiments that explore the\ninterrelations of the model's parameters (two probabilities and the threshold),\nhighlighting relevant scenarios of message traffic and how they impact the\nbehavior of total correlation as a function of $w$. We find that total\ncorrelation can occur at significant fractions of the maximum possible value\nand provide semi-analytical results on the message-traffic characteristics\nassociated with values of $w$ for which it peaks. We then reinterpret the\nmodel's parameters in terms of the current best estimates of some quantities\npertaining to cortical structure and dynamics. We find the resulting\npossibilities for best values of $w$ to be well aligned with the time frames\nwithin which percepts are thought to be processed and eventually rendered\nconscious.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08232v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

McClanahan', 'Matthew Spencer', 'Kamila Zychaluk'], u'2016-06-27', u'Coral reefs are dynamic systems whose composition is highly influenced by\nunpredictable biotic and abiotic factors. Understanding the spatial scale at\nwhich long-term predictions of reef composition can be made will be crucial for\nguiding conservation efforts. Using a 22-year time series of benthic\ncomposition data from 20 reefs on the Kenyan and Tanzanian coast, we studied\nthe long-term behaviour of Bayesian vector autoregressive state-space models\nfor reef dynamics, incorporating among-site variability. We estimate that if\nthere were no among-site variability, the total long-term variability would be\napproximately one third of its current value. Thus among-site variability\ncontributes more to long-term variability in reef composition than does\ntemporal variability. Individual sites are more predictable than previously\nthought, and predictions based on current snapshots are informative about\nlong-term properties. Our approach allowed us to identify a subset of possible\nclimate refugia sites with high conservation value, where the long-term\nprobability of coral cover <= 0.1 was very low. Analytical results show that\nthis probability is most strongly influenced by among-site variability and by\ninteractions among benthic components within sites. These findings suggest that\nconservation initiatives might be successful at the site scale as well as the\nregional scale.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08363v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

[u'Efficient Data Augmentation for Fitting Stochastic Epidemic Models to\n  Prevalence Data', ['Jonathan Fintzi', 'Jon Wakefield', 'Vladimir Minin'], u'2016-06-26', u'Stochastic epidemic models describe the dynamics of an epidemic as a disease\nspreads through a population. Typically, only a fraction of cases are observed\nat a set of discrete times. The absence of complete information about the time\nevolution of an epidemic gives rise to a complicated latent variable problem in\nwhich the state space size of the unobserved epidemic grows large as the\npopulation size increases. This makes analytically integrating over the missing\ndata infeasible for populations of even moderate size. We present a\ndata-augmentation Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework for Bayesian\nestimation of stochastic epidemic model parameters, in which measurements are\naugmented with subject-level trajectories. In our MCMC algorithm, we propose\neach new subject-level path, conditional on the data, using a\ntime-inhomogeneous continuous-time Markov process with rates determined by the\ninfection histories of other individuals. The method is general, and may be\napplied, with minimal modifications, to a broad class of stochastic epidemic\nmodels.

[u'Ligand-receptor binding kinetics in surface plasmon resonance cells: A\n  Monte Carlo analysis', ['Jacob Carroll', 'Matthew Raum', 'Kimberly Forsten-Williams', 'Uwe C. Tauber'], u'2016-06-27', u'Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) chips are widely used to measure association\nand dissociation rates for the binding kinetics between two species of\nchemicals, e.g., cell receptors and ligands. It is commonly assumed that\nligands are spatially well mixed in the SPR region, and hence a mean-field rate\nequation description is appropriate. This approximation however ignores the\nspatial fluctuations as well as temporal correlations induced by multiple local\nrebinding events, which become prominent for slow diffusion rates and high\nbinding affinities. We report detailed Monte Carlo simulations of ligand\nbinding kinetics in an SPR cell subject to laminar flow. We extract the binding\nand dissociation rates by means of the techniques frequently employed in\nexperimental analysis that are motivated by the mean-field approximation. We\nfind major discrepancies in a wide parameter regime between the thus extracted\nrates and the known input simulation values. These results underscore the\ncrucial quantitative importance of spatio-temporal correlations in binary\nreaction kinetics in SPR cell geometries, and demonstrate the failure of a\nmean-field analysis of SPR cells in the regime of high association rates, where\nthe spatio-temporal correlations due to diffusive transport and ligand-receptor\nrebinding events dominate the dynamics of SPR system.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08294v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], [u'Virginia Tech', u'Baker Hughes', u'Duquesne University']]
[u'A parallelizable sampling method for parameter inference of large\n  biochemical reaction models', ['Jan Mikelson', 'Mustafa Khammash'], u'2016-06-27', u'The development of mechanistic models of biological systems is a central part\nof Systems Biology. One major task in developing these models is the inference\nof the correct model parameters. Due to the size of most realistic models and\ntheir possibly complex dynamical behaviour one must usually rely on sample\nbased methods. In this paper we present a novel algorithm that reliably\nestimates model parameters for deterministic as well as stochastic models from\ntrajectory data. Our algorithm samples iteratively independent particles from\nthe level sets of the likelihood and recovers the posterior from these level\nsets. The presented approach is easily parallelizable and, by utilizing density\nestimation through Dirichlet Process Gaussian Mixture Models, can deal with\nhigh dimensional parameter spaces. We illustrate that our algorithm is\napplicable to large, realistic deterministic and stochastic models and succeeds\nin inferring the correct posterior from a given number of observed\ntrajectories.

[u'Discriminating sample groups with multi-way data', ['Tianmeng Lyu', 'Eric F. Lock', 'Lynn E. Eberly'], u'2016-06-26', u'High-dimensional linear classifiers, such as the support vector machine (SVM)\nand distance weighted discrimination (DWD), are commonly used in biomedical\nresearch to distinguish groups of subjects based on a large number of features.\nHowever, their use is limited to applications where a single vector of features\nis measured for each subject. In practice data are often multi-way, or measured\nover multiple dimensions. For example, metabolite abundance may be measured\nover multiple regions or tissues, or gene expression may be measured over\nmultiple time points, for the same subjects. We propose a framework for linear\nclassification of high-dimensional multi-way data, in which coefficients can be\nfactorized into weights that are specific to each dimension. More generally,\nthe coefficients for each measurement in a multi-way dataset are assumed to\nhave low-rank structure. This framework extends existing classification\ntechniques, and we have implemented multi-way versions of SVM and DWD. We\ndescribe informative simulation results, and apply multi-way DWD to data for\ntwo very different clinical research studies.

Recent work has found that microtubule\nrotational diffusion about minus-end attachment points contributes to\nkinetochore capture in fission yeast, but the relative contributions of dynamic\ninstability and rotational diffusion are not well understood. We have developed\na biophysical model of kinetochore capture in small fission-yeast nuclei using\nhybrid Brownian dynamics/kinetic Monte Carlo simulation techniques. With this\nmodel, we have studied the importance of dynamic instability and microtubule\nrotational diffusion for kinetochore capture, both to the lateral surface of a\nmicrotubule and at or near its end. Over a range of biologically relevant\nparameters, microtubule rotational diffusion decreased capture time, but made a\nrelatively small contribution compared to dynamic instability. At most,\nrotational diffusion reduced capture time by 25%. Our results suggest that\nwhile microtubule rotational diffusion can speed up kinetochore capture, it is\nunlikely to be the dominant physical mechanism. In addition, we found that when\nmicrotubules undergo dynamic instability, lateral captures predominate even in\nthe absence of rotational diffusion. Counterintuitively, adding rotational\ndiffusion to a dynamic microtubule increases the probability of end-on capture.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07847v1', ['Subcellular Processes'], []]

Here, we study the problem of down regulation of mRNA translation\nusing a mathematical model called the ribosome flow model (RFM). In the RFM,\nthe mRNA molecule is modeled as a chain of $n$ sites. The flow of ribosomes\nbetween consecutive sites is regulated by $n+1$ transition rates. Given a set\nof feasible transition rates, that models the outcome of all possible\nmutations, we consider the problem of maximally down regulating the translation\nrate by altering the rates within this set of feasible rates. Under certain\nconditions on the feasible set, we show that an optimal solution can be\ndetermined efficiently.
