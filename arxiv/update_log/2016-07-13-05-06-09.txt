[u'A Parallel Trajectory Swapping Wang - Landau Study Of The HP Protein\n  Model', ['Luke Kristopher Davis'], u'2016-07-12', u'The HP model of protein folding, where the chain exists in a free medium, is\ninvestigated using a parallel Monte Carlo scheme based upon Wang-Landau\nsampling. Expanding on the work of Wust and Landau by introducing a lesser\nknown replica -exchange scheme between individual Wang- Landau samplers, the\nproblem of dynamical trapping (spiking in the density of states) was avoided\nand an enhancement in the efficiency of traversing configuration space was\nobtained. Highlighting dynamical trapping as an issue for lattice polymer\nsimulations for increasing lengths is explicitly done here for the first time.\nThe 1/t scheme is also integrated within this sophisticated Monte Carlo\nmethodology. A trial move set was developed which includes pull, bond\nre-bridging, pivot, kink-flip and a newly invented and implemented fragment\nrandom walk move which allowed rapid exploration of high and low temperature\nconfigurations. A native state search was conducted leading to the attainment\nof the native states of the benchmark sequences of 2D50 (-21), 2D60 (-36)and\n2D64 (-42), whilst attaining minimum energies close to the native state for\n2D85(-52 NATIVE= -53), 2D100a (-47 NATIVE= -48) and 2D100b (-49 NATIVE=-50).\nThermodynamic observables such as the specific heat, internal energy, entropy\nand free energy were computed for 2D benchmark sequences at varying\ntemperatures and folding and unfolding behaviour was investigated. Lattice\npolymers with monomeric hydrophobic structure were also studied in the same\nmanner with the recording of minimum energy values and thermodynamic behaviour.\nThe native results for the benchmark sequences and lattice polymers were\ncompared with varying computational methods.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03253v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Populations can be essential in tracking dynamic optima', ['Duc-Cuong Dang', 'Thomas Jansen', 'Per Kristian Lehre'], u'2016-07-12', u'Real-world optimisation problems are often dynamic. Previously good solutions\nmust be updated or replaced due to changes in objectives and constraints. It is\noften claimed that evolutionary algorithms are particularly suitable for\ndynamic optimisation because a large population can contain different solutions\nthat may be useful in the future. However, rigorous theoretical demonstrations\nfor how populations in dynamic optimisation can be essential are sparse and\nrestricted to special cases.\n  This paper provides theoretical explanations of how populations can be\nessential in evolutionary dynamic optimisation in a general and natural\nsetting. We describe a natural class of dynamic optimisation problems where a\nsufficiently large population is necessary to keep track of moving optima\nreliably. We establish a relationship between the population-size and the\nprobability that the algorithm loses track of the optimum.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03317v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Statistical power and measurement bias in multisite resting-state fMRI\n  connectivity', ['Christian Dansereau', 'Yassine Benhajali', 'Celine Risterucci', 'Emilio Merlo Pich', 'Pierre Orban', 'Douglas Arnold', 'Pierre Bellec'], u'2016-07-12', u"Connectivity studies using resting-state functional magnetic resonance\nimaging are increasingly pooling data acquired at multiple sites. While this\nmay allow investigators to speed up recruitment or increase sample size,\nmultisite studies also potentially introduce systematic biases in connectivity\nmeasures across sites. In this work, we measure the inter-site bias in\nconnectivity and its impact on our ability to detect individual and group\ndifferences. Our study was based on real multisite fMRI datasets collected in\nN=345 young, healthy subjects across 8 scanning sites with 3T scanners and\nheterogeneous scanning protocols. We first empirically show that typical\nfunctional networks were reliably found at the group level in all sites, and\nthat the amplitude of the inter-site bias was small to moderate, with a Cohen's\neffect size below 0.5 on average across brain connections. We then implemented\na series of Monte-Carlo simulations, based on real data, to evaluate the impact\nof the multisite bias on detection power in statistical tests comparing two\ngroups (with and without the effect) using a general linear model, as well as\non the prediction of group labels with a support-vector machine. As a\nreference, we also implemented the same simulations with fMRI data collected at\na single site using an identical sample size. Simulations revealed that using\ndata from heterogeneous sites only slightly decreased our ability to detect\nchanges compared to a monosite study with the GLM, and had a more serious\nimpact on prediction accuracy. However, the deleterious effect of multisite\ndata pooling tended to decrease as the total sample size increased, to a point\nwhere differences between monosite and multisite simulations were small with\nN=120 subjects. Taken together, our results support the feasibility of\nmultisite studies in rs-fMRI provided sample size is large enough.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03392v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Mass spectrometry analysis using MALDIquant', ['Sebastian Gibb', 'Korbinian Strimmer'], u'2016-07-11', u'MALDIquant and associated R packages provide a versatile and completely free\nopen-source platform for analyzing 2D mass spectrometry data as generated for\ninstance by MALDI and SELDI instruments. We first describe the various methods\nand algorithms available in MALDIquant . Subsequently, we illustrate a typical\nanalysis workflow using MALDIquant by investigating an experimental cancer data\nset, starting from raw mass spectrometry measurements and ending at\nmultivariate classification.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03180v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Hydrodynamic theory of tissue shear flow', ['Marko Popovic', 'Amitabha Nandi', 'Matthias Merkel', 'Raphael Etournay', 'Suzanne Eaton', 'Frank Julicher', 'Guillaume Salbreux'], u'2016-07-12', u'We propose a hydrodynamic theory to describe shear flows in developing\nepithelial tissues. We introduce hydrodynamic fields corresponding to state\nproperties of constituent cells as well as a contribution to overall tissue\nshear flow due to rearrangements in cell network topology. We then construct a\nconstitutive equation for the shear rate due to topological rearrangements. We\nidentify a novel rheological behaviour resulting from memory effects in the\ntissue. We show that anisotropic deformation of tissue and cells can arise from\ntwo distinct active cellular processes: generation of active stress in the\ntissue, and actively driven cellular rearrangements. These two active processes\nresult in distinct cellular and tissue shape changes, depending on boundary\nconditions applied on the tissue. Our findings have consequences for the\nunderstanding of tissue morphogenesis during development.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03304v1', ['Tissues and Organs', 'Cell Behavior'], []]
[u'Theory for transitions between log and stationary phases: universal laws\n  for lag time', ['Yusuke Himeoka', 'Kunihiko Kaneko'], u'2016-07-12', u"Quantitative characterization of bacterial growth has gathered substantial\nattention since Monod's pioneering study. Theoretical and experimental work has\nuncovered several laws for describing the log growth phase, in which the number\nof cells grows exponentially. However, microorganism growth also exhibits lag,\nstationary, and death phases under starvation conditions, in which cell growth\nis highly suppressed, while quantitative laws or theories for such phases are\nunderdeveloped. In fact, models commonly adopted for the log phase that consist\nof autocatalytic chemical components, including ribosomes, can only show\nexponential growth or decay in a population, and phases that halt growth are\nnot realized. Here, we propose a simple, coarse-grained cell model that\nincludes inhibitor molecule species in addition to the autocatalytic active\nprotein. The inhibitor forms a complex with active proteins to suppress the\ncatalytic process. Depending on the nutrient condition, the model exhibits the\ntypical transition among the lag, log, stationary, and death phases.\nFurthermore, the lag time needed for growth recovery after starvation follows\nthe square root of the starvation time and is inverse to the maximal growth\nrate, in agreement with experimental observations. Moreover, the distribution\nof lag time among cells shows an exponential tail, also consistent with\nexperiments. Our theory further predicts strong dependence of lag time upon the\nspeed of substrate depletion, which should be examined experimentally. The\npresent model and theoretical analysis provide universal growth laws beyond the\nlog phase, offering insight into how cells halt growth without entering the\ndeath phase.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03246v1', ['Subcellular Processes', 'Cell Behavior'], []]
