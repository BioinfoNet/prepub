[u'Linking structure and activity in nonlinear spiking networks', ['Gabriel Koch Ocker', 'Kresimir Josic', 'Eric Shea-Brown', 'Michael A. Buice'], u'2016-10-12', u"Recent experimental advances are producing an avalanche of data on both\nneural connectivity and neural activity. To take full advantage of these two\nemerging datasets we need a framework that links them, revealing how collective\nneural activity arises from the structure of neural connectivity and intrinsic\nneural dynamics. This problem of structure-driven activity has drawn major\ninterest in computational neuroscience. Existing methods for relating activity\nand architecture in spiking networks rely on linearizing activity around a\ncentral operating point and thus fail to capture the nonlinear responses of\nindividual neurons that are the hallmark of neural information processing.\nHere, we overcome this limitation and present a new relationship between\nconnectivity and activity in networks of nonlinear spiking neurons. We\nexplicitly show how recurrent network structure produces pairwise and\nhigher-order correlated activity, and how nonlinearities impact the networks'\nspiking activity. Finally, we demonstrate how correlations due to recurrent\nconnectivity impact the fidelity with which populations encode simple signals\nand how nonlinear dynamics impose a new effect of correlations on coding: to\ntranslate response distributions in addition to stretching them. Our findings\nopen new avenues to investigating how neural nonlinearities, including those\nexpressed across multiple cell types, combine with connectivity to shape\npopulation activity and function.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03828v1', ['Neurons and Cognition', 'Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'A Continuous Model of Cortical Connectivity', ['Daniel Moyer', 'Boris A. Gutman', 'Joshua Faskowitz', 'Neda Jahanshad', 'Paul M. Thompson'], u'2016-10-12', u'We present a continuous model for structural brain connectivity based on the\nPoisson point process. The model treats each streamline curve in a tractography\nas an observed event in connectome space, here a product space of cortical\nwhite matter boundaries. We approximate the model parameter via kernel density\nestimation. To deal with the heavy computational burden, we develop a fast\nparameter estimation method by pre-computing associated Legendre products of\nthe data, leveraging properties of the spherical heat kernel. We show how our\napproach can be used to assess the quality of cortical parcellations with\nrespect to connectivty. We further present empirical results that suggest the\ndiscrete connectomes derived from our model have substantially higher\ntest-retest reliability compared to standard methods.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03809v1', ['Neurons and Cognition', 'Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Computing Integrated Information', ['Stephan Krohn', 'Dirk Ostwald'], u'2016-10-12', u'Integrated information theory (IIT) has received considerable attention as a\nnovel research paradigm for the study of consciousness in recent years. IIT\nessentially proposes that quantitative consciousness is identical to integrated\ninformation and proposed a framework for its quantification. The ensuing\nmeasure, however, has mainly been developed in discrete state systems, impeding\nits computation based on experimental data. In the current work, based on the\nmost recent instantiation of the theory ("Integrated information theory 3.0"),\nwe make progress towards overcoming this limitation by making the following\nnovel contributions: First, we formulate integrated information with respect to\nthe general language of probabilistic models. Second, we derive a constructive\nrule for the decomposition of a system into two disjoint subsystems, central to\nthe definition of integration. Third, we validate this general formulation by\nevaluating integrated information in a previously established discrete state\nexample system. Fourth, we show that the general formulation improves\nparsimony, as it eschews undefined conditional distributions and the need for\n"virtual elements". Fifth, we transfer integrated information to the context of\ncontinuous linear Gaussian systems, a versatile model class suitable for the\nmodelling of experimental data. Finally, by evaluation in parallel with the\nsystem state evolution, we explore the temporal dynamics of integrated\ninformation in the different model classes. In sum, the present formulation\noffers the prospect of computing integrated information from experimental data\nand may serve as a starting point for the further development of integrated\ninformation theory in an explicit probabilistic framework.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03627v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

[u'Cooperation driven by success-driven group formation', ['Attila Szolnoki', 'Xiaojie Chen'], u'2016-10-12', u'In the traditional setup of public goods game all players are involved in\nevery available groups and the mutual benefit is shared among competing\ncooperator and defector strategies. But in real life situations the group\nformation of players could be more sophisticated because not all players are\nattractive enough for others to participate in a joint venture. What if only\nthose players can initiate a group formation and establish a game who are\nsuccessful enough to the neighbors? To elaborate this idea we employ a modified\nprotocol and demonstrate that a carefully chosen threshold to establish joint\nventure could efficiently improve the cooperation level even if the synergy\nfactor would suggest a full defector state otherwise. The microscopic mechanism\nwhich is responsible for this effect is based on the asymmetric consequences of\ncompeting strategies: while the success of a cooperator provides a long-time\nwell-being for the neighborhood, the temporary advantage of defection cannot be\nmaintained if the protocol is based on the success of leaders.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03835v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

[u'Dynamic patterns of overexploitation in fisheries', ['Ilaria Perissi', 'Ugo Bardi', 'Toufic El Asmar', 'Alessandro Lavacchi'], u'2016-10-12', u"Understanding overfishing phenomenon and regulating fishing quotas is a major\nglobal challenge for the 21st Century both in terms of providing food for\nhumankind and to preserve the oceans ecosystems. However, fishing is a complex\neconomic activity, affected not just by overfishing but also by such factors as\npollution, technology, financial factors and more. For this reason, it is often\ndifficult to state with complete certainty that overfishing is the cause of the\ndecline of a fishery. In this study, we developed a simple dynamic model based\non the earlier, well-known Lotka-Volterra model or Prey-Predator model. To\ndescribe exploitation patterns, we assume that the fish stock and the fishing\nindustry are coupled stock variables in the model and they dynamically affect\neach other, with the fishing yield proportional to both the fishing capital and\nthe fish stock. The model is based on the concept that the fishing industry\nacts as the predator of the resource and that its growth and subsequent decline\nis directly related to the abundance of the fish stock. If the model can be fit\nhistorical data relative to specific fisheries, then it is a strong indication\nthat the fishing industry is strongly affected by the magnitude of the fish\nstock and that, in particular, the decline of the yield and the decline of the\nstock are linked to each other. The model does not pretend to be a general\ndescription of the fishing industry in all its varied forms; however, the data\nreported here show that the model can indeed qualitatively describe several\nhistorical case of the collapse of fisheries. The model can also be used as a\nqualitative guide to understand the behavior of several other fisheries. These\nresult indicate that one of the main factors causing the present crisis of the\nworld's fisheries is the overexploitation of the fish stocks.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03653v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'MI-Sim: A MATLAB Package for the Numerical Analysis of Microbial\n  Ecological Interactions', ['M. J. Wade', 'J. Oakley', 'S. Harbisher', 'N. G. Parker', 'J.

They have application across scales where they differ only in the\nunderlying characteristics of the organisms and substrates describing the\nsystem. Mathematical modelling, using mechanistic approaches to describe the\ndynamic behaviour and properties of the system through sets of ordinary\ndifferential equations, has been used extensively in ecology. Models allow\nsimulation of the dynamics of the various motifs and their numerical analysis\nprovides a greater understanding of the interplay between the system components\nand their intrinsic properties. We have developed the MI-Sim software for use\nwith MATLAB to allow a rigorous and rapid numerical analysis of several common\necological motifs. MI-Sim contains a series of the most commonly used motifs\nsuch as cooperation, competition and predation. It does not require detailed\nknowledge of mathematical analytical techniques and is offered as a single\ngraphical user interface containing all input and output options. The tools\navailable in the current version of MI-Sim include model simulation, steady-\nstate existence and stability analysis, and basin of attraction analysis. The\nsoftware includes seven ecological interaction motifs and seven growth function\nmodels. Unlike other system analysis tools, MI-Sim is designed as a simple and\nuser-friendly tool specific to ecological population type models, allowing for\nrapid assessment of their dynamical and behavioural properties.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03786v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'A Review of Mathematical Models for Muscular Dystrophy: A Systems\n  Biology Approach', ['Amanda N. Cameron', 'Matthew T. Houston', 'Juan B. Gutierrez'], u'2016-10-11', u"Muscular dystrophy (MD) describes generalized progressive muscular weakness\ndue to the wasting of muscle fibers. While this is an umbrella term used to\ndescribe a wide range of muscle wasting diseases, the two types that have been\nmost extensively mathematically modeled are Duchenne's (DMD) and Becker's\n(BMD), with DMD being the most common childhood form of MD. Developing\nmathematical models to understand and treat MD involves the integration of\npreviously established immunological and mechanical representations of these\nfactors that bolster disease progression. This article reviews these\nmathematical models and examines key molecular and cellular perspectives to\nbetter understand MD's pathogenesis and subsequent progression. Molecular\nfactors that contribute to MD include mitochondrial and genetic components;\nboth drive cellular metabolism, communication and signaling. Furthermore, these\nmolecular factors leave cells vulnerable to mechanical stress which can\nactivate an immunological cascade that can weaken cells and surrounding\ntissues. This review article provides an essential, brief, biological\nbackground for mechanisms modeled. Given the application of developed\nimmunological and molecular models to a wider variety of neurodegenerative\ndiseases linked by related mitochondrial and genetic deficits, understanding\nand modeling MD is highly applicable.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03521v1', ['Quantitative Methods', 'Tissues and Organs'], []]
