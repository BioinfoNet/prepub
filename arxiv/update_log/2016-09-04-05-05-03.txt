[u'Separating Components of Attention and Surprise', ['Per Bkgaard', 'Michael Kai Petersen', 'Jakob Eg Larsen'], u'2016-08-30', u'Cognitive processes involved in both allocation of attention during decision\nmaking as well as surprise when making mistakes trigger release of the\nneurotransmitter norepinephrine, which has been shown to be correlated with an\nincrease in pupil dilation, in turn reflecting raised levels of arousal.\nExtending earlier experiments based on the Attention Network Test (ANT),\nseparating the neural components of alertness and spatial re-orientation from\nthe attention involved in more demanding conflict resolution tasks, we\ndemonstrate that these signatures of attention are so robust that they may be\nretrieved even when applying low cost eye tracking in an everyday mobile\ncomputing context. Furthermore we find that the reaction of surprise elicited\nwhen committing mistakes in a decision task, which in the neuroimaging EEG\nliterature have been referred to as a negativity feedback error correction\nsignal, may likewise be retrieved solely based on an increase in pupil\ndilation.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08492v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Learning and Inferring Relations in Cortical Networks', ['Peter U. Diehl', 'Matthew Cook'], u'2016-08-29', u'A pressing scientific challenge is to understand how brains work. Of\nparticular interest is the neocortex,the part of the brain that is especially\nlarge in humans, capable of handling a wide variety of tasks including visual,\nauditory, language, motor, and abstract processing. These functionalities are\nprocessed in different self-organized regions of the neocortical sheet, and yet\nthe anatomical structure carrying out the processing is relatively uniform\nacross the sheet. We are at a loss to explain, simulate, or understand such a\nmulti-functional homogeneous sheet-like computational structure - we do not\nhave computational models which work in this way. Here we present an important\nstep towards developing such models: we show how uniform modules of excitatory\nand inhibitory neurons can be connected bidirectionally in a network that, when\nexposed to input in the form of population codes, learns the input encodings as\nwell as the relationships between the inputs. STDP learning rules lead the\nmodules to self-organize into a relational network, which is able to infer\nmissing inputs,restore noisy signals, decide between conflicting inputs, and\ncombine cues to improve estimates. These networks show that it is possible for\na homogeneous network of spiking units to self-organize so as to provide\nmeaningful processing of its inputs. If such networks can be scaled up, they\ncould provide an initial computational model relevant to the large scale\nanatomy of the neocortex.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08267v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
