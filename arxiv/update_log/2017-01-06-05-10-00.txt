[u'Circular spectropolarimetric sensing of chiral photosystems in decaying leaves', ['C. H. Lucas Patty', 'Luuk J. J. Visser', 'Freek Ariese', 'Wybren Jan Buma', 'William B. Sparks', 'Rob J. M. van Spanning', 'Wilfred F. M. Roling', 'Frans Snik'], u'2017-01-05', u'Circular polarization spectroscopy has proven to be an indispensable tool in photosynthesis research and (bio)-molecular research in general. Oxygenic photosystems typically display an asymmetric Cotton effect around the chlorophyll absorbance maximum with a signal $\\leq 1 \\%$. In vegetation, these signals are the direct result of the chirality of the supramolecular aggregates. The circular polarization is thus directly influenced by the composition and architecture of the photosynthetic macrodomains, and is thereby linked to photosynthetic functioning. Although ordinarily measured only on a molecular level, we have developed a new spectropolarimetric instrument, TreePol, that allows for both laboratory and in-the-field measurements. Through spectral multiplexing, TreePol is capable of fast measurements with a sensitivity of $\\sim 1*10^{-4}$ and is therefore suitable of non-destructively probing the molecular architecture of whole plant leaves. We have measured the chiroptical evolution of \\textit{Hedera helix} leaves for a period of 22 days. Spectrally resolved circular polarization measurements (450-900 nm) on whole leaves in transmission exhibit a strong decrease in the polarization signal over time after plucking, which we accredit to the deterioration of chiral macro-aggregates. Chlorophyll \\textit{a} levels measured over the same period by means of UV-Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy showed a much smaller decrease. With these results we are able to distinguish healthy from deteriorating leaves. Hereby we indicate the potency of circular polarization spectroscopy on whole and intact leaves as a nondestructive tool for structural and plant stress assessment. Additionally, we underline the establishment of circular polarization signals as remotely accessible means of detecting the presence of extraterrestrial life.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.01297v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Groupwise Structural Parcellation of the Cortex: A Sound Approach Based on Logistic Models', ['Guillermo Gallardo', 'William Wells Iii', 'Rachid Deriche', 'Demian Wassermann'], u'2017-01-05', u'Current theories hold that brain function is highly related to long-range physical connections through axonal bundles, namely extrinsic connectiv-ity. However, obtaining a groupwise cortical parcellation based on extrinsic connectivity remains challenging. Current parcellation methods are compu-tationally expensive; need tuning of several parameters or rely on ad-hoc constraints. Furthermore, none of these methods present a model for the cortical extrinsic connectivity of the cortex. To tackle these problems, we propose a parsimonious model for the extrinsic connectivity and an efficient parceling technique based on clustering of tractograms. Our technique allows the creation of single subject and groupwise parcellations of the whole cortex. The parcellations obtained with our technique are in agreement with structural and functional parcellations in the literature. In particular, the motor and sensory cortex are subdivided in agreement with the human ho-munculus of Penfield. We illustrate this by comparing our resulting parcels with the motor strip mapping included in the Human Connectome Project data.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.01315v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], [u'ATHENA', u'HMS']]
[u'Extracting the Groupwise Core Structural Connectivity Network: Bridging Statistical and Graph-Theoretical Approaches', ['Nahuel Lascano', 'Dorian Mazauric', 'Guillermo Gallardo', 'Demian Wassermann'], u'2017-01-05', u"Finding the common structural brain connectivity network for a given population is an open problem, crucial for current neuro-science. Recent evidence suggests there's a tightly connected network shared between humans. Obtaining this network will, among many advantages , allow us to focus cognitive and clinical analyses on common connections, thus increasing their statistical power. In turn, knowledge about the common network will facilitate novel analyses to understand the structure-function relationship in the brain. In this work, we present a new algorithm for computing the core structural connectivity network of a subject sample combining graph theory and statistics. Our algorithm works in accordance with novel evidence on brain topology. We analyze the problem theoretically and prove its complexity. Using 309 subjects, we show its advantages when used as a feature selection for connectivity analysis on populations, outperforming the current approaches.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.01311v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], [u'ABS', u'ATHENA']]
[u'Is neuroscience facing up to statistical power?', ['Geoffrey J Goodhill'], u'2017-01-05', u'It has been demonstrated that the statistical power of many neuroscience studies is very low, so that the results are unlikely to be robustly reproducible. How are neuroscientists and the journals in which they publish responding to this problem? Here I review the sample size justifications provided for all 15 papers published in one recent issue of the leading journal Nature Neuroscience. Of these, only one claimed it was adequately powered. The others mostly appealed to the sample sizes used in earlier studies, despite a lack of evidence that these earlier studies were adequately powered. Thus, concerns regarding statistical power in neuroscience have mostly not yet been addressed.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.01219v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'The Diverse Club: The Integrative Core of Complex Networks', ['M. A. Bertolero', 'B. T. T. Yeo', "M. D'Esposito"], u'2017-01-04', u'A complex system can be represented and analyzed as a network, where nodes represent the units of the network and edges represent connections between those units. For example, a brain network represents neurons as nodes and axons between neurons as edges. In many networks, some nodes have a disproportionately high number of edges. These nodes also have many edges between each other, and are referred to as the rich club. In many different networks, the nodes of this club are assumed to support global network integration. However, another set of nodes potentially exhibits a connectivity structure that is more advantageous to global network integration. Here, in a myriad of different biological and man-made networks, we discover the diverse club--a set of nodes that have edges diversely distributed across the network. The diverse club exhibits, to a greater extent than the rich club, properties consistent with an integrative network function--these nodes are more highly interconnected and their edges are more critical for efficient global integration. Moreover, we present a generative evolutionary network model that produces networks with a diverse club but not a rich club, thus demonstrating that these two clubs potentially evolved via distinct selection pressures. Given the variety of different networks that we analyzed--the c. elegans, the macaque brain, the human brain, the United States power grid, and global air traffic--the diverse club appears to be ubiquitous in complex networks. These results warrant the distinction and analysis of two critical clubs of nodes in all complex systems.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.01150v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Revealing the hidden structure of dynamic ecological networks', ['Vincent Miele', 'Catherine Matias'], u'2017-01-05', u'Recent technological advances and long-term data studies provide interaction data that can be modelled through dynamic networks, i.e a sequence of different snapshots of an evolving ecological network. Most often time is the parameter along which these networks evolve but any other one-dimensional gradient (temperature, altitude, depth, humidity, . . . ) could be considered.Here we propose a statistical tool to analyse the underlying structure of these networks and follow its evolution dynamics (either in time or any other one-dimensional factor). It consists in extracting the main features of these networks and summarise them into a high-level view.We analyse a dynamic animal contact network and a seasonal food web and in both cases we show that our approach allows for the identification of a backbone organisation as well as interesting temporal variations at the individual level.Our method, implemented into the R package dynsbm, can handle the largest ecological datasets and is a versatile and promising tool for ecologists that study dynamic interactions.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.01355v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], [u'LPMA']]
[u'Cryo electron microscopy: 3-D reconstruction of stochastic objects having statistics with geometric symmetry from 2-D noisy conditionally-linear imaging', ['Nan Xu', 'Peter C Doerschuk'], u'2017-01-05', u'The images obtained from cryo electron microscopy are the projection of many heterogeneous instances of the object under study (e.g., a virus). When the object is heterogeneous but has an overall geometric symmetry, it is natural to describe the object as stochastic with symmetrical statistics. A maximum likelihood reconstruction approach is described in which all instances of the object lack symmetry but the statistics of the ensemble of objects are constrained to have symmetry. This algorithm is demonstrated on bacteriophage HK97 and is contrasted with existing algorithms in which each object, while still heterogeneous, has the symmetry. Reconstruction results show that the proposed algorithm eliminates long-standing distortions in previous heterogeneity calculations associated with symmetry axes, and provides estimates that make more biological sense than the estimates of existing algorithms.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.01206v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Rhombic Tilings and Primordia Fronts of Phyllotaxis', ['Pau Atela', 'Christophe Gole'], u'2017-01-04', u'We introduce and study properties of phyllotactic and rhombic tilings on the cylin- der. These are discrete sets of points that generalize cylindrical lattices. Rhombic tilings appear as periodic orbits of a discrete dynamical system S that models plant pattern formation by stacking disks of equal radius on the cylinder. This system has the advantage of allowing several disks at the same level, and thus multi-jugate config- urations. We provide partial results toward proving that the attractor for S is entirely composed of rhombic tilings and is a strongly normally attracting branched manifold and conjecture that this attractor persists topologically in nearby systems. A key tool in understanding the geometry of tilings and the dynamics of S is the concept of pri- mordia front, which is a closed ring of tangent disks around the cylinder. We show how fronts determine the dynamics, including transitions of parastichy numbers, and might explain the Fibonacci number of petals often encountered in compositae.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.01361v1', ['Tissues and Organs'], []]
[u'Contact enhancement of locomotion in spreading cell colonies', ["Joseph d'Alessandro", 'Alexandre P. Solon', 'Yoshinori Hayakawa', 'Christophe Anjard', 'Francois Detcheverry', 'Jean-Paul Rieu', 'Charlotte Riviere'], u'2017-01-05', u'The dispersal of cells from an initially constrained location is a crucial aspect of many physiological phenomena ranging from morphogenesis to tumour spreading. In such processes, the way cell-cell interactions impact the motion of single cells, and in turn the collective dynamics, remains unclear. Here, the spreading of micro-patterned colonies of non-cohesive cells is fully characterized from the complete set of individual trajectories. It shows that contact interactions, chemically mediated interactions and cell proliferation each dominates the dispersal process on different time scales. From data analysis and simulation of an active particle model, we demonstrate that contact interactions act to speed up the early population spreading by promoting individual cells to a state of higher persistence, which constitutes an as-yet unreported contact enhancement of locomotion. Our findings suggest that the current modeling paradigm of memoryless interacting active particles may need to be extended to account for the possibility of internal states and history-dependent behaviour of motile cells.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.01225v1', ['Cell Behavior'], []]
