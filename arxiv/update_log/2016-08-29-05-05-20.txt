[u'Reply to Comment on "Enhanced diffusion of enzymes that catalyze\n  exothermic reactions"', ['Ramin Golestanian'], u'2016-08-26', u'Catalytically active enzymes have recently been observed to exhibit enhanced\ndiffusion. In a recent work [C. Riedel et al., Nature 517, 227 (2015)], it has\nbeen suggested that this phenomenon is correlated with the degree of\nexothermicity of the reaction, and a mechanism was proposed to explain the\nphenomenon based on channeling the released heat into the center of mass\nkinetic energy of the enzyme. I addressed this question by comparing four\ndifferent mechanisms, and concluded that collective heating is the strongest\ncandidate out of those four to explain the phenomenon, and in particular,\nseveral orders of magnitude stronger than the mechanism proposed by Riedel et\nal. In a recent preprint (arXiv:1608.05433), K. Tsekouras, C. Riedel, R.\nGabizon, S. Marqusee, S. Presse, and C. Bustamante present a comment on my\npaper [R. Golestanian, Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 108102 (2015); arXiv:1508.03219],\nwhich I address here in this reply.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07469v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Multiphasic interactions between nucleotides and target proteins', ['Per Nissen'], u'2016-08-26', u'The nucleotides guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp) and guanosine pentaphosphate\n(pppGpp) bind to target proteins to promote bacterial survival (Corrigan et al.\n2016). Thus, the binding of the nucleotides to RsgA, a GTPase, inhibits the\nhydrolysis of GTP. The dose response, taken to be curvilinear with respect to\nthe logarithm of the inhibitor concentration, is instead much better (P<0.001\nwhen the 6 experiments are combined) represented as multiphasic, with high to\nexceedingly high absolute r values for the straight lines, and with transitions\nin the form of non-contiguities (jumps). Profiles for the binding of\nradiolabeled nucleotides to HprT and Gmk, GTP synthesis enzymes, were,\nsimilarly, taken to be curvilinear with respect to the logarithm of the protein\nconcentration. However, the profiles are again much better represented as\nmultiphasic than as curvilinear (the P values range from 0.047 to <0.001 for\neach of the 8 experiments for binding of ppGpp and pppGpp to HprT). The binding\nof GTP to HprT and the binding of the three nucleotides to Gmk are also poorly\nrepresented by curvilinear profiles, but well represented by multiphasic\nprofiles (straight and, in part, parallel lines).', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07459v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u"Stem Cell Therapy for Alzheimer's Disease", ['Ankur Patel', 'Grishma joshi', 'Rupali Ugile'], u'2016-08-26', u'The loss of neuronal cells in the central nervous system may happen in\nnumerous neurodegenerative illnesses. Alzheimer\'s Disease (AD) is an intricate,\nirreversible, dynamic neurodegenerative sickness. It is the main source of\nage-related dementia, influencing roughly 5.3 million individuals in the United\nStates alone. Promotion is a typical feeble ailment in individuals more than 65\nyears, bringing on disability described by decrease in memory, failure to learn\nand do every day exercises, intellectual weakness and influences the personal\nsatisfaction of patients. Pathologic qualities of AD are an irregular\ndevelopment of specific proteins called Beta-amyloid "plaques" and Tau\n"Tangles" in the mind. Notwithstanding, current treatments against AD are just\nto calm manifestations and palliative yet are not the cure and a few promising\nmedications competitors have fizzled in late clinical trials. There is\nconsequently a critical need to enhance our comprehension for pathogenesis of\nthis sickness, making new and creative prescient models with powerful\ntreatments. As of late, stem cell treatment has been appeared to have a\npotential way to deal with different illnesses, including neurodegenerative\ndisorders. In light of the far reaching nature of AD pathology, stem cell\nsubstitution procedures have been seen as an extraordinarily difficult and\nimpossible treatment approach. Stem Cell may likewise offer an effective new\nway to deal with model and concentrate AD. Patient derived induced Pluripotent\nStem Cells (iPSCs), for instance, may propel our comprehension of disease\nmechanism. In this review we will examine the capability of stem cells to help\nin these testing tries.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07499v1', ['Neurons and Cognition', 'Cell Behavior'], []]
[u'Average activity of excitatory and inhibitory neural populations', ['Javier Roulet', 'Bernardo Gabriel Mindlin'], u'2016-08-26', u'We develop an extension of the Ott-Antonsen method that allows obtaining the\nmean activity (spiking rate) of a population of excitable units. By means of\nthe Ott-Antonsen method, equations for the dynamics of the order parameters of\ncoupled excitatory and inhibitory populations of excitable units are obtained,\nand their mean activities are computed. Two different excitable systems are\nstudied: Adler units and theta neurons. The resulting bifurcation diagrams are\ncompared to those obtained from studying the phenomenological Wilson-Cowan\nmodel in some regions of the parameter space. Compatible behaviors, as well as\nhigher dimensional chaotic solutions, are observed. We study numerical\nsimulations to further validate the equations.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07364v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'SIS Epidemic Spreading with Correlated Heterogeneous Infection Rates', ['Bo Qu', 'Huijuan Wang'], u'2016-08-25', u'The epidemic spreading has been widely studied when each node may get\ninfected by an infected neighbor with the same rate. However, the infection\nrate between a pair of nodes is usually heterogeneous and even correlated with\ntheir nodal degrees in the contact network. We aim to understand how such\ncorrelated heterogeneous infection rates influence the spreading on different\nnetwork topologies. Motivated by real-world datasets, we propose a correlated\nheterogeneous Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible model which assumes that the\ninfection rate $\\beta_{ij}(=\\beta_{ji})$ between node $i$ and $j$ is correlated\nwith the degree of the two end nodes: $\\beta_{ij}=c(d_id_j)^\\alpha$, where\n$\\alpha$ indicates the strength of the correlation and $c$ is selected so that\nthe average infection rate is $1$. In order to understand the effect of such\ncorrelation on epidemic spreading, we consider as well the corresponding\nuncorrected but still heterogeneous infection rate scenario as a reference,\nwhere the original correlated infection rates in our CSIS model are shuffled\nand reallocated to the links of the same network topology. We compare these two\nscenarios in the average fraction of infected nodes in the metastable state on\nErd{\\"o}s-R{\\\'e}nyi (ER) and scale-free (SF) networks with a similar average\ndegree. Through the continuous-time simulations, we find that, when the\nrecovery rate is small, the negative correlation is more likely to help the\nepidemic spread and the positive correlation prohibit the spreading; as the\nrecovery rate increases to be larger than a critical value, the positive but\nnot negative correlation tends to help the spreading. Our findings are further\nanalytically proved in a wheel network (one central node connects with each of\nthe nodes in a ring) and validated on real-world networks with correlated\nheterogeneous interaction frequencies.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07327v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Invariant death', ['Steven A. Frank'], u'2016-08-25', u"In nematodes, environmental or physiological perturbations alter death's\nscaling of time. In human cancer, genetic perturbations alter death's curvature\nof time. Those changes in scale and curvature follow the constraining contours\nof death's invariant geometry. I show that the constraints arise from a\nfundamental extension to the theories of randomness, invariance and scale. A\ngeneralized Gompertz law follows. The constraints imposed by the invariant\nGompertz geometry explain the tendency of perturbations to stretch or bend\ndeath's scaling of time.

[u'Activity Networks with Delays An application to toxicity analysis', ['Franck Delaplace', 'Cinzia Di Giusto', 'Jean-Louis Giavitto', 'Hanna Klaudel'], u'2016-08-26', u'ANDy , Activity Networks with Delays, is a discrete time framework aimed at\nthe qualitative modelling of time-dependent activities. The modular and concise\nsyntax makes ANDy suitable for an easy and natural modelling of time-dependent\nbiological systems (i.e., regulatory pathways). Activities involve entities\nplaying the role of activators, inhibitors or products of biochemical network\noperation. Activities may have given duration, i.e., the time required to\nobtain results. An entity may represent an object (e.g., an agent, a\nbiochemical species or a family of thereof) with a local attribute, a state\ndenoting its level (e.g., concentration, strength). Entities levels may change\nas a result of an activity or may decay gradually as time passes by. The\nsemantics of ANDy is formally given via high-level Petri nets ensuring this way\nsome modularity. As main results we show that ANDy systems have finite state\nrepresentations even for potentially infinite processes and it well adapts to\nthe modelling of toxic behaviours. As an illustration, we present a\nclassification of toxicity properties and give some hints on how they can be\nverified with existing tools on ANDy systems. A small case study on blood\nglucose regulation is provided to exemplify the ANDy framework and the toxicity\nproperties.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07440v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], [u'IBISC', u'Repmus']]
