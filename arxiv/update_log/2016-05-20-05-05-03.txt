[u"Antibiotic resistance: a physicist's view", ['Rosalind Allen', 'Bartlomiej Waclaw'], u'2016-05-19', u'The problem of antibiotic resistance poses challenges across many\ndisciplines. One such challenge is to understand the fundamental science of how\nantibiotics work, and how resistance to them can emerge. This is an area where\nphysicists can make important contributions. Here, we highlight cases where\nthis is already happening, and suggest directions for further physics\ninvolvement in antimicrobial research.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06086v1', ['Populations and Evolution', 'Cell Behavior'], []]
[u'Nonlinear trend removal should be carefully performed in heart rate\n  variability analysis', ['Binbin Xu', 'Remi Dubois', 'Oriol Pont', 'Hussein Yahia'], u'2016-05-19', u"$\\bullet$ Background : In Heart rate variability analysis, the rate-rate time\nseries suffer often from aperiodic non-stationarity, presence of ectopic beats\netc. It would be hard to extract helpful information from the original signals.\n10 $\\bullet$ Problem : Trend removal methods are commonly practiced to reduce\nthe influence of the low frequency and aperiodic non-stationary in RR data.\nThis can unfortunately affect the signal and make the analysis on detrended\ndata less appropriate. $\\bullet$ Objective : Investigate the detrending effect\n(linear \\& nonlinear) in temporal / nonliear analysis of heart rate variability\nof long-term RR data (in normal sinus rhythm, atrial fibrillation, 15\ncongestive heart failure and ventricular premature arrhythmia conditions).\n$\\bullet$ Methods : Temporal method : standard measure SDNN; Nonlinear methods\n: multi-scale Fractal Dimension (FD), Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) \\&\nSample Entropy (Sam-pEn) analysis. $\\bullet$ Results : The linear detrending\naffects little the global characteristics of the RR data, either 20 in temporal\nanalysis or in nonlinear complexity analysis. After linear detrending, the\nSDNNs are just slightly shifted and all distributions are well preserved. The\ncross-scale complexity remained almost the same as the ones for original RR\ndata or correlated. Nonlinear detrending changed not only the SDNNs\ndistribution, but also the order among different types of RR data. After this\nprocessing, the SDNN became indistinguishable be-25 tween SDNN for normal sinus\nrhythm and ventricular premature beats. Different RR data has different\ncomplexity signature. Nonlinear detrending made the all RR data to be similar ,\nin terms of complexity. It is thus impossible to distinguish them. The FD\nshowed that nonlinearly detrended RR data has a dimension close to 2, the\nexponent from DFA is close to zero and SampEn is larger than 1.5 -- these\ncomplexity values are very close to those for 30 random signal. $\\bullet$\nConclusions : Pre-processing by linear detrending can be performed on RR data,\nwhich has little influence on the corresponding analysis. Nonlinear detrending\ncould be harmful and it is not advisable to use this type of pre-processing.\nExceptions do exist, but only combined with other appropriate techniques to\navoid complete change of the signal's intrinsic dynamics. 35 Keywords $\\bullet$\nheart rate variability $\\bullet$ linear / nonlinear detrending $\\bullet$\ncomplexity analysis $\\bullet$ mul-tiscale analysis $\\bullet$ detrended\nfluctuation analysis $\\bullet$ fractal dimension $\\bullet$ sample entropy;", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05891v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], [u'GeoStat']]
[u'Shear-Induced Nitric Oxide Production by Endothelial Cells', ['Krishna Sriram', 'Justin G. Laughlin', 'Padmini Rangamani', 'Daniel M. Tartakovsky'], u'2016-05-19', u'We present a biochemical model of the wall shear stress (WSS)-induced\nactivation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in an endothelial cell\n(EC). The model includes three key mechanotransducers: mechanosensing ion\nchannels, integrins and G-protein-coupled receptors. The reaction cascade\nconsists of two interconnected parts. The first is rapid activation of calcium,\nwhich results in formation of calcium-calmodulin complexes, followed by\nrecruitment of eNOS from caveolae. The second is phosphoryaltion of eNOS by\nprotein kinases PKC and AKT. The model also includes a negative feedback loop\ndue to inhibition of calcium influx into the cell by cyclic guanosine\nmonophosphate (cGMP). In this feedback, increased nitric oxide (NO) levels\ncause an increase in cGMP levels, so that cGMP inhibition of calcium influx can\nlimit NO production. The model was used to predict the dynamics of NO\nproduction by an EC subjected to a step increase of WSS from zero to a finite\nphysiologically relevant value. Among several experimentally observed features,\nthe model predicts a highly nonlinear, biphasic transient behavior of eNOS\nactivation and NO production: a rapid initial activation due to the very rapid\ninflux of calcium into the cytosol (occurring within 1 to 5 minutes) is\nfollowed by a sustained period of activation due to protein kinases.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05804v1', ['Molecular Networks', 'Cell Behavior'], []]
[u'A Possible Mechanism of DNA to DNA Transcription in Eukaryotic Cells :\n  Endonuclease Dependent Transcript Cutout', ['Gao-De Li'], u'2016-05-19', u'We previously proposed the existence of DNA to DNA transcription in\neukaryotic cells, but the mechanism by which single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)\ntranscript is produced and released from the genome remains unknown. We\npreviously speculated that the mechanism of DNA to DNA transcription might be\nsimilar to that of DNA to RNA transcription, but there is another mechanism\nthat we think is most likely to be true. The mechanism is called endonuclease\ndependent transcript cutout, in which a copy of ssDNA fragment (transcript)\nbetween two nicks produced by nicking endonuclease is released from\ndouble-stranded DNA region in the genome by an unknown ssDNA fragment-releasing\nenzyme. The gap in the double-stranded DNA will be filled through DNA repair\nmechanism. Occasionally, multiple copies of ssDNA transcripts might be produced\nthrough multiple rounds of cutout-repair-cutout cycle.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05853v1', ['Subcellular Processes'], []]
