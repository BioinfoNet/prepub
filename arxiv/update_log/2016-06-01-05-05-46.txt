[u'Prediction of allosteric sites and mediating interactions through\n  bond-to-bond propensities', ['Benjamin R. C. Amor', 'Michael T. Schaub', 'Sophia N. Yaliraki', 'Mauricio Barahona'], u'2016-05-31', u'Allosteric regulation is central to many biochemical processes. Allosteric\nsites provide a target to fine-tune protein activity, yet we lack computational\nmethods to predict them. Here, we present an efficient graph-theoretical\napproach for identifying allosteric sites and the mediating interactions that\nconnect them to the active site. Using an atomistic graph with edges weighted\nby covalent and non-covalent bond energies, we obtain a bond-to-bond propensity\nthat quantifies the effect of instantaneous bond fluctuations propagating\nthrough the protein. We use this propensity to detect the sites and\ncommunication pathways most strongly linked to the active site, assessing their\nsignificance through quantile regression and comparison against a reference set\nof 100 generic proteins. We exemplify our method in detail with three\nwell-studied allosteric proteins: caspase-1, CheY, and h-Ras, correctly\npredicting the location of the allosteric site and identifying key allosteric\ninteractions. Consistent prediction of allosteric sites is then attained in a\nfurther set of 17 proteins known to exhibit allostery. Because our propensity\nmeasure runs in almost linear time, it offers a scalable approach to\nhigh-throughput searches for candidate allosteric sites.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09710v1', ['Biomolecules', 'Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Theory on the mechanism of site-specific DNA-protein interactions in the\n  presence of traps', ['G. Niranjani', 'R. Murugan'], u'2016-05-31', u'The speed of site-specific binding of transcription factor (TFs) proteins\nwith genomic DNA seems to be strongly retarded by the randomly occurring\nsequence traps. Traps are those DNA sequences sharing significant similarity\nwith the original specific binding sites. It is an intriguing question how the\nnaturally occurring TFs and their specific binding sites are designed to manage\nthe retarding effects of such randomly occurring traps. We develop a simple\nrandom walk model on the site-specific binding of TFs with genomic DNA in the\npresence of sequence traps. Our dynamical model predicts that (a) the retarding\neffects of traps will be minimum when the traps are arranged around the\nspecific binding site such that there is a negative correlation between the\nbinding strength of TFs with traps and the distance of traps from the specific\nbinding site and (b) the retarding effects of sequence traps can be appeased by\nthe condensed conformational state of DNA. Our computational analysis results\non the distribution of sequence traps around the putative binding sites of\nvarious TFs in mouse and human genome clearly agree well the theoretical\npredictions. We propose that the distribution of traps can be used as an\nadditional metric to efficiently identify the specific binding sites of TFs on\ngenomic DNA.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09489v1', ['Biomolecules', 'Subcellular Processes'], []]

[u'Significant competitive dominance in mid-latitude European plant\n  communities', ['Jose A. Capitan', 'Sara Cuenda', 'Alejandro Ordonez', 'David Alonso'], u'2016-05-31', u'Understanding the main determinants of species coexistence across space and\ntime is a central question in ecology. However, ecologists still know little\nabout the scales and conditions at which biotic interactions matter and their\ninterplay with the environment to structure species assemblages. Here we\ndevelop ecological theory to analyze plant distribution and trait data across\nEurope and find that plant height clustering is related to evapotranspiration\nand gross primary productivity. Our analysis suggests competitive dominance as\na plausible mechanism underlying community assembly patterns over continental\nscales. In particular, we find a clear signal of plant-to-plant competition in\nmid-latitude ecoregions, where conditions for growth (reflected in actual\nevapotranspiration rates and gross primary productivities) are optimal. Under\nsevere conditions, either climate is too harsh and overrides the effect of\ncompetition or other interactions play a relevant role. Our approach bridges\nthe gap between modern coexistence theory and large-scale species distribution\ndata analysis.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09682v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

[u'Disentangling genetic and environmental risk factors for individual\n  diseases from multiplex comorbidity networks', ['Peter Klimek', 'Silke Aichberger', 'Stefan Thurner'], u'2016-05-31', u'Most disorders are caused by a combination of multiple genetic and/or\nenvironmental factors. If two diseases are caused by the same molecular\nmechanism, they tend to co-occur in patients. Here we provide a quantitative\nmethod to disentangle how much genetic or environmental risk factors contribute\nto the pathogenesis of 358 individual diseases, respectively. We pool data on\ngenetic, pathway-based, and toxicogenomic disease-causing mechanisms with\ndisease co-occurrence data obtained from almost two million patients. From this\ndata we construct a multilayer network where nodes represent disorders that are\nconnected by links that either represent phenotypic comorbidity of the patients\nor the involvement of a certain molecular mechanism. From the similarity of\nphenotypic and mechanism-based networks for each disorder we derive measure\nthat allows us to quantify the relative importance of various molecular\nmechanisms for a given disease. We find that most diseases are dominated by\ngenetic risk factors, while environmental influences prevail for disorders such\nas depressions, cancers, or dermatitis. Almost never we find that more than one\ntype of mechanisms is involved in the pathogenesis of diseases.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09535v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
