[u'Bayesian latent structure discovery from multi-neuron recordings', ['Scott W. Linderman', 'Ryan P. Adams', 'Jonathan W. Pillow'], u'2016-10-26', u"Neural circuits contain heterogeneous groups of neurons that differ in type,\nlocation, connectivity, and basic response properties. However, traditional\nmethods for dimensionality reduction and clustering are ill-suited to\nrecovering the structure underlying the organization of neural circuits. In\nparticular, they do not take advantage of the rich temporal dependencies in\nmulti-neuron recordings and fail to account for the noise in neural spike\ntrains. Here we describe new tools for inferring latent structure from\nsimultaneously recorded spike train data using a hierarchical extension of a\nmulti-neuron point process model commonly known as the generalized linear model\n(GLM). Our approach combines the GLM with flexible graph-theoretic priors\ngoverning the relationship between latent features and neural connectivity\npatterns. Fully Bayesian inference via P\\'olya-gamma augmentation of the\nresulting model allows us to classify neurons and infer latent dimensions of\ncircuit organization from correlated spike trains. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method with applications to synthetic data and\nmulti-neuron recordings in primate retina, revealing latent patterns of neural\ntypes and locations from spike trains alone.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08465v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Transfer entropy in continuous time, with applications to jump and\n  neural spiking processes', ['Richard E. Spinney', 'Mikhail Prokopenko', 'Joseph T. Lizier'], u'2016-10-26', u'Transfer entropy has been used to quantify the directed flow of information\nbetween source and target variables in many complex systems. Originally\nformulated in discrete time, we provide a framework for considering transfer\nentropy in continuous time systems. By appealing to a measure theoretic\nformulation we generalise transfer entropy, describing it in terms of\nRadon-Nikodym derivatives between measures of complete path realisations. The\nresulting formalism introduces and emphasises the idea that transfer entropy is\nan expectation of an individually fluctuating quantity along a path, in the\nsame way we consider the expectation of physical quantities such as work and\nheat. We recognise that transfer entropy is a quantity accumulated over a\nfinite time interval, whilst permitting an associated instantaneous transfer\nentropy rate. We use this approach to produce an explicit form for the transfer\nentropy for pure jump processes, and highlight the simplified form in the\nspecific case of point processes (frequently used in neuroscience to model\nneural spike trains). We contrast our approach with previous attempts to\nformulate information flow between continuous time point processes within a\ndiscrete time framework, which incur issues that our continuous time approach\nnaturally avoids. Finally, we present two synthetic spiking neuron model\nexamples to exhibit the pertinent features of our formalism, namely that the\ninformation flow for point processes consists of discontinuous jump\ncontributions (at spikes in the target) interrupting a continuously varying\ncontribution (relating to waiting times between target spikes).', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08192v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Phenotypic heterogeneity in modeling cancer evolution', ['Ali Mahdipour Shirayeh', 'Kamran Kaveh', 'Mohammad Kohandel', 'Siv Sivaloganathan'], u'2016-10-26', u'The unwelcome evolution of malignancy during cancer progression emerges\nthrough a selection process in a complex heterogeneous population structure. In\nthe present work, we investigate evolutionary dynamics in a phenotypically\nheterogeneous population of stem cells (SCs) and their associated progenitors.\nThe fate of a malignant mutation is determined not only by overall stem cell\nand differentiated cell growth rates but also differentiation and\ndedifferentiation rates. We investigate the effect of such a complex population\nstructure on the evolution of malignant mutations. We derive exact analytic\nresults for the fixation probability of a mutant arising in each of the\nsubpopulations. The analytic results are in almost perfect agreement with the\nnumerical simulations. Moreover, a condition for evolutionary advantage of a\nmutant cell versus the wild type population is given in the present study. We\nalso show that microenvironment-induced plasticity in invading mutants leads to\nmore aggressive mutants with higher fixation probability. Our model predicts\nthat decreasing polarity between stem and differentiated cells turnover would\nraise the survivability of non-plastic mutants; while it would suppress the\ndevelopment of malignancy for plastic mutants. We discuss our model in the\ncontext of colorectal/intestinal cancer (at the epithelium). This novel\nmathematical framework can be applied more generally to a variety of problems\nconcerning selection in heterogeneous populations, in other contexts such as\npopulation genetics, and ecology.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08163v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Online Bayesian phylogenetic inference: theoretical foundations via\n  Sequential Monte Carlo', ['Vu Dinh', 'Aaron E. Darling', 'Frederick A. Matsen IV'], u'2016-10-26', u'Phylogenetics, the inference of evolutionary trees from molecular sequence\ndata such as DNA, is an enterprise that yields valuable evolutionary\nunderstanding of many biological systems. Bayesian phylogenetic algorithms,\nwhich approximate a posterior distribution on trees, have become a popular if\ncomputationally expensive means of doing phylogenetics. Modern data collection\ntechnologies are quickly adding new sequences to already substantial databases.\nWith all current techniques for Bayesian phylogenetics, computation must start\nanew each time a sequence becomes available, making it costly to maintain an\nup-to-date estimate of a phylogenetic posterior. These considerations highlight\nthe need for an \\emph{online} Bayesian phylogenetic method which can update an\nexisting posterior with new sequences.\n  Here we provide theoretical results on the consistency and stability of\nmethods for online Bayesian phylogenetic inference based on Sequential Monte\nCarlo (SMC) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). We first show a consistency\nresult, demonstrating that the method samples from the correct distribution in\nthe limit of a large number of particles. Next we derive the first reported set\nof bounds on how phylogenetic likelihood surfaces change when new sequences are\nadded. These bounds enable us to characterize the theoretical performance of\nsampling algorithms by bounding the effective sample size (ESS) with a given\nnumber of particles from below. We show that the ESS is guaranteed to grow\nlinearly as the number of particles in an SMC sampler grows. Surprisingly, this\nresult holds even though the dimensions of the phylogenetic model grow with\neach new added sequence.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08148v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

[u'MELA: Modelling in Ecology with Location Attributes', ['Ludovica Luisa Vissat', 'Jane Hillston', 'Glenn Marion', 'Matthew J. Smith'], u'2016-10-26', u'Ecology studies the interactions between individuals, species and the\nenvironment. The ability to predict the dynamics of ecological systems would\nsupport the design and monitoring of control strategies and would help to\naddress pressing global environmental issues. It is also important to plan for\nefficient use of natural resources and maintenance of critical ecosystem\nservices. The mathematical modelling of ecological systems often includes\nnontrivial specifications of processes that influence the birth, death,\ndevelopment and movement of individuals in the environment, that take into\naccount both biotic and abiotic interactions. To assist in the specification of\nsuch models, we introduce MELA, a process algebra for Modelling in Ecology with\nLocation Attributes. Process algebras allow the modeller to describe concurrent\nsystems in a high-level language. A key feature of concurrent systems is that\nthey are composed of agents that can progress simultaneously but also interact\n- a good match to ecological systems. MELA aims to provide ecologists with a\nstraightforward yet flexible tool for modelling ecological systems, with\nparticular emphasis on the description of space and the environment. Here we\npresent four example MELA models, illustrating the different spatial\narrangements which can be accommodated and demonstrating the use of MELA in\nepidemiological and predator-prey scenarios.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08171v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
