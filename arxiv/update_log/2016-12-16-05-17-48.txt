[u'Interaction graph estimation for the first olfactory relay of an insect', ['Ludmila Brochini', 'Pierre Hodara', 'Christophe Pouzat', 'Antonio Galves'], u'2016-12-15', u'We consider the model of interacting neurons proposed in [8] and use the statistical selection procedure proposed in [4] to infer the interaction graph from observed neural activity (spike trains) of the first olfactory relay of an insect. We propose a pruning method to deal with small sample sizes. We use simulations to test the efficiency of the estimator and to fix the parameters involved in its construction. We then use these parameters to analyze actual data recorded from the locust (Schistocerca americana) antennal lobe. In order to test the performance of the proposed estimator on our spike train data, the data set is split in two parts and the resulting connection graphs are compared.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05226v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Modelling selection via multiple ancestors', ['Adrian Gonzalez Casanova', 'Dario Spano'], u'2016-12-15', u"A two-types, discrete-time population model with finite, constant size is constructed, allowing for a general form of frequency-dependent selection and skewed offspring distribution. Selection is defined based on the idea that individuals first choose a (random) number of $\\textit{potential}$ parents from the previous generation and then, from the selected pool, they inherit the type of the fittest parent. The probability distribution function of the number of potential parents per individual thus parametrises entirely the selection mechanism. Using sampling- and moment-duality, weak convergence is then proved both for the allele frequency process of the selectively weak type and for the population's ancestral process. The scaling limits are, respectively, a two-types $\\Xi$-Fleming-Viot jump-diffusion process with frequency-dependent selection, and a branching-coalescing process with general branching and simultaneous multiple collisions. Duality also leads to a characterisation of the probability of extinction of the selectively weak allele, in terms of the ancestral process' ergodic properties.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.04947v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Introducing Gaussian covariance graph models in genome-wide prediction', ['Carlos Alberto Martinez', 'Kshitij Khare', 'Syed Rahman', 'Mauricio A. Elzo'], u'2016-12-14', u'Several statistical models used in genome-wide prediction assume independence of marker allele substitution effects, but it is known that these effects might be correlated. In statistics, graphical models have been identified as a useful tool for covariance estimation in high dimensional problems and it is an area that has recently experienced a great expansion. In Gaussian covariance graph models (GCovGM), the joint distribution of a set of random variables is assumed to be Gaussian and the pattern of zeros of the covariance matrix is encoded in terms of an undirected graph G. In this study, methods adapting the theory of GCovGM to genome-wide prediction were developed (Bayes GCov, Bayes GCov-KR and Bayes GCov-H). In simulated and real datasets, improvements in correlation between phenotypes and predicted breeding values and accuracies of predicted breeding values were found. Our models account for correlation of marker effects and permit to accommodate general structures as opposed to models proposed in previous studies which consider spatial correlation only. In addition, they allow incorporation of biological information in the prediction process through its use when constructing graph G, and their extension to the multiallelic loci case is straightforward.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.04873v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u"Investigation of a Structured Fisher's Equation with Applications in Biochemistry", ['John T. Nardini', 'D. M. Bortz'], u'2016-12-15', u"Recent biological research has sought to understand how biochemical signaling pathways, such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family, influence the migration of a population of cells during wound healing. Fisher's Equation has been used extensively to model experimental wound healing assays due to its simple nature and known traveling wave solutions. This partial differential equation with independent variables of time and space cannot account for the effects of biochemical activity on wound healing, however. To this end, we derive a structured Fisher's Equation with independent variables of time, space, and biochemical pathway activity level and prove the existence of a self-similar traveling wave solution to this equation. We also consider a more complicated model with different phenotypes based on MAPK activation and numerically investigate how various temporal patterns of biochemical activity can lead to increased and decreased rates of population migration.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05188v1', ['Cell Behavior'], []]
[u'Weakly coupled map lattice models for multicellular patterning and collective normalization of abnormal single-cell states', ['Vladimir Garcia-Morales', 'Jose A. Manzanares', 'Salvador Mafe'], u'2016-12-15', u"We present a weakly coupled map lattice model for patterning that explores the effects exerted by weakening the local dynamic rules on model biological and artificial networks composed of two-state building blocks (cells). To this end, we use two cellular automata models based on: (i) a smooth majority rule (model I) and (ii) a set of rules similar to those of Conway's Game of Life (model II). The normal and abnormal cell states evolve according with local rules that are modulated by a parameter $\\kappa$. This parameter quantifies the effective weakening of the prescribed rules due to the limited coupling of each cell to its neighborhood and can be experimentally controlled by appropriate external agents. The emergent spatio-temporal maps of single-cell states should be of significance for positional information processes as well as for intercellular communication in tumorigenesis where the collective normalization of abnormal single-cell states by a predominantly normal neighborhood may be crucial.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05006v1', ['Cell Behavior'], []]
