[u'Computer Folding of RNA Tetraloops: Identification of Key Force Field\n  Deficiencies', ['Petra Kuhrova', 'Robert B. Best', 'Sandro Bottaro', 'Giovanni Bussi', 'Jiri Sponer', 'Michal Otyepka', 'Pavel Banas'], u'2016-09-27', u"The computer-aided folding of biomolecules, particularly RNAs, is one of the\nmost difficult challenges in computational structural biology. RNA tetraloops\nare fundamental RNA motifs playing key roles in RNA folding and RNA-RNA and\nRNA-protein interactions. Although state-of-the-art Molecular Dynamics (MD)\nforce fields correctly describe the native state of these tetraloops as a\nstable free-energy basin on the microsecond time scale, enhanced sampling\ntechniques reveal that the native state is not the global free energy minimum,\nsuggesting yet unidentified significant imbalances in the force fields. Here,\nwe tested our ability to fold the RNA tetraloops in various force fields and\nsimulation settings. We employed three different enhanced sampling techniques,\nnamely, temperature replica exchange MD (T-REMD), replica exchange with solute\ntempering (REST2), and well-tempered metadynamics (WT-MetaD). We aimed to\nseparate problems caused by limited sampling from those due to force-field\ninaccuracies. We found that none of the contemporary force fields is able to\ncorrectly describe folding of the 5'-GAGA-3' tetraloop over a range of\nsimulation conditions. We thus aimed to identify which terms of the force field\nare responsible for this poor description of TL folding. We showed that at\nleast two different imbalances contribute to this behavior, namely,\noverstabilization of base-phosphate and/or sugar-phosphate interactions and\nunderestimated stability of the hydrogen bonding interaction in base pairing.\nThe first artifact stabilizes the unfolded ensemble, while the second one\ndestabilizes the folded state. The former problem might be partially alleviated\nby reparametrization of the van der Waals parameters of the phosphate oxygens\nsuggested by Case et al., while in order to overcome the latter effect we\nsuggest local potentials to better capture hydrogen bonding interactions.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08276v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Random-phase-approximation theory for sequence-dependent, biologically\n  functional liquid-liquid phase separation of intrinsically disordered\n  proteins', ['Yi-Hsuan Lin', 'Jianhui Song', 'Julie D. Forman-Kay', 'Hue Sun Chan'], u'2016-09-26', u'Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are typically low in\nnonpolar/hydrophobic but relatively high in polar, charged, and aromatic amino\nacid compositions. Some IDPs undergo liquid-liquid phase separation in the\naqueous milieu of the living cell. The resulting phase with enhanced IDP\nconcentration can function as a major component of membraneless organelles\nthat, by creating their own IDP-rich microenvironments, stimulate critical\nbiological functions. IDP phase behaviors are governed by their amino acid\nsequences. To make progress in understanding this sequence-phase relationship,\nwe report further advances in a recently introduced application of\nrandom-phase-approximation (RPA) heteropolymer theory to account for\nsequence-specific electrostatics in IDP phase separation. Here we examine\ncomputed variations in phase behavior with respect to block length and charge\ndensity of model polyampholytes of alternating equal-length charge blocks to\ngain insight into trends observed in IDP phase separation. As a real-life\nexample, the theory is applied to rationalize/predict binodal and spinodal\nphase behaviors of the 236-residue N-terminal disordered region of RNA helicase\nDdx4 and its charge-scrambled mutant for which experimental data are available.\nFundamental differences are noted between the phase diagrams predicted by RPA\nand those predicted by mean-field Flory-Huggins and\nOverbeek-Voorn/Debye-H\\"uckel theories. In the RPA context, a physically\nplausible dependence of relative permittivity on protein concentration can\nproduce a cooperative effect in favor of IDP-IDP attraction and thus a\nsignificant increased tendency to phase separate. Ramifications of these\nfindings for future development of IDP phase separation theory are discussed.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08205v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Synchronization through time-shifted shared inputs', ['Ehsan Bolhasani', 'Yousef Azizi', 'Alireza Valizadeh'], u'2016-09-27', u'When oscillators in a population receive signal from common sources, their\ninputs will be statistically correlated which can result to synchronization of\nthe oscillators. In real physical and biological systems finite speed of the\nsignal transmission might result in the correlation of non-zero lags between\ninputs if the target oscillators are of different distance from the common\nsources. In this study we show that how presence of non-zero lags correlation\nbetween the stochastic inputs of two limit-cycle oscillators affects their\nrelative phase. We show that the lag in the shared inputs can be formulated as\nthe delay in the coupling terms and this in turn leads to nontrivial results\nwhen the neurons are coupled by direct connections and the neurons receive\ncommon stochastic inputs with a non-zero time shift.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08320v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Complexity Leads to Simplicity: A Consensus Layer V Pyramidal Neuron Can\n  Sustain Interpulse-Interval Coding', ['Chandan Singh', 'William B. Levy'], u'2016-09-26', u'In terms of the long-distance communication of a single neuron, interpulse\nintervals (IPIs) are a possible alternative to rate and binary codes. As a\nproxy for IPI, the time-to-spike (TTS) for a neuron can be found in the\nbiophysical and experimental literature. Using the current, consensus layer V\npyramidal neuron, the present study examines the feasibility of IPI-coding and\nexamines the noise sources that limit the information rate of such an encoding.\nIn descending order of noise intensity, the noise sources are (i) synaptic\nvariability, (ii) sodium channel shot-noise, followed by (iii) thermal noise\nwith synaptic noise much greater than the sodium channel-noise. More\nimportantly, the biophysical model demonstrates a linear relationship between\ninput intensity and inverse TTS. This linear observation contradicts the\nassumption that a neuron should be treated as a passive, electronic circuit (an\nRC circuit, as in the Stein model). Finally, the biophysical simulations allow\nthe calculation of mutual information, which is about 3.0 bits/spike.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08213v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

Martinez'], u'2016-09-27', u'The susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) agent-based model is usually\nemployed in the investigation of epidemics. The model describes a Markov\nprocess for a single communicable disease among susceptible (S) and infected\n(I) agents. However, the disease spreading forecasting is often restricted to\nnumerical simulations, while analytic formulations lack both general results\nand perturbative approaches since they are subjected to asymmetric time\ngenerators.

[u'Stochastic epidemic dynamics on extremely heterogeneous networks', ['Cesar Parra-Rojas', 'Thomas House', 'Alan J. McKane'], u'2016-09-27', u'Networks of contacts capable of spreading infectious diseases are often\nobserved to be highly heterogeneous, with the majority of individuals having\nfewer contacts than the mean, and a significant minority having relatively very\nmany contacts. We derive a two-dimensional diffusion model for the full\ntemporal behavior of the stochastic susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR)\nmodel on such a network, by making use of a time-scale separation in the\ndeterministic limit of the dynamics. This low-dimensional process is an\naccurate approximation to the full model in the limit of large populations,\neven for cases when the time-scale separation is not too pronounced, provided\nthe maximum degree is not of the order of the population size.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08450v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

Within a perturbation analysis of the model from the\ninfinite mixing rate, we provide analytical evidence that extinction occurs\ndeterministically at sufficiently large but finite values of the mixing rate\nfor any odd species numbers. Further, we discuss numerical results concerning\nthe trajectories toward such deterministic extinction, including bifurcations,\nin more general cases.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08297v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'A data-driven model for influenza transmission incorporating media\n  effects', ['Lewis Mitchell', 'Joshua V. Ross'], u'2016-09-27', u'Numerous studies have attempted to model the effect of mass media on the\ntransmission of diseases such as influenza, however quantitative data on media\nengagement has until recently been difficult to obtain. With the recent\nexplosion of "big data" coming from online social media and the like, large\nvolumes of data on a population\'s engagement with mass media during an epidemic\nare becoming available to researchers. In this study we combine an online data\nset comprising millions of shared messages relating to influenza with\ntraditional surveillance data on flu activity to suggest a functional form for\nthe relationship between the two. Using this data we present a simple\ndeterministic model for influenza dynamics incorporating media effects, and\nshow that such a model helps explain the dynamics of historical influenza\noutbreaks. Furthermore, through model selection we show that the proposed media\nfunction fits historical data better than other media functions proposed in\nearlier studies.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08283v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

[u'Drawing a Waddington landscape to capture dynamic epigenetics', ['Floriane Nicol-Benoit', 'Pascale le Goff', 'Denis Michel'], u'2016-09-27', u'Epigenetics is most often reduced to chromatin marking in the current\nliterature, whereas this notion was initially defined in a more general\ncontext. This restricted view ignores that epigenetic memories are in fact more\nrobustly ensured in living systems by steady state mechanisms with permanent\nmolecule renewal. This misconception is likely to result from misleading\nintuitions and insufficient dialogues between traditional and quantitative\nbiologists. To demystify dynamic epigenetics, its most famous image, a\nWaddington landscape and its attractors, are explicitly drawn. The simple\nexample provided is sufficient to highlight the main requirements and\ncharacteristics of dynamic gene networks, underlying cellular differentiation,\nde-differentiation and trans-differentiation.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08331v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
[u'Conformational selection or induced fit? New insights from old\n  principles', ['Denis Michel'], u'2016-09-27', u'A long standing debate in biochemistry is to determine whether the\nconformational changes observed during biomolecular interactions proceed\nthrough conformational selection (of preexisting isoforms) or induced fit\n(ligand-induced 3D reshaping). The latter mechanism had been invoked in certain\ncircumstances, for example to explain the non-Michaelian activity of monomeric\nenzymes like glucokinase. But the relative importance of induced fit has been\nrecently depreciated in favor of conformational selection, assumed to be always\nsufficient, predominant in general and in particular for glucokinase. The\nrelative contributions of conformational selection and induced fit are\nreconsidered here in and out of equilibrium, in the light of earlier concepts\nsuch as the cyclic equilibrium rule and the turning wheel of Wyman, using\nsingle molecule state probability, one way fluxes and net fluxes. The\nconditions for a switch from conformational selection to induced fit at a given\nligand concentration are explicitly determined. Out of equilibrium, the\ninspection of the enzyme states circuit shows that conformational selection\nalone would give a Michaelian reaction rate but not the established nonlinear\nbehaviour of glucokinase. Moreover, when induced fit and conformational\nselection coexist and allow kinetic cooperativity, the net flux emerging in the\nlinkage cycle necessarily corresponds to the induced fit path.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08318v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
[u'The accuracy of biochemical interactions is ensured by endothermic\n  stepwise kinetics', ['Denis Michel', 'Benjamin Boutin', 'Philippe Ruelle'], u'2016-09-27', u'The discerning behavior of living systems relies on accurate interactions\nselected from the lot of molecular collisions occurring in the cell. To ensure\nthe reliability of interactions, binding partners are classically envisioned as\nfinely preadapted molecules, evolutionarily selected on the basis of their\naffinity in one-step associations. But the counterselection of inappropriate\ninteractions can in fact be much more efficiently obtained through difficult\nmulti-step adjustment, whose final high energy state is locked by a fluctuation\nratchet. The progressive addition of molecular bonds during stereo-adjustment\ncan be modeled as a predominantly backward random walk whose first arrival is\nfrozen by a micro-irreversible transition. A new criterion of ligand\nspecificity is presented, that is based on the ratio rejection/incorporation.\nIn addition to its role in the selectivity of interactions, this generic recipe\ncan underlie other important biological phenomena such as the regular synthesis\nat low level of supramolecular complexes, monostable kinetic bimodality,\nsubstrate concentration thresholds or the preparation of rapidly\ndepolymerizable structureswith stored energy, like microtubules.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08310v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
