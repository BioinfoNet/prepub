[u'Entropic formulation for the protein folding process: hydrophobic\n  stability correlates with folding rates', ['J. P. Dal Molin', 'A. Caliri'], u'2016-07-26', u'We assume that the protein folding process follows two autonomous steps: the\nconformational search for the native, mainly ruled by the hydrophobic effect;\nand, the final adjustment stage, which eventually gives stability to the\nnative. Our main tool of investigation is a 3D lattice model provided with a\nten-letter alphabet, the stereochemical model. This model was conceived for\nMonte Carlo (MC) simulations when one keeps in mind the kinetic behavior of\nprotein-like chains in solution. In order to characterize the folding\ncharacteristic time ({\\tau}) by two distinct sampling methods, first we present\ntwo sets of 10^{3} MC simulations for a fast protein-like sequence. For these\nsets of folding times, {\\tau} and {\\tau}_{q} were obtained with the application\nof the standard Metropolis algorithm (MA), and a modified algorithm (M_{q}A).\nThe results for {\\tau}_{q}reveal two things: i) the hydrophobic chain-solvent\ninteractions plus a set of inter-residues steric constraints are enough to\nemulate the first stage of the process: for each one of the 10^{3} MC performed\nsimulations, the native is always found without exception, ii) the ratio\n{\\tau}_{q}/{\\tau}~1/3 suggests that the effect of local thermal fluctuations,\nencompassed by the Tsallis weight, provides an innate efficiency to the chain\nescapes from energetic and steric traps. ...', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.07809v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Generalization of the Ewens sampling formula to arbitrary fitness\n  landscapes', ['Pavel Khromov', 'Constantin D. Malliaris', 'Alexandre V. Morozov'], u'2016-07-25', u'In considering evolution of transcribed regions, regulatory modules, and\nother genomic loci of interest, we are often faced with a situation in which\nthe number of allelic states greatly exceeds the population size. In this\nlimit, the population eventually adopts a steady state characterized by\nmutation-selection-drift balance. Although new alleles continue to be explored\nthrough mutation, the statistics of the population, and in particular the\nprobabilities of seeing specific allelic configurations in samples taken from a\npopulation, do not change with time. In the absence of selection, probabilities\nof allelic configurations are given by the Ewens sampling formula, widely used\nin population genetics to detect deviations from neutrality. Here we develop an\nextension of this formula to arbitrary, possibly epistatic, fitness landscapes.\nAlthough our approach is general, we focus on the class of landscapes in which\nalleles are grouped into two, three, or several fitness states. This class of\nlandscapes yields sampling probabilities that are computationally more\ntractable, and can form a basis for the inference of selection signatures from\nsequence data. We demonstrate that, for a sizeable range of mutation rates and\nselection coefficients, the steady-state allelic diversity is not neutral.\nTherefore, it may be used to infer selection coefficients, as well as other key\nevolutionary parameters, using high-throughput sequencing of evolving\npopulations to collect data on locus polymorphisms. We also find that our\ntheory remains sufficiently accurate even if the assumptions such as the\ninfinite allele limit and the "full connectivity" assumption in which each\nallele can mutate into any other allele are relaxed. Thus, our framework\nestablishes a theoretical foundation for inferring selection signatures from\nsamples of sequences produced by evolution on epistatic fitness landscapes.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.07474v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

Wu', 'Benny Chung-Ying Zee', 'Maggie Haitian Wang'], u'2016-07-26', u'Advancement in sequencing technology enables the study of association between\ncomplex disorders and rare variants with low minor allele frequencies. One of\nthe major challenges in rare variant testing is lack of statistical power of\ntraditional testing methods due to extremely low variances of single nucleotide\npolymorphisms. In this paper, we introduce a W-test collapsing method that\nevaluates the distributional differences in cases and controls using a combined\nlog of odds ratio. The proposed method is compared with the Weighted-Sum\nStatistic and Sequence Kernel Association Test using simulation data sets and\nshowed better performances and faster computing speed. In the study of real\nnext generation sequencing data set of hypertensive disorder, we identified\ngenes of interesting biological functions that are associated to metabolism\ndisorder and inflammation, which include the MACROD1, NLRP7, AGK, PAK6 and\nAPBB1.

[u'Genomic data analysis in tree spaces', ['Sakellarios Zairis', 'Hossein Khiabanian', 'Andrew J. Blumberg', 'Raul Rabadan'], u'2016-07-25', u"Recently, an elegant approach in phylogenetics was introduced by\nBillera-Holmes-Vogtmann that allows a systematic comparison of different\nevolutionary histories using the metric geometry of tree spaces. In many\nproblem settings one encounters heavily populated phylogenetic trees, where the\nlarge number of leaves encumbers visualization and analysis in the relevant\nevolutionary moduli spaces. To address this issue, we introduce tree\ndimensionality reduction, a structured approach to reducing large phylogenetic\ntrees to a distribution of smaller trees. We prove a stability theorem ensuring\nthat small perturbations of the large trees are taken to small perturbations of\nthe resulting distributions.\n  We then present a series of four biologically motivated applications to the\nanalysis of genomic data, spanning cancer and infectious disease. The first\nquantifies how chemotherapy can disrupt the evolution of common leukemias. The\nsecond examines a link between geometric information and the histologic grade\nin relapsed gliomas, where longer relapse branches were specific to high grade\nglioma. The third concerns genetic stability of xenograft models of cancer,\nwhere heterogeneity at the single cell level increased with later mouse\npassages. The last studies genetic diversity in seasonal influenza A virus. We\napply tree dimensionality reduction to 24 years of longitudinally collected\nH3N2 hemagglutinin sequences, generating distributions of smaller trees\nspanning between three and five seasons. A negative correlation is observed\nbetween the influenza vaccine effectiveness during a season and the variance of\nthe distributions produced using preceding seasons' sequence data. We also show\nhow tree distributions relate to antigenic clusters and choice of influenza\nvaccine. Our formalism exposes links between viral genomic data and clinical\nobservables such as vaccine selection and efficacy.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.07503v1', ['Quantitative Methods', 'Genomics'], []]

[u'Computational fluid dynamics modelling of left valvular heart diseases\n  during atrial fibrillation', ['Stefania Scarsoglio', 'Andrea Saglietto', 'Fiorenzo Gaita', 'Luca Ridolfi', 'Matteo Anselmino'], u'2016-07-26', u'Although atrial fibrillation (AF), a common arrhythmia, frequently presents\nin patients with underlying valvular disease, its hemodynamic contributions are\nnot fully understood. The present work aimed to computationally study how\nphysical conditions imposed by pathologic valvular anatomy act on AF\nhemodynamics. We simulated AF with different severity grades of left-sided\nvalvular diseases and compared the cardiovascular effects that they exert\nduring AF, compared to lone AF. The fluid dynamics model used here has been\nrecently validated for lone AF and relies on a lumped parameterization of the\nfour heart chambers, together with the systemic and pulmonary circulation.\nThree different grades of severity (mild, moderate, severe) were analyzed for\neach of the four valvulopathies (aortic stenosis, mitral stenosis, aortic\nregurgitation, mitral regurgitation). Regurgitation was hemodynamically more\nrelevant than stenosis, as the latter led to inefficient cardiac flow, while\nthe former introduced more drastic fluid dynamics variation. Moreover, mitral\nvalvulopathies were more significant than aortic ones. In case of aortic valve\ndiseases, proper mitral functioning damps out changes at atrial and pulmonary\nlevels. In the case of mitral valvulopathy, the mitral valve lost its\nregulating capability, thus hemodynamic variations almost equally affected\nregions upstream and downstream of the valve. The present study revealed that\nboth mitral and aortic regurgitation strongly affect hemodynamics, followed by\nmitral stenosis, while aortic stenosis has the least impact among the analyzed\nvalvular diseases. The proposed approach can provide new mechanistic insights\nas to which valvular pathologies merit more aggressive treatment of AF. Present\nfindings, if clinically confirmed, hold the potential to impact AF management\n(e.g., adoption of a rhythm control strategy) in specific valvular diseases.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.07608v1', ['Tissues and Organs'], []]
[u'Test Models for Statistical Inference: Two-Dimensional Reaction Systems\n  Displaying Limit Cycle Bifurcations and Bistability', ['Tomislav Plesa', 'Tomas Vejchodsky', 'Radek Erban'], u'2016-07-26', u'Theoretical results regarding two-dimensional ordinary-differential equations\n(ODEs) with second-degree polynomial right-hand sides are summarized, with a\nfocus on multistability, limit cycles and limit cycle bifurcations. The results\nare then used for construction of two reaction systems, which are at the\ndeterministic level described by two-dimensional third-degree kinetic ODEs. The\nfirst system displays a homoclinic bifurcation, and a coexistence of a stable\ncritical point and a stable limit cycle in the phase plane. The second system\ndisplays a multiple limit cycle bifurcation, and a coexistence of two stable\nlimit cycles. The deterministic solutions (obtained by solving the kinetic\nODEs) and stochastic solutions (obtained by generating noisy time-series using\nthe Gillespie algorithm) of the constructed systems are compared, and the\nobserved differences highlighted. The constructed systems are proposed as test\nproblems for statistical methods, which are designed to detect and classify\nproperties of given noisy time-series arising from biological applications.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.07738v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
[u'Delineating Parameter Unidentifiabilities in Complex Models', ['Dhruva V. Raman', 'James Anderson', 'Antonis Papachristodoulou'], u'2016-07-26', u'Scientists use mathematical modelling to understand and predict the\nproperties of complex physical systems. In highly parameterised models there\noften exist relationships between parameters over which model predictions are\nidentical, or nearly so. These are known as structural or practical\nunidentifiabilities, respectively. They are hard to diagnose and make reliable\nparameter estimation from data impossible. They furthermore imply the existence\nof an underlying model simplification. We describe a scalable method for\ndetecting unidentifiabilities, and the functional relations defining them, for\ngeneric models. This allows for model simplification, and appreciation of which\nparameters (or functions thereof) cannot be estimated from data. Our algorithm\ncan identify features such as redundant mechanisms and fast timescale\nsubsystems, as well as the regimes in which such approximations are valid. We\nbase our algorithm on a novel quantification of regional parametric\nsensitivity: multiscale sloppiness. Traditionally, the link between parametric\nsensitivity and the conditioning of the parameter estimation problem is made\nlocally, through the Fisher Information Matrix. This is valid in the regime of\ninfinitesimal measurement uncertainty. We demonstrate the duality between\nmultiscale sloppiness and the geometry of confidence regions surrounding\nparameter estimates made where measurement uncertainty is non-negligible.\nFurther theoretical relationships are provided linking multiscale sloppiness to\nthe Likelihood-ratio test. From this, we show that a local sensitivity analysis\n(as typically done) is insufficient for determining the reliability of\nparameter estimation, even with simple (non)linear systems. Our algorithm\nprovides a tractable alternative. We finally apply our methods to a\nlarge-scale, benchmark Systems Biology model of NF-$\\kappa$B, uncovering\npreviously unknown unidentifiabilities.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.07705v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
