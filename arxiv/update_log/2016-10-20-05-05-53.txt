[u'Reducing the Central Fixation Bias in Scene Viewing', ['Lars Oliver Martin Rothkegel', 'Hans Arne Trukenbrod', 'Heiko Herbert Schutt', 'Felix Anton Wichmann', 'Ralf Engbert'], u'2016-10-19', u"When watching a natural scene on a computer screen, observers initially move\ntheir eyes towards the center of the image - an experimental finding termed\ncentral fixation bias (CFB). This systematic tendency in eye guidance masks\nattentional selection driven by image properties or top-down cognitive\nprocesses. Here we show that the CFB can be reduced by delaying the initial\nsaccade relative to image onset. In two scene-viewing experiments, we\nmanipulated observers' initial gaze positions and delayed their first saccades\nby a specific time interval after onset of the image. We analyzed the distance\nto image center over time and demonstrate that the CFB of initial fixations was\nsignificantly reduced with this design. We expect that eye-movement data with a\nreduced CFB provide a better test for models of visual attention in scene\nviewing.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05982v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Making brain-machine interfaces robust to future neural variability', ['David Sussillo', 'Sergey D. Stavisky', 'Jonathan C. Kao', 'Stephen I. Ryu', 'Krishna V. Shenoy'], u'2016-10-19', u'A major hurdle to clinical translation of brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) is\nthat current decoders, which are trained from a small quantity of recent data,\nbecome ineffective when neural recording conditions subsequently change. We\ntested whether a decoder could be made more robust to future neural variability\nby training it to handle a variety of recording conditions sampled from months\nof previously collected data as well as synthetic training data perturbations.\nWe developed a new multiplicative recurrent neural network BMI decoder that\nsuccessfully learned a large variety of neural-to- kinematic mappings and\nbecame more robust with larger training datasets. When tested with a non-human\nprimate preclinical BMI model, this decoder was robust under conditions that\ndisabled a state-of-the-art Kalman filter based decoder. These results validate\na new BMI strategy in which accumulated data history is effectively harnessed,\nand may facilitate reliable daily BMI use by reducing decoder retraining\ndowntime.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05872v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Puzzles in modern biology. IV. Neurodegeneration, localized origin and\n  widespread decay', ['Steven A. Frank'], u'2016-10-19', u'The motor neuron disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) typically begins\nwith localized muscle weakness. Progressive, widespread paralysis often follows\nover a few years. Does the disease begin with local changes in a small piece of\nneural tissue and then spread? Or does neural decay happen independently across\ndiverse spatial locations? The distinction matters, because local initiation\nmay arise by local changes in a tissue microenvironment, by somatic mutation,\nor by various epigenetic or regulatory fluctuations in a few cells. A local\ntrigger must be coupled with a mechanism for spread. By contrast, independent\ndecay across spatial locations cannot begin by a local change, but must depend\non some global predisposition or spatially distributed change that leads to\napproximately synchronous decay. This article outlines the conceptual frame by\nwhich one contrasts local triggers and spread versus parallel spatially\ndistributed decay. Various neurodegenerative diseases differ in their\nmechanistic details, but all can usefully be understood as falling along a\ncontinuum of interacting local and global processes. Cancer provides an example\nof disease progression by local triggers and spatial spread, setting a\nconceptual basis for clarifying puzzles in neurodegeneration. Heart disease\nalso has crucial interactions between global processes, such as circulating\nlipid levels, and local processes in the development of atherosclerotic\nplaques. The distinction between local and global processes helps to understand\nthese various age-related diseases.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06128v1', ['Populations and Evolution', 'Tissues and Organs', 'Molecular Networks'], []]
[u'Puzzles in modern biology. III. Two kinds of causality in age-related\n  disease', ['Steven A. Frank'], u'2016-10-19', u'The two primary causal dimensions of age-related disease are rate and\nfunction. Change in rate of disease development shifts the age of onset. Change\nin physiological function provides necessary steps in disease progression. A\ncausal factor may alter the rate of physiological change, but that causal\nfactor itself may have no direct physiological role. Alternatively, a causal\nfactor may provide a necessary physiological function, but that causal factor\nitself may not alter the rate of disease onset. The rate-function duality\nprovides the basis for solving puzzles of age-related disease. Causal factors\nof cancer illustrate the duality between rate processes of discovery, such as\nsomatic mutation, and necessary physiological functions, such as invasive\npenetration across tissue barriers. Examples from cancer suggest general\nprinciples of age-related disease.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06127v1', ['Populations and Evolution', 'Tissues and Organs', 'Molecular Networks'], []]

[u'phylodyn: an R package for phylodynamic simulation and inference', ['Michael D. Karcher', 'Julia A. Palacios', 'Shiwei Lan', 'Vladimir N. Minin'], u'2016-10-18', u'We introduce phylodyn, an R package for phylodynamic analysis based on gene\ngenealogies. The package main functionality is Bayesian nonparametric\nestimation of effective population size fluctuations over time. Our\nimplementation includes several Markov chain Monte Carlo-based methods and an\nintegrated nested Laplace approximation-based approach for phylodynamic\ninference that have been developed in recent years. Genealogical data describe\nthe timed ancestral relationships of individuals sampled from a population of\ninterest. Here, individuals are assumed to be sampled at the same point in time\n(isochronous sampling) or at different points in time (heterochronous\nsampling); in addition, sampling events can be modeled with preferential\nsampling, which means that the intensity of sampling events is allowed to\ndepend on the effective population size trajectory. We assume the coalescent\nand the sequentially Markov coalescent processes as generative models of\ngenealogies. We include several coalescent simulation functions that are useful\nfor testing our phylodynamics methods via simulation studies. We compare the\nperformance and outputs of various methods implemented in phylodyn and outline\ntheir strengths and weaknesses.

[u'Comparative Salt Tolerance Study of Some Acacia Species at Seed\n  Germination Stage', ['Khalil Cherifi', 'El Houssein Boufous', 'Hassan Boubaker', 'Fouad Msanda'], u'2016-10-19', u'Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess and compare the seed\ngermination response of six Acacia species under different NaCl concentrations\nin order to explore opportunities for selection and breeding salt tolerant\ngenotypes. Methodology: Germination of seeds was evaluated under salt stresses\nusing 5 treatment levels: 0, 100, 200, 300 and 400 mM of NaCl. Corrected\ngermination rate (GC), germination rate index (GRI) and mean germination time\n(MGT) were recorded during 10 days. Results: The results indicated that\ngermination was significantly reduced in all species with the increase in NaCl\nconcentrations. However, significant interspecific variation for salt tolerance\nwas observed. The greatest variability in tolerance was observed at moderate\nsalt stress (200 mM of NaCl) and the decrease in germination appeared to be\nmore accentuated in A. cyanophylla and A. cyclops. Although, A. raddiana,\nremains the most interesting, it preserved the highest percentage (GC = 80%)\nand velocity of germination in all species studied in this study, even in the\nhigh salt levels. This species exhibited a particular adaptability to salt\nenvironment, at least at this stage in the life cycle and could be recommended\nfor plantation establishment in salt affected areas. On the other hand, when\nungerminated seeds were transferred from NaCl treatments to distilled water,\nthey recovered largely their germination without a lag period and with high\nspeed. This indicated that the germination inhibition was related to a\nreversible osmotic stress that induced dormancy rather than specific ion\ntoxicity. Conclusion: This ability to germinate after exposure to higher\nconcentrations of NaCl suggests that studied species, especially the most\ntolerant could be able to germinate under the salt affected soils and could be\nutilized for the rehabilitation of damaged arid zones.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06033v1', ['Other'], []]
[u'Fractal Dimension and Universality in Avascular Tumor Growth', ['Fabiano L. Ribeiro', 'Renato Vieira dos Santos', 'Angelica S. Mata'], u'2016-10-18', u'The comprehension of tumor growth is a intriguing subject for scientists. New\nresearches has been constantly required to better understand the complexity of\nthis phenomenon. In this paper, we pursue a physical description that account\nfor some experimental facts involving avascular tumor growth. We have proposed\nan explanation of some phenomenological (macroscopic) aspects of tumor, as the\nspatial form and the way it growths, from a individual-level (microscopic)\nformulation. The model proposed here is based on a simple principle:\ncompetitive interaction between the cells dependent on their mutual distances.\nAs a result, we reproduce many empirical evidences observed in real tumors, as\nexponential growth in their early stages followed by a power law growth. The\nmodel also reproduces the fractal space distribution of tumor cells and the\nuniversal behavior presented in animals and tumor growth, conform reported by\nWest, Guiot {\\it et. al.}\\cite{West2001,Guiot2003}. The results suggest that\nthe universal similarity between tumor and animal growth comes from the fact\nthat both are described by the same growth equation - the Bertalanffy-Richards\nmodel - even they does not necessarily share the same biophysical properties.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05789v1', ['Tissues and Organs'], []]
