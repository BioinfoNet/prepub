[u'Effect of Nanodiamond surfaces on Drug Delivery Systems', ['Debsindhu Bhowmik', 'Gurpreet K. Dhindsa', 'Utsab R. Shrestha', 'Eugene Mamontov', 'Xiang-qiang Chu'], u'2016-09-09', u'The prospect of RNA nanotechnology is increasing because of its numerous\npotential applications especially in medical science. The spherical\nNanodiamonds (NDs) are becoming popular because of their lesser toxicity,\ndesirable mechanical, optical properties, functionality and available surface\nareas. On other hand RNAs are stable, flexible and easy to bind to the NDs. In\nthis work, we have studied the tRNA dynamics on ND surface by high-resolution\nquasi-elastic neutron scattering spectroscopy and all atom molecular dynamics\nsimulation technique to understand how the tRNA motion is affected by the\npresence of ND. The flexibly of the tRNA is analyzed by the Mean square\ndisplacement analysis that shows tRNA have a sharp increase around 230K in its\nhydrated form. The intermediate scattering function (ISF) representing the tRNA\ndynamics follows the logarithmic decay as proposed by the Mode Coupling theory\n(MCT). But most importantly the tRNA dynamics is found to be faster in presence\nof ND within 220K to 310K compared to the freestanding ones. This is as we have\nshown, is because of the swollen RNA molecule due the introduction of\nhydrophilic ND surface.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02656v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Nonlinear resonances and multi-stability in simple neural circuits', ['Leandro M. Alonso'], u'2016-09-09', u'We present an efficient numerical procedure to generate models of neural\ncircuits which exhibit rich dynamical behavior. This is achieved by imposing\nthat the circuits are close to many nonlinear resonances. The procedure is\napplied to generate circuits consisting of two interacting neural populations.\nWhen driven by external input, the resulting circuits present multiple stable\npatterns of periodic activity organized in complex tuning diagrams and\nsignatures of low dimensional chaos.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02896v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Emergent computation in simple model of neural activity', ['Leandro M. Alonso'], u'2016-09-09', u'We investigate the dynamics of a network consisting of an array of identical\ncortical units with nearest neighbor interactions under periodic arousal. Each\nunit consists of two interconnected populations of neurons tuned to a state in\nwhich many nonlinear resonances are available. The network is critically\nbalanced due to short-ranged antisymmetric connections between units. For wide\nranges of the network parameters, the patterns of activity resemble the\ndynamics of cellular automata. It is argued that these dynamical states may\nprovide a template in which computation can be implemented.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02893v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Master equations and the theory of stochastic path integrals', ['Markus F. Weber', 'Erwin Frey'], u'2016-09-09', u'This review provides a pedagogic and self-contained introduction to master\nequations and to their representation by path integrals. We discuss analytical\nand numerical methods for the solution of master equations, keeping our focus\non methods that are applicable even when stochastic fluctuations are strong.\nThe reviewed methods include the generating function technique and the Poisson\nrepresentation, as well as novel ways of mapping the forward and backward\nmaster equations onto linear partial differential equations (PDEs). Spectral\nmethods, WKB approximations, and a variational approach have been proposed for\nthe analysis of the PDE obeyed by the generating function. After outlining\nthese methods, we solve the derived PDEs in terms of two path integrals. The\npath integrals provide distinct exact representations of the conditional\nprobability distribution solving the master equations. We exemplify both path\nintegrals in analysing elementary chemical reactions. Furthermore, we review a\nmethod for the approximation of rare event probabilities and derive path\nintegral representations of Fokker-Planck equations. To make our review\naccessible to a broad community, we have used the language of probability\ntheory rather than quantum (field) theory. The probabilistic structures\nunderpinning various technical concepts, such as coherent states, the\nDoi-shift, and normal-ordered observables, are thereby made explicit.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02849v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'A phenomenological spatial model for macro-ecological patterns in\n  species-rich ecosystems', ['Fabio Peruzzo', 'Sandro zaele'], u'2016-09-09', u'Over the last few decades, ecologists have come to appreciate that key\necological patterns, which describe ecological communities at relatively large\nspatial scales, are not only scale dependent, but also intimately intertwined.\nThe relative abundance of species, which informs us about the commonness and\nrarity of species, changes its shape from small to large spatial scales. The\naverage number of species as a function of area has a steep initial increase,\nfollowed by decreasing slopes at large scales. Finally, if we find a species in\na given location, it is more likely we find an individual of the same species\nclose-by, rather than farther apart. Such spatial turnover depends on the\ngeographical distribution of species, which often are spatially aggregated.\nThis reverberates on the abundances as well as the richness of species within a\nregion, but so far it has been difficult to quantify such relationships. Within\na neutral framework, which considers all individuals competitively equivalent,\nwe introduce a spatial stochastic model, which phenomenologically accounts for\nbirth, death, immigration and local dispersal of individuals. We calculate the\npair correlation function, which encapsulates spatial turnover, and the\nconditional probability to find a species with a certain population within a\ngiven circular area. Also, we calculate the macro-ecological patterns, which we\nhave referred to above, and compare the analytical formul{\\ae} with the\nnumerical integration of the model. Finally, we contrast the model predictions\nwith the empirical data for two lowland tropical forest inventories, showing\nalways a good agreement.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02721v1', ['Populations and Evolution', 'Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Optimal Disease Outbreak Detection in a Community Using Network\n  Observability', ['Atiye Alaeddini', 'Kristi A. Morgansen'], u'2016-09-09', u'Given a network, we would like to determine which subset of nodes should be\nmeasured by limited sensing facilities to maximize information about the entire\nnetwork. The optimal choice corresponds to the configuration that returns the\nhighest value of a measure of observability of the system. Here, the\ndeterminant of the inverse of the observability Gramian is used to evaluate the\ndegree of observability. Additionally, the effects of changes in the topology\nof the corresponding graph of a network on the observability of the network are\ninvestigated. The theory is illustrated on the problem of detection of an\nepidemic disease in a community. The purpose here is to find the smallest\nnumber of people who must be examined to predict the number of infected people\nin an arbitrary community. Results are demonstrated in simulation.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02654v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Instability of spiral and scroll waves in the presence of a gradient in\n  the fibroblast density: the effects of fibroblast-myocyte coupling', ['Soling Zimik', 'Rahul Pandit'], u'2016-09-09', u'Fibroblast-myocyte coupling can modulate electrical-wave dynamics in cardiac\ntissue. In diseased hearts, the distribution of fibroblasts is heterogeneous,\nso there can be gradients in the fibroblast density (henceforth we call this\nGFD) especially from highly injured regions, like infarcted or ischemic zones,\nto less-wounded regions of the tissue. Fibrotic hearts are known to be prone to\narrhythmias, so it is important to understand the effects of GFD in the\nformation and sustenance of arrhythmic re- entrant waves, like spiral or scroll\nwaves. Therefore, we investigate the effects of GFD on the stability of spiral\nand scroll waves of electrical activation in a state-of-the- art mathematical\nmodel for cardiac tissue in which we also include fibroblasts. By introducing\nGFD in controlled ways, we show that spiral and scroll waves can be unstable in\nthe presence of GFDs because of regions with varying spiral or scroll-wave\nfrequency {\\omega}, induced by the GFD. We examine the effects of the resting\nmembrane potential of the fibroblast and the number of fibroblasts attached to\nthe myocytes on the stability of these waves. Finally, we show that the\npresence of GFDs can lead to the formation of spiral waves at high-frequency\npacing.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02740v1', ['Tissues and Organs'], []]
[u'Robustness of indispensable nodes in controlling protein-protein\n  interaction network', ['Xizhe Zhang', 'Huaizhen Wang', 'Yunyi Yang'], u'2016-09-09', u'Recently, the structural controllability theory has been introduced to\nanalyze the Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network. The indispensable nodes,\nwhich their removal increase the number of driver nodes to control the network,\nare found essential in PPI network. However, the PPI network is far from\ncomplete and there may exist many false-positive or false-negative\ninteractions, which promotes us to question: are these indispensable nodes\nrobust to structural change? Here we systematically investigate the robustness\nof indispensable nodes of PPI network by removing and adding possible\ninteractions. We found that the indispensable nodes are sensitive to the\nstructural change and very few edges can change the type of many indispensable\nnodes. The finding may promote our understanding to the control principle of\nPPI network.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02637v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
[u'Learning Directed-Acyclic-Graphs from Large-Scale Genomics Data', ['Fabio Nikolay', 'Marius Pesavento', 'George Kritikos', 'Nassos Typas'], u'2016-09-09', u'In this paper we consider the problem of learning the\ngenetic-interaction-map, i.e., the topology of a directed acyclic graph (DAG)\nof genetic interactions from noisy double knockout (DK) data. Based on a set of\nwell established biological interaction models we detect and classify the\ninteractions between genes. We propose a novel linear integer optimization\nprogram called the Genetic-Interactions-Detector (GENIE) to identify the\ncomplex biological dependencies among genes and to compute the DAG topology\nthat matches the DK measurements best. Furthermore, we extend the GENIE-program\nby incorporating genetic-interactions-profile (GI-profile) data to further\nenhance the detection performance. In addition, we propose a sequential\nscalability technique for large sets of genes under study, in order to provide\nstatistically stressable results for real measurement data. Finally, we show\nvia numeric simulations that the GENIE-program as well as the GI-profile data\nextended GENIE (GI-GENIE)-program clearly outperform the conventional\ntechniques and present real data results for our proposed sequential\nscalability technique.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02794v1', ['Genomics'], []]
