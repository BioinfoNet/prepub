[u'Word Length Effects in a Contextual Model of Verbal Perception', ['Francesco Fumarola'], u'2016-07-19', u'Retrieved-context models have played a crucial role in the understanding of\nserial-position effects in free recall. In this paper, a simple model in that\nclass is proposed and tested against the case of word-length experiments. In\nrecent years, standard interpretations of the word-length effect have been\nundermined by a series of experimental results, culminating with data that\ndisplay an inversion of the effect for mixed lists. The model discussed in this\npaper predicts the experimental behavior as an effect of the different level of\nlocalization of short and long words in semantic space. Events corresponding to\nthe recognition of a nonlocal word have a clustering property in phase space,\nwhich facilitates associative retrieval. The standard word-length effect arises\ndirectly from this property, and the inverse effect from its breakdown. The\ntheory predicts that the contiguity effect should be stronger for shorter\nwords. Several other predictions are listed, and experiments are proposed to\nfurther test the model. Finally, a possible interpretation of the results is\ndiscussed.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.05530v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Learning to Allocate Limited Time to Decisions with Different Expected\n  Outcomes', ['Arash Khodadadi', 'Pegah Fakhari', 'Jerome R. Busemeyer'], u'2016-07-18', u'The goal of this article is to investigate how human participants allocate\ntheir limited time to decisions with different properties. We report the\nresults of two behavioral experiments. In each trial of the experiments, the\nparticipant must accumulate noisy information to make a decision. The\nparticipants received positive and negative rewards for their correct and\nincorrect decisions, respectively. The stimulus was designed such that\ndecisions based on more accumulated information were more accurate but took\nlonger. Therefore, the total outcome that a participant could achieve during\nthe limited experiments\' time depended on her "decision threshold", the amount\nof information she needed to make a decision. In the first experiment, two\ntypes of trials were intermixed randomly: hard and easy. Crucially, the hard\ntrials were associated with smaller positive and negative rewards than the easy\ntrials. A cue presented at the beginning of each trial would indicate the type\nof the upcoming trial. The optimal strategy was to adopt a small decision\nthreshold for hard trials. The results showed that several of the participants\ndid not learn this simple strategy. We then investigated how the participants\nadjusted their decision threshold based on the feedback they received in each\ntrial. To this end, we developed and compared 10 computational models for\nadjusting the decision threshold. The models differ in their assumptions on the\nshape of the decision thresholds and the way the feedback is used to adjust the\ndecision thresholds. The results of Bayesian model comparison showed that a\nmodel with time-varying thresholds whose parameters are updated by a\nreinforcement learning algorithm is the most likely model.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.05334v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'What causes the increase in aggregation as a parasite moves up a food\n  chain?', ['R. J. G. Lester', 'R. McVinish'], u'2016-07-19', u'General laws in ecological parasitology are scarce. Here we evaluate data\npublished by over 100 authors to determine whether the number of hosts in a\nlife cycle is associated with the degree of aggregation of fish parasites at\ndifferent stages. Parasite species were grouped taxonomically to produce 20 or\nmore data points per group as far as possible. Most parasites that remained at\none trophic level were less aggregated than those that had passed up a food\nchain. We use a stochastic model to show that high parasite overdispersion in\npredators can be solely the result of the accumulation of parasites in their\nprey. The model is further developed to show that a change in the predators\nfeeding behaviour with age may further increase parasite aggregation.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.05398v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Phase modulation of hormonal oscillations', ['Dong-Ho Park', 'Taegeun Song', 'Danh-Tai Hoang', 'Jin Xu', 'Junghyo Jo'], u'2016-07-19', u'Dynamic equilibrium is maintained by counter-regulating elements in living\nsystems. The pancreatic {\\alpha} and {\\beta} cells produce glucagon and insulin\nfor glucose homeostasis. They exist in multiple micro-organs, the islets of\nLangerhans, not in a single gigantic organ, in which the two reciprocal cells\ninteract to each other, and also with an additional cell type, {\\delta} cell.\nWe found that the positive/negative interactions between the islet cells are\ndesigned not only to reduce the wasteful zero-sum action of glucagon and\ninsulin, but also to enhance/suppress synchronization of hormone secretions\nbetween islets under high/normal glucose conditions. Thus we suggest that the\nanti-symmetric interaction between three cell populations can organize an\neffective network motif for controlling network synchronization.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.05386v1', ['Tissues and Organs'], []]
[u'Structured Models of Cell Migration Incorporating Molecular Binding\n  Processes', ['Pia Domschke', 'Dumitru Trucu', 'Alf Gerisch', 'Mark A. J. Chaplain'], u'2016-07-18', u'The dynamic interplay between collective cell movement and the various\nmolecules involved in the accompanying cell signalling mechanisms plays a\ncrucial role in many biological processes including normal tissue development\nand pathological scenarios such as wound healing and cancer. Information about\nthe various structures embedded within these processes allows a detailed\nexploration of the binding of molecular species to cell-surface receptors\nwithin the evolving cell population. In this paper we establish a general\nspatio-temporal-structural framework that enables the description of molecular\nbinding to cell membranes coupled with the cell population dynamics. We first\nprovide a general theoretical description for this approach and then illustrate\nit with two examples arising from cancer invasion.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.05353v1', ['Tissues and Organs', 'Cell Behavior'], []]
[u'A nonequilibrium diffusion and capture mechanism ensures\n  tip-localization of regulating proteins on dynamic filaments', ['Emanuel Reithmann', 'Louis Reese', 'Erwin Frey'], u'2016-07-18', u'Diffusive motion of regulatory enzymes on biopolymers with eventual capture\nat a reaction site is a common feature in cell biology. Using a lattice gas\nmodel we study the impact of diffusion and capture for a microtubule polymerase\nand a depolymerase. Our results show that the capture mechanism localizes the\nproteins and creates large-scale spatial correlations. We develop an analytic\napproximation that globally accounts for relevant correlations and yields\nresults that are in excellent agreement with experimental data. Our results\nshow that diffusion and capture operates most efficiently at cellular enzyme\nconcentrations which points to in vivo relevance.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.05304v1', ['Subcellular Processes'], []]
