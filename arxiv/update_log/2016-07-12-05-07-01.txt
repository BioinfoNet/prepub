[u'Elastic Model for Dinucleosome Structure and Energy', ['Hashem Fatemi', 'Fatemeh Khodabandeh', 'Farshid Mohammad-Rafiee'], u'2016-07-11', u'The equilibrium structure of a Dinucleosome is studied using an elastic model\nthat takes into account the force and torque balance conditions. Using the\nproper boundary conditions, it is found that the conformational energy of the\nproblem does not depend on the length of the linker DNA. In addition it is\nshown that the two histone octamers are almost perpendicular to each other and\nthe linker DNA in short lengths is almost straight. These findings could shed\nsome light on the role of DNA elasticity in the chromatin structure.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02828v1', ['Biomolecules', 'Genomics'], []]
[u'Significance of Natural Scene Statistics in Understanding the\n  Anisotropies of Perceptual Filling-in at the Blind Spot', ['Rajani Raman', 'Sandip Sarkar'], u'2016-07-11', u'Natural scene contains anisotropic distributions of features. For both\nevolutionary and developmental reasons, some of these are expressed as\nover-representation of neurons in V1 in a certain orientation. This\nover-representation is believed to be responsible for the emergence of\nperceptual anisotropies (e.g. oblique and horizontal effect), but its\nfunctional significance in anisotropies of perceptual filling-in of\ndiscontinuity at the blind spot remains unknown. Here, we have examined this\nsignificance in filling-in of bar stimuli (expanding bar, misaligned bar and\nrotating bar in cardinal configuration) in a model network in the framework of\nHierarchical Predictive Coding scheme. The model network was able to encode\nnatural scene statistics via training and demonstrated anisotropic filling-in\nperformance at the blind spot that could be explained in terms of natural scene\nstatistics. In line with the results of psychophysical studies, the model\nnetwork exhibited horizontal superiority in filling-in performance for varying\nlength; on the other hand, it exhibited vertical superiority in the tolerance\nof filling-in for varying misalignment and orientation difference. We suggest\nthat natural scene statistics plays a significant role in determining the\nfilling-in performance at the blind spot and shaping the associated\nanisotropies.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02865v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Visual Motion Onset Brain-computer Interface', ['Jair Pereira Junior', 'Caio Teixeira', 'Tomasz M. Rutkowski'], u'2016-07-10', u'The paper presents a study of two novel visual motion onset stimulus-based\nbrain-computer interfaces (vmoBCI). Two settings are compared with afferent and\nefferent to a computer screen center motion patterns. Online vmoBCI experiments\nare conducted in an oddball paradigm allowing for aha-responses decoding in EEG\nbrainwaves. A subsequent stepwise linear discriminant analysis classification\n(swLDA) classification accuracies comparison is discussed based on two\ninter-stimulus-interval (ISI) settings of 700 and 150 ms in two online vmoBCI\napplications with six and eight command settings. A research hypothesis of\nclassification accuracies nonsignificant differences with various ISIs is\nconfirmed based on the two settings of 700 ms and 150 ms, as well as with\nvarious numbers of ERP response averaging scenarios. The efferent in respect to\ndisplay center visual motion patterns allowed for faster interfacing and thus\nthey are recommended as more suitable for the BCI.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02695v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Possible existence of optical communication channels in the brain', ['Sourabh Kumar', 'Kristine Boone', 'Jack Tuszynski', 'Paul E. Barclay', 'Christoph Simon'], u'2016-07-07', u'Given that many fundamental questions in neuroscience are still open, it\nseems pertinent to explore whether the brain might use other physical\nmodalities than the ones that have been discovered so far. In particular it is\nwell established that neurons can emit photons, which prompts the question\nwhether these biophotons could serve as signals between neurons, in addition to\nthe well-known electro-chemical signals. For such communication to be targeted,\nthe photons would need to travel in waveguides. Here we show, based on detailed\ntheoretical modeling, that myelinated axons could serve as photonic waveguides,\ntaking into account realistic optical imperfections. We propose experiments,\nboth \\textit{in vivo} and \\textit{in vitro}, to test our hypothesis. We discuss\nthe implications of our results, including the question whether photons could\nmediate long-range quantum entanglement in the brain.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02969v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

[u'Reductions in Depth-integrated Picophytoplanktonic Photosynthesis Due to\n  Inhibition by Ultraviolet and Photosynthetically Available Radiation: Global\n  Predictions for $\\textit{Prochlorococcus}$ and $\\textit{Synechococcus}$', ['Patrick J. Neale', 'Brian C. Thomas'], u'2016-06-28', u'Phytoplankton photosynthesis in most natural waters is often inhibited by\nultraviolet (UV) and intense photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) but\nthe effects on ocean productivity have received little consideration aside from\npolar areas subject to periodic enhanced UV-B due to depletion of stratospheric\nozone. Here we consider responses in the temperate and tropical mid-ocean\nregions typically dominated by picophytoplankton including the prokaryotic\nlineages, $\\textit{Prochlorococcus}$ and $\\textit{Synechococcus}$. Spectral\nmodels of photosynthetic response for each lineage were constructed using model\nstrains cultured at different growth irradiances and temperatures. In the\nmodel, inhibition becomes more severe once exposure exceeds a threshold (Emax)\nrelated to repair capacity. Model parameters are presented for\n$\\textit{Prochlorococcus}$ adding to those previously presented for\n$\\textit{Synechococcus}$. The models were applied to the estimation of mid-day,\nwater-column photosynthesis based on an atmospheric model of spectral incident\nradiation, satellite-derived spectral water transparency and sea surface\ntemperature. Comparing predictions integrated over the water column including\nversus excluding inhibition, production was 7-28% lower due to inhibition\ndepending on strain and site conditions. Inhibition was consistently greater\nfor $\\textit{Prochlorococcus}$ compared to two strains of\n$\\textit{Synechococcus}$. Considering only the surface mixed layer, production\nwas inhibited 7-73%. Weighted by lineage abundance and daily PAR exposure,\ninhibition of full water column production averages around 20% for the modeled\nregion of the Pacific with two-thirds of the inhibition due to UV. The results\nsuggest more consideration is needed on inhibition effects, especially due to\nUV, which are largely excluded from present models of global phytoplankton\nproduction.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02980v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], [u'SERC', u'Washburn Univ.']]
[u'Developing and Testing a Bayesian Analysis of Fluorescence Lifetime\n  Measurements', ['Bryan Kaye', 'Peter J. Foster', 'Tae Yeon Yoo', 'Daniel J. Needleman'], u'2016-07-11', u'FRET measurements can provide dynamic spatial information on length scales\nsmaller than the diffraction limit of light. Several methods exist to measure\nFRET between fluorophores, including Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy\n(FLIM), which relies on the reduction of fluorescence lifetime when a\nfluorophore is undergoing FRET. FLIM measurements take the form of histograms\nof photon arrival times, containing contributions from a mixed population of\nfluorophores both undergoing and not undergoing FRET, with the measured\ndistribution being a mixture of exponentials of different lifetimes. Here, we\npresent an analysis method based on Bayesian inference that rigorously takes\ninto account several experimental complications. We test the precision and\naccuracy of our analysis on controlled experimental data and verify that we can\nfaithfully extract model parameters, both in the low-photon and low-fraction\nregimes.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03063v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'SANA: Simulated Annealing Network Alignment Applied to Biological\n  Networks', ['Nil Mamano', 'Wayne Hayes'], u'2016-07-09', u'The alignment of biological networks has the potential to teach us as much\nabout biology and disease as has sequence alignment. Sequence alignment can be\noptimally solved in polynomial time. In contrast, network alignment is\n$NP$-hard, meaning optimal solutions are impossible to find, and the quality of\nfound alignments depend strongly upon the algorithm used to create them. Every\nnetwork alignment algorithm consists of two orthogonal components: first, an\nobjective function or measure $M$ that is used to evaluate the quality of any\nproposed alignment, and second, a search algorithm used to explore the\nexponentially large set of possible alignments in an effort to find "good" ones\naccording to $M$. Objective functions fall into many categories, including\nbiological measures such as sequence similarity, as well as topological\nmeasures like graphlet similarity and edge coverage (possibly weighted).\nAlgorithms to search the space of all possible alignments can be deterministic\nor stochastic, and many possibilities have been offered over the past decade.\nIn this paper we introduce a new stochastic search algorithm called SANA:\nSimulated Annealing Network Aligner. We test it on several popular objective\nfunctions and demonstrate that it almost universally optimizes each one\nsignificantly better than existing search algorithms. Finally, we compare\nseveral topological objective functions using SANA. Software available at\nhttp://sana.ics.uci.edu.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02642v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
[u'Filter-feeding, near-field flows, and the morphologies of colonial\n  choanoflagellates', ['Julius B. Kirkegaard', 'Raymond E. Goldstein'], u'2016-07-11', u'Efficient uptake of nutrients from the environment is an important component\nin the fitness of all microorganisms, and its dependence on size may reveal\nclues to the origins of evolutionary transitions to multicellularity. Because\npotential benefits in uptake rates must be viewed in the context of other costs\nand benefits of size, such as varying predation rates and the increased\nmetabolic costs associated with larger and more complex body plans, the uptake\nrate itself is not necessarily that which is optimized by evolution. Uptake\nrates can be strongly dependent on local organism geometry and its swimming\nspeed, providing selective pressure for particular arrangements. Here we\nexamine these issues for choanoflagellates, filter-feeding microorganisms that\nare the closest relatives of the animals. We explore the different\nmorphological variations of the choanoflagellete $Salpingoeca~rosetta$, which\ncan exist as a swimming cell, a sessile thecate cell, and as colonies of cells\nin various shapes. In the absence of other requirements and in a homogeneously\nnutritious environment, we find that the optimal strategy to maximize filter\nfeeding by the collar of microvilli is to swim fast, which favours swimming\nunicells. In large external flows, the sessile thecate cell becomes\nadvantageous. Effects of prey diffusion are discussed and also found to be to\nthe advantage of the swimming unicell.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02892v1', ['Cell Behavior'], []]
