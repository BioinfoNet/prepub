[u'Human brain parcellation using time courses of instantaneous\n  correlations', ['Erik S. B. van Oort', 'Maarten Mennes', 'Vinod J. Kumar', 'Wolfgang Grodd', 'Christian F. Beckmann'], u'2016-09-15', u'Recent functional neuroimaging studies have shown that the brain can be\ndivided into several spatially separate, functionally distinct networks. The\ninvestigation of these networks has become an active field of research to\nunderstand the brain as a set of interacting subunits. Key to this\nunderstanding is the manner in which these network break down into smaller\nfundamental sub-regions, and how these sub-regions reflect brain function\nand/or structural markers such as cytoarchitectonic features. In this work we\npropose a novel top-down functional parcellation strategy, using time courses\nof instantaneous correlations to subdivide an initial region of interest (ROI)\ninto subregions. We demonstrate that large-scale functional networks can be\nbroken down into biologically meaningful subdivisions that largely follow\ncytoarchitectonically defined areas. We apply our Instantaneous Correlation\nParcellation (ICP) strategy on high-quality resting-state FMRI data, and\nevaluate against an example system in the form of the thalamus. The thalamic\nparcellation was compared in detail to the Morel histological atlas. All\nparcellations were found to show a close correspondence with underlying\nhistology, with Dice overlaps of up to 0.96.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04636v1', ['Neurons and Cognition', 'Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Inhibitory loop robustly induces anticipated synchronization in neuronal\n  microcircuits', ['Fernanda S. Matias', 'Leonardo L. Gollo', 'Pedro V. Carelli', 'Claudio R. Mirasso', 'Mauro Copelli'], u'2016-09-14', u'We investigate the synchronization properties between two excitatory coupled\nneurons in the presence of an inhibitory loop mediated by an interneuron.\nDynamical inhibition together with noise independently applied to each neuron\nprovide phase diversity in the dynamics of the neuronal motif. We show that the\ninterplay between the coupling strengths and external noise controls the phase\nrelations between the neurons in a counter-intuitive way. For a master-slave\nconfiguration (unidirectional coupling) we find that the slave can anticipate\nthe master, on average, if the slave is subject to the inhibitory feedback. In\nthis non-usual regime, called anticipated synchronization (AS), the phase of\nthe post-synaptic neuron is advanced with respect to that of the pre-synaptic\nneuron. We also show that the AS regime survives even in the presence of\nunbalanced bidirectional excitatory coupling. Moreover, for the symmetric\nmutually coupled situation, the neuron that is subject to the inhibitory loop\nleads in phase.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04419v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Stochastic evolution in populations of ideas', ['Robin Nicole', 'Peter Sollich', 'Tobias Galla'], u'2016-09-14', u'It is known that learning of players who interact in a repeated game can be\ninterpreted as an evolutionary process in a population of ideas. These\nanalogies have so far mostly been established in deterministic models, and\nmemory loss in learning has been seen to act similarly to mutation in\nevolution. We here propose a representation of reinforcement learning as a\nstochastic process in finite "populations of ideas". The resulting birth-death\ndynamics has absorbing states and allows for the extinction or fixation of\nideas, marking a key difference to mutation-selection processes in finite\npopulations. We characterize the outcome of evolution in populations of ideas\nfor several classes of symmetric and asymmetric games.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04443v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Light Will be Thrown: The Emerging Science of Cultural Evolution', ['Chris Buskes'], u'2016-09-08', u'Culture evolves, not just in the trivial sense that cultures change over\ntime, but also in the strong sense that such change is governed by Darwinian\nprinciples. Both biological and cultural evolution are essentially cumulative\nselection processes in which information (whether genetic or cultural) is\nsieved, retained and then transmitted to the next generation. In both domains\nsuch a process will result in recognizable lineages and tree-like phylogenies\nso characteristic of Darwinian evolution. Because a principle of inheritance\n(i.e., faithful replication of information) holds in both domains, we may trace\nback particular transmission histories and identify the forces that influenced\nthem. The idea that culture evolves is quite old, but only in recent years\nthere has been a serious effort to turn this idea into science. This article\noffers a concise analysis of how a rudimentary idea gradually evolved into a\nthriving research program.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04638v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

[u'Learning Schizophrenia Imaging Genetics Data Via Multiple Kernel\n  Canonical Correlation Analysis', ['Owen Richfield', 'Md. Ashad Alam', 'Vince Calhoun', 'Yu-Ping Wang'], u'2016-09-15', u'Kernel and Multiple Kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) are employed\nto classify schizophrenic and healthy patients based on their SNPs, DNA\nMethylation and fMRI data. Kernel and Multiple Kernel CCA are popular methods\nfor finding nonlinear correlations between high-dimensional datasets. Data was\ngathered from 183 patients, 79 with schizophrenia and 104 healthy controls.\nKernel and Multiple Kernel CCA represent new avenues for studying\nschizophrenia, because, to our knowledge, these methods have not been used on\nthese data before. Classification is performed via k-means clustering on the\nkernel matrix outputs of the Kernel and Multiple Kernel CCA algorithm.\nAccuracies of the Kernel and Multiple Kernel CCA classification are compared to\nthat of the regularized linear CCA algorithm classification, and are found to\nbe significantly more accurate. Both algorithms demonstrate maximal accuracies\nwhen the combination of DNA methylation and fMRI data are used, and experience\nlower accuracies when the SNP data are incorporated.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04699v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Mathematical Imaging Methods for Mitosis Analysis in Live-Cell Phase\n  Contrast Microscopy', ['Joana Sarah Grah', 'Jennifer Harrington', 'Siang Boon Koh', 'Jeremy Pike', 'Alexander Schreiner', 'Martin Burger', 'Carola-Bibiane Schonlieb', 'Stefanie Reichelt'], u'2016-09-14', u'In this paper we propose a workflow to detect and track mitotic cells in\ntime-lapse microscopy image sequences. In order to avoid the requirement for\ncell lines expressing fluorescent markers and the associated phototoxicity,\nphase contrast microscopy is often preferred over fluorescence microscopy in\nlive-cell imaging. However, common specific image characteristics complicate\nimage processing and impede use of standard methods. Nevertheless, automated\nanalysis is desirable due to manual analysis being subjective, biased and\nextremely time-consuming for large data sets. Here, we present the following\nworkflow based on mathematical imaging methods. In the first step, mitosis\ndetection is performed by means of the circular Hough transform. The obtained\ncircular contour subsequently serves as an initialisation for the tracking\nalgorithm based on variational methods. It is sub-divided into two parts: in\norder to determine the beginning of the whole mitosis cycle, a backwards\ntracking procedure is performed. After that, the cell is tracked forwards in\ntime until the end of mitosis. As a result, the average of mitosis duration and\nratios of different cell fates (cell death, no division, division into two or\nmore daughter cells) can be measured and statistics on cell morphologies can be\nobtained. All of the tools are featured in the user-friendly\nMATLAB$^{\\circledR}$ Graphical User Interface MitosisAnalyser.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04649v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]

We compare three different mechanisms of RPE repair\nevolution, cell apoptosis, cell fusion, and expansion, and Simulations of our\nRPE morphogenesis model quantitatively reproduce deformations of human RPE\nmorphology due to drusen, suggesting that a purse-string mechanism is\nsufficient to explain how RPE heals cell loss caused by drusen-damage. We found\nthat drusen beneath tissue promote cell death in a number that far exceeds the\ncell numbers covering the drusen.

[u'Membrane tubulation by elongated and patchy nanoparticles', ['Michael Raatz', 'Thomas R. Weikl'], u'2016-09-15', u'Advances in nanotechnology lead to an increasing interest in how\nnanoparticles interact with biomembranes. Nanoparticles are wrapped\nspontaneously by biomembranes if the adhesive interactions between the\nparticles and membranes compensate for the cost of membrane bending. In the\nlast years, the cooperative wrapping of spherical nanoparticles in membrane\ntubules has been observed in experiments and simulations. For spherical\nnanoparticles, the stability of the particle-filled membrane tubules strongly\ndepends on the range of the adhesive particle-membrane interactions. In this\narticle, we show via modeling and energy minimization that elongated and patchy\nparticles are wrapped cooperatively in membrane tubules that are highly stable\nfor all ranges of the particle-membrane interactions, compared to individual\nwrapping of the particles. The cooperative wrapping of linear chains of\nelongated or patchy particles in membrane tubules may thus provide an efficient\nroute to induce membrane tubulation, or to store such particles in membranes.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04515v1', ['Subcellular Processes'], []]
