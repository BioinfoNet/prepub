[u'Benchmarking inverse statistical approaches for protein structure and\n  design with exactly solvable models', ['Hugo Jacquin', 'Amy Gilson', 'Eugene Shakhnovich', 'Simona Cocco', 'Remi Monasson'], u'2016-11-15', u"Inverse statistical approaches to determine protein structure and function\nfrom Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSA) are emerging as powerful tools in\ncomputational biology. However the underlying assumptions of the relationship\nbetween the inferred effective Potts Hamiltonian and real protein structure and\nenergetics remain untested so far. Here we use lattice protein model (LP) to\nbenchmark those inverse statistical approaches. We build MSA of highly stable\nsequences in target LP structures, and infer the effective pairwise Potts\nHamiltonians from those MSA. We find that inferred Potts Hamiltonians reproduce\nmany important aspects of 'true' LP structures and energetics. Careful analysis\nreveals that effective pairwise couplings in inferred Potts Hamiltonians depend\nnot only on the energetics of the native structure but also on competing folds;\nin particular, the coupling values reflect both positive design (stabilization\nof native conformation) and negative design (destabilization of competing\nfolds). In addition to providing detailed structural information, the inferred\nPotts models used as protein Hamiltonian for design of new sequences are able\nto generate with high probability completely new sequences with the desired\nfolds, which is not possible using independent-site models. Those are\nremarkable results as the effective LP Hamiltonians used to generate MSA are\nnot simple pairwise models due to the competition between the folds. Our\nfindings elucidate the reasons for the success of inverse approaches to the\nmodelling of proteins from sequence data, and their limitations.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05082v1', ['Biomolecules', 'Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Positive Feedback and Synchronized Bursts in Neuronal Cultures', ['Yu-Ting Huang', 'Yu-Lin Chang', 'Chun-Chung Chen', 'Pik-Yin Lai', 'C. K. Chan'], u'2016-11-16', u'Synchronized bursts (SBs) with complex structures are common in neuronal\ncultures. Although the origin of SBs is still unclear, they have been studied\nfor their information processing capabilities. Here, we investigate the\nproperties of these SBs in a culture on multi-electrode array system. We find\nthat structures of these SBs are related to the different developmental stages\nof the cultures. A model based on short term synaptic plasticity, recurrent\nconnections and astrocytic recycling of neurotransmitters has been developed\nsuccessfully to understand these structures. A phase diagram obtained from this\nmodel shows that networks exhibiting SBs are in an oscillatory state due to\nlarge enough positive feedback provided by synaptic facilitation and recurrent\nconnections. In this model, the structures of the SBs are the results of\nintrinsic synaptic interactions; not information stored in the network.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05150v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

They\nshowed that if all the hosts experienced infection return directly to the\nsusceptible compartment upon recovery, such oscillations are ruled out in\nSusceptible-Aware-Infectious Susceptible models with a single compartment of\naware hosts, but can occur if two distinct compartments of aware hosts who\ndiffer in their willingness to alert other susceptible hosts are considered.\nQualitatively, the models studied here produce the same results when we assume\nthat recovery from the disease may or even will convey awareness from direct\nexperience.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05100v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

Dinner'], u'2016-11-16', u'It is well known that population sizes increase exponentially during balanced\ngrowth. Concomitantly, at the single-cell level, the sizes of individual cells\nthemselves increase exponentially; the single-cell exponential growth-rate also\ndetermines the statistics of cell size and cell division time distributions.\nSeeking an integrated perspective of microbial growth dynamics under balanced\nconditions, we formulate a theoretical framework that takes into account\nobservables at both single-cell and population scales. Our exact analytical\nsolutions for both symmetric and asymmetric cell division reveal surprising\neffects of the stochastic single-cell dynamics on features of population\ngrowth. In particular, we find how the population growth rate is sensitive to\nthe shape of the distribution of cell division times. We validate the model by\nquantitatively predicting the observed cell-age distributions without fitting\nparameters. Our model also provides a prescription for deducing the time for\ntransitioning from the swarmer (reproductively quiescent) to stalked\n(reproduction able) stage of the {\\em C. crescentus} lifecycle; our predictions\nmatch with previous indirect estimates. We discuss the scalings of all\ntimescales with external parameters that control the balanced growth state. For\n{\\em C. crescentus} cells, we show that the rate of exponential growth of\nsingle (stalked) cells governs the dynamics of the entire lifecycle, including\nthe swarmer-to-stalked cell transition.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05149v1', ['Quantitative Methods', 'Cell Behavior'], []]

The model\ninvestigates the interplay between bulk elasticity of the microtubule assembly,\ndescribed as a nematic liquid crystal, and surface elasticity of the cell\ncortex, modelled as a bounding flexible membrane, in controlling cell shape and\ndivision. The centrosomes at the spindle poles correspond to the cores of the\ntopological defects required to accommodate nematic order in a closed geometry.\nWe map out the progression of both healthy bipolar and faulty multi-polar\ndivision as a function of an effective parameter that incorporates active\nprocesses and controls centrosome separation. A robust prediction, independent\nof energetic considerations, is that the transition from a single cell to\ndaughters cells occurs at critical value of this parameter. Our model\nadditionally suggests that microtubule anchoring at the cell cortex may play an\nimportant role for successful bipolar division. This can be tested\nexperimentally by regulating microtubule anchoring.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04958v1', ['Cell Behavior'], []]
