[u'Dramatic changes in DNA Conductance with stretching: Structural\n  Polymorphism at a critical extension', ['Saientan Bag', 'Santosh Mogurampelly', 'William A Goddard III', 'Prabal K Maiti'], u'2016-08-25', u"In order to interpret recent experimental studies of the dependence of\nconductance of ds-DNA as the DNA is pulled from the 3'end1-3'end2 ends, which\nfind a sharp conductance jump for a very short (4.5 %) stretching length, we\ncarried out multiscale modeling, to predict the conductance of dsDNA as it is\nmechanically stretched to promote various structural polymorphisms. We\ncalculate the current along the stretched DNA using a combination of molecular\ndynamics simulations, non-equilibrium pulling simulations, quantum mechanics\ncalculations, and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. For 5'end1-5'end2\nattachments we find an abrupt jump in the current within a very short\nstretching length (6 $ \\AA $ or 17 %) leading to a melted DNA state. In\ncontrast, for 3'end1-3'end2 pulling it takes almost 32$ \\AA $ (84 %) of\nstretching to cause a similar jump in the current. Thus, we demonstrate that\ncharge transport in DNA can occur over stretching lengths of several\nnanometers. We find that this unexpected behaviour in the B to S conformational\nDNA transition arises from highly inclined base pair geometries that result\nfrom this pulling protocol. We find that the dramatically different conductance\nbehaviors for two different pulling protocols arise from the nature of how\nhydrogen bonds of DNA base pairs break.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07092v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Protein Collapse is Encoded in the Folded State Architecture', ['Himadri S. Samanta', 'Pavel I. Zhuravlev', 'Michael Hinczewski', 'Naoto Hori', 'Shaon Chakrabarti', 'D. Thirumalai'], u'2016-08-24', u'Natural protein sequences that self-assemble to form globular structures are\ncompact with high packing densities in the folded states. It is known that\nproteins unfold upon addition of denaturants, adopting random coil structures.\nThe dependence of the radii of gyration on protein size in the folded and\nunfolded states obeys the same scaling laws as synthetic polymers. Thus, one\nmight surmise that the mechanism of collapse in proteins and polymers ought to\nbe similar. However, because the number of amino acids in single domain\nproteins is not significantly greater than about two hundred, it has not been\nresolved if the unfolded states of proteins are compact under conditions that\nfavor the folded states - a problem at the heart of how proteins fold. By\nadopting a theory used to derive polymer-scaling laws, we find that the\npropensity for the unfolded state of a protein to be compact is universal and\nis encoded in the contact map of the folded state. Remarkably, analysis of over\n2000 proteins shows that proteins rich in $\\beta$-sheets have greater tendency\nto be compact than $\\alpha$-helical proteins. The theory provides insights into\nthe reasons for the small size of single domain proteins and the physical basis\nfor the origin of multi-domain proteins. Application to non-coding RNA\nmolecules show that they have evolved to collapse sharing similarities to\n$\\beta$-sheet proteins. An implication of our theory is that the evolution of\nnatural foldable sequences is guided by the requirement that for efficient\nfolding they should populate minimum energy compact states under folding\nconditions. This concept also supports the compaction selection hypothesis used\nto rationalize the unusually condensed states of viral RNA molecules.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06971v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'A Neuro-Fuzzy Model of Time-Varying Decision Boundaries', ['Arash Khodadadi', 'Pegah Fakhari', 'Jerome R Busemeyer'], u'2016-08-25', u'In a recent study, we reported the results of a new decision making paradigm\nin which the participants were asked to balance between their speed and\naccuracy to maximize the total reward they achieve during the experiment. The\nresults of computational modeling provided strong evidence suggesting that the\nparticipants used time-varying decision boundaries. Previous theoretical\nstudies of the optimal speed-accuracy trade-off suggested that the participants\nmay learn to use these time-varying boundaries to maximize their average reward\nrate. The results in our experiment, however, showed that the participants used\nsuch boundaries even at the beginning of the experiment and without any prior\nexperience in the task. In this paper, we hypothesize that these boundaries are\nthe results of using some heuristic rules to make decisions in the task. To\nformulate decision making by these heuristic rules as a computational\nframework, we use the fuzzy logic theory. Based on this theory, we propose a\nnew computational framework for decision making in evidence accumulation tasks.\nIn this framework, there is no explicit decision boundary. Instead, the\nsubject\'s desire to stop accumulating evidence and responding at each moment\nwithin a trial and for a given value of the accumulated evidence, is determined\nby a set of fuzzy "IF-TEHN rules". We then use the back-propagation method to\nderive an algorithm for fitting the fuzzy model to each participant\'s data. We\nthen investigate how the difference in the participants\' performance in the\nexperiment is reflected in the difference in the parameters of the fitted model', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07244v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Branching into the Unknown: Inferring collective dynamical states from\n  subsampled systems', ['Jens Wilting', 'Viola Priesemann'], u'2016-08-25', u'When studying the dynamics of complex systems, one can rarely sample the\nstate of all components. We show that this spatial subsampling typically leads\nto severe underestimation of the risk of instability in systems with\npropagation of events. We analytically derived a subsampling-invariant\nestimator and applied it to non-linear network simulations and case reports of\nvarious diseases, recovering a close relation between vaccination rate and\nspreading behavior. The estimator can be particularly useful in countries with\nunreliable case reports, and promises early warning if e.g. antibiotic\nresistant bacteria increase their infectiousness. In neuroscience, subsampling\nhas led to contradictory hypotheses about the collective spiking dynamics:\nasynchronous-irregular or critical. With the novel estimator, we demonstrated\nfor rat, cat and monkey that collective dynamics lives in a narrow subspace\nbetween the two. Functionally, this subspace can combine the different\ncomputational properties associated with the two states.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07035v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'matLeap: A fast adaptive Matlab-ready tau-leaping implementation\n  suitable for Bayesian inference', ['Justin Feigelman', 'Stefan Ganscha', 'Manfred Claassen'], u'2016-08-25', u'Background: Species abundance distributions in chemical reaction network\nmodels cannot usually be computed analytically. Instead, stochas- tic\nsimulation algorithms allow sample from the the system configuration. Although\nmany algorithms have been described, no fast implementation has been provided\nfor {\\tau}-leaping which i) is Matlab-compatible, ii) adap- tively alternates\nbetween SSA, implicit and explicit {\\tau}-leaping, and iii) provides summary\nstatistics necessary for Bayesian inference. Results: We provide a\nMatlab-compatible implementation of the adap- tive explicit-implicit\n{\\tau}-leaping algorithm to address the above-mentioned deficits. matLeap\nprovides equal or substantially faster results compared to two widely used\nsimulation packages while maintaining accuracy. Lastly, matLeap yields summary\nstatistics of the stochastic process unavailable with other methods, which are\nindispensable for Bayesian inference. Conclusions: matLeap addresses\nshortcomings in existing Matlab-compatible stochastic simulation software,\nproviding significant speedups and sum- mary statistics that are especially\nuseful for researchers utilizing particle- filter based methods for Bayesian\ninference.

[u'Modelling the effect of curvature on the collective behaviour of cells\n  growing new tissue', ['Almie Alias', 'Pascal R Buenzli'], u'2016-08-25', u"The growth of several biological tissues is known to be controlled in part by\nlocal geometrical features, such as the curvature of the tissue interface. This\ncontrol leads to changes in tissue shape that in turn can affect the tissue's\nevolution. Understanding the cellular basis of this control is highly\nsignificant for bioscaffold tissue engineering, the evolution of bone\nmicroarchitecture, wound healing, and tumour growth. While previous models have\nproposed geometrical relationships between tissue growth and curvature, the\nrole of cell density and cell vigor remains poorly understood. We propose a\ncell-based mathematical model of tissue growth to investigate the systematic\ninfluence of curvature on the collective crowding or spreading of\ntissue-synthesising cells induced by changes in local tissue surface area\nduring the motion of the interface. Depending on the strength of diffusive\ndamping, the model exhibits complex growth patterns such as undulating motion,\nefficient smoothing of irregularities, and the generation of cusps. We compare\nthis model with in-vitro experiments of tissue deposition in bioscaffolds of\ndifferent geometries. By accounting for the depletion of active cells, the\nmodel is able to capture both smoothing of initial substrate geometry and\ntissue deposition slowdown as observed experimentally.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07108v1', ['Tissues and Organs', 'Cell Behavior'], []]
[u'Toward a closed-loop subcutaneous delivery of L-DOPA', ['Marouen Ben Guebila', 'Johan Thunberg'], u'2016-08-24', u"L-DOPA has been the gold standard treatment for Parkinson's disease since 50\nyears. Being the direct biochemical precursor of dopamine, L-DOPA is\neffectively converted in the brain, but two major phenomena reduce its\ntherapeutic action: i) competition with amino acids in the gut wall and in the\nblood brain barrier and ii) its fast kinetics (absorption, distribution,\nmetabolism, and elimination). Continuous administration of L-DOPA, such as\njejunal pumps, have addressed the issue of fast absorption. Considering a\nsubcutaneous delivery of L-DOPA allows to bypass the gastrointestinal tract and\navoid competition with dietary amino acids. Remains the competition at the\nblood barrier between amino acids and L-DOPA, which we address by proposing a\nclosed-loop controlled, continuous subcutaneous delivery pump. In the\nproof-of-concept format, the delivery strategy evaluated on comprehensive model\nof L-DOPA kinetics, holds the promise of improving the treatment of late-stage\nParkinson's disease patients.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07232v1', ['Tissues and Organs'], []]
[u'An All-Encompassing Global Convergence Result for Processive Multisite\n  Phosphorylation Systems', ['Mitchell Eithun', 'Anne Shiu'], u'2016-08-25', u'Phosphorylation, the enzyme-mediated addition of a phosphate group to a\nmolecule, is a ubiquitous chemical mechanism in biology. Multisite\nphosphorylation, the addition of phosphate groups to multiple sites of a single\nmolecule, may be distributive or processive. Distributive systems can be\nbistable, while processive systems were recently shown to be globally stable.\nHowever, this global convergence result was proven only for a specific\nmechanism of processive phosphorylation/dephosphorylation (namely, all\ncatalytic reactions are reversible). Accordingly, we generalize this result to\nallow for processive phosphorylation networks in which each reaction may be\nirreversible, and also to account for possible product inhibition. We\naccomplish this by defining an all-encompassing processive network that\nencapsulates all of these schemes, and then appealing to recent results of\nMarcondes de Freitas, Wiuf, and Feliu that assert global convergence by way of\nmonontone systems theory and network/graph reductions (which correspond to\nremoval of intermediate complexes). Our results form a case study into the\nquestion of when global convergence is preserved when reactions and/or\nintermediate complexes are added to or removed from a network.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07259v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
[u'Modelling Chemical Reasoning to Predict Reactions', ['Marwin H. S. Segler', 'Mark P. Waller'], u'2016-08-25', u'The ability to reason beyond established knowledge allows Organic Chemists to\nsolve synthetic problems and to invent novel transformations. Here, we propose\na model which mimics chemical reasoning and formalises reaction prediction as\nfinding missing links in a knowledge graph. We have constructed a knowledge\ngraph containing 14.4 million molecules and 8.2 million binary reactions, which\nrepresents the bulk of all chemical reactions ever published in the scientific\nliterature. Our model outperforms a rule-based expert system in the reaction\nprediction task for 180,000 randomly selected binary reactions. We show that\nour data-driven model generalises even beyond known reaction types, and is thus\ncapable of effectively (re-) discovering novel transformations (even including\ntransition-metal catalysed reactions). Our model enables computers to infer\nhypotheses about reactivity and reactions by only considering the intrinsic\nlocal structure of the graph, and because each single reaction prediction is\ntypically achieved in a sub-second time frame, our model can be used as a\nhigh-throughput generator of reaction hypotheses for reaction discovery.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07117v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
[u'Pattern formation in polymerising actin flocks: spirals, spots and waves\n  without nonlinear chemistry', ['Thomas Le Goff', 'Benno Liebchen', 'Davide Marenduzzo'], u'2016-08-25', u'We propose a model solely based on actin treadmilling and polymerisation\nwhich describes many characteristic states of actin wave formation: spots,\nspirals and travelling waves. In our model, as in experiments on cell\nrecovering motility following actin depolymerisation, we choose an isotropic\nlow density initial condition; polymerisation of actin filaments then raises\nthe density towards the Onsager threshold where they align. We show that this\nalignment, in turn, destabilizes the isotropic phase and generically induces\ntransient actin spots or spirals as part of the dynamical pathway towards a\npolarized phase which can either be uniform or consist of a series of\nactin-wave trains (flocks). Our results uncover a universal route to actin wave\nformation in the absence of any system specific nonlinear biochemistry, and it\nmay help understand the mechanism underlying the observation of actin spots and\nwaves in vivo. They also suggest a minimal setup to design similar patterns in\nvitro.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07218v1', ['Subcellular Processes'], []]
[u'Time-dependent solutions for a stochastic model of gene expression with\n  molecule production in the form of a compound Poisson process', ['Jakub Jedrak', 'Anna Ochab-Marcinek'], u'2016-08-25', u'We study a stochastic model of gene expression, in which protein production\nhas a form of random bursts whose size distribution is arbitrary, whereas\nprotein decay is a first-order reaction. We find exact analytical expressions\nfor the time evolution of the cumulant-generating function for the most general\ncase when both the burst size probability distribution and the model parameters\ndepend on time in an arbitrary (e.g. oscillatory) manner, and for arbitrary\ninitial conditions. We show that in the case of periodic external activation\nand constant protein degradation rate, the response of the gene is analogous to\nthe RC low-pass filter, where slow oscillations of the external driving have a\ngreater effect on gene expression than the fast ones. We also demonstrate that\nthe $n$-th cumulant of the protein number distribution depends on the $n$-th\nmoment of the burst size distribution. We use these results to show that\ndifferent measures of noise (coefficient of variation, Fano factor, fractional\nchange of variance) may vary in time in a different manner. Therefore, any\nbiological hypothesis of evolutionary optimization based on the nonmonotonicity\nof a chosen measure of noise must justify why it assumes that biological\nevolution quantifies noise in that particular way. Finally, we show that not\nonly for exponentially distributed burst sizes but also for a wider class of\nburst size distributions (e.g. Dirac delta and gamma) the control of gene\nexpression level by burst frequency modulation gives rise to proportional\nscaling of variance of the protein number distribution to its mean, whereas the\ncontrol by amplitude modulation implies proportionality of protein number\nvariance to the mean squared.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07139v1', ['Subcellular Processes'], []]
