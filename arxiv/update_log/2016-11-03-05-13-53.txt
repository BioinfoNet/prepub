We\nfind that distinct oligomeric states of MscL lead to distinct gateway states\nfor the clustering of MscL, and predict signatures of MscL structure and\nspatial organization in the cooperative gating of MscL.

[u'A multi-resolution model to capture both global fluctuations of an\n  enzyme and molecular recognition in the ligand-binding site', ['Aoife C. Fogarty', 'Raffaello Potestio', 'Kurt Kremer'], u'2016-11-02', u'In multi-resolution simulations, different system components are\nsimultaneously modelled at different levels of resolution, these being smoothly\ncoupled together. In the case of enzyme systems, computationally expensive\natomistic detail is needed in the active site to capture the chemistry of\nsubstrate binding. Global properties of the rest of the protein also play an\nessential role, determining the structure and fluctuations of the binding site;\nhowever, these can be modelled on a coarser level. Similarly, in the most\ncomputationally efficient scheme only the solvent hydrating the active site\nrequires atomistic detail. We present a methodology to couple atomistic and\ncoarse-grained protein models, while solvating the atomistic part of the\nprotein in atomistic water. This allows a free choice of which protein and\nsolvent degrees of freedom to include atomistically, without loss of accuracy\nin the atomistic description. This multi-resolution methodology can\nsuccessfully model stable ligand binding, and we further confirm its validity\nvia an exploration of system properties relevant to enzymatic function. In\naddition to a computational speedup, such an approach can allow the\nidentification of the essential degrees of freedom playing a role in a given\nprocess, potentially yielding new insights into biomolecular function.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00545v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Variational Methods for Biomolecular Modeling', ['Guo-Wei Wei', 'Y. C. Zhou'], u'2016-10-31', u'Structure, function and dynamics of many biomolecular systems can be\ncharacterized by the energetic variational principle and the corresponding\nsystems of partial differential equations (PDEs). This principle allows us to\nfocus on the identification of essential energetic components, the optimal\nparametrization of energies, and the efficient computational implementation of\nenergy variation or minimization. Given the fact that complex biomolecular\nsystems are structurally non-uniform and their interactions occur through\ncontact interfaces, their free energies are associated with various interfaces\nas well, such as solute-solvent interface, molecular binding interface, lipid\ndomain interface, and membrane surfaces. This fact motivates the inclusion of\ninterface geometry, particular its curvatures, to the parametrization of free\nenergies. Applications of such interface geometry based energetic variational\nprinciples are illustrated through three concrete topics: the multiscale\nmodeling of biomolecular electrostatics and solvation that includes the\ncurvature energy of the molecular surface, the formation of microdomains on\nlipid membrane due to the geometric and molecular mechanics at the lipid\ninterface, and the mean curvature driven protein localization on membrane\nsurfaces. By further implicitly representing the interface using a phase field\nfunction over the entire domain, one can simulate the dynamics of the interface\nand the corresponding energy variation by evolving the phase field function,\nachieving significant reduction of the number of degrees of freedom and\ncomputational complexity. Strategies for improving the efficiency of\ncomputational implementations and for extending applications to coarse-graining\nor multiscale molecular simulations are outlined.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00610v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]

While the neuronal state\nis often modeled deterministically, experimental recordings show stochastic\nfluctuations, presumably driven by molecular noise from the underlying\nmicrophysical conditions. In turn, the firing of individual neurons gives rise\nto an electric field n extracellular space, also thought to affect the firing\npattern of nearby neurons.\n  We develop a multiscale model which combines a stochastic ion channel gating\nprocess taking place on the neuronal membrane, together with the propagation of\nan action potential along the neuronal structure.

[u'Three Perspectives on Complexity $-$ Entropy, Compression, Subsymmetry', ['Nithin Nagaraj', 'Karthi Balasubramanian'], u'2016-10-31', u'There is no single universally accepted definition of "Complexity". There are\nseveral perspectives on complexity and what constitutes complex behaviour or\ncomplex systems, as opposed to regular, predictable behaviour and simple\nsystems. In this paper, we explore the following perspectives on complexity:\n"effort-to-describe" (Shannon entropy $H$, Lempel-Ziv complexity $LZ$),\n"effort-to-compress" ($ETC$ complexity) and "degree-of-order" (Subsymmetry or\n$SubSym$). While Shannon entropy and $LZ$ are very popular and widely used,\n$ETC$ is a recently proposed measure for time series. In this paper, we also\npropose a novel normalized measure $SubSym$ based on the existing idea of\ncounting the number of subsymmetries or palindromes within a sequence. We\ncompare the performance of these complexity measures on the following tasks: a)\ncharacterizing complexity of short binary sequences of lengths 4 to 16, b)\ndistinguishing periodic and chaotic time series from 1D logistic map and 2D\nH\\\'{e}non map, and c) distinguishing between tonic and irregular spiking\npatterns generated from the "Adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire" neuron\nmodel.

[u'Reproduction Number And Asymptotic Stability For The Dynamics of a Honey\n  Bee Colony with Continuous Age Structure', ['Matthew Betti', 'Lindi Wahl', 'Mair Zamir'], u'2016-11-02', u'A system of partial differential equations is derived as a model for the\ndynamics of a honey bee colony with a continuous age distribution, and the\nsystem is then extended to include the effects of a simplified infectious\ndisease. In the disease-free case we analytically derive the equilibrium age\ndistribution within the colony and propose a novel approach for determining the\nglobal asymptotic stability of a reduced model. Furthermore, we present a\nmethod for determining the basic reproduction number $R_0$ of the infection;\nthe method can be applied to other age-structured disease models with\ninteracting susceptible classes. The results of asymptotic stability indicate\nthat a honey bee colony suffering losses will recover naturally so long as the\ncause of the losses is removed before the colony collapses.

[u'On the role of extrinsic noise in microRNA-mediated bimodal gene\n  expression', ['Marco Del Giudice', 'Stefano Bo', 'Silvia Grigolon', 'Carla Bosia'], u'2016-11-02', u"Several studies pointed out the relevance of extrinsic noise in molecular\nnetworks in shaping cell decision making and differentiation. Interestingly,\nbimodal distributions of gene expression levels, that may be a feature of\nphenotypic differentiation, are a common phenomenon in gene expression data.\nThe modes of the distribution often correspond to different physiological\nstates of the system. In this work we address the role of extrinsic noise in\nshaping bimodal gene distributions in the context of microRNA (miRNA)-mediated\nregulation, both with stochastic modelling and simulations. MiRNAs are small\nnoncoding RNA molecules that downregulate the expression of their target mRNAs.\nThe titrative nature of the interaction is sufficient to induce bimodal\ndistributions of the targets. We study the fluctuating miRNA transcription case\nto probe the effects of extrinsic noise on the system. We show that (i) bimodal\ntarget distributions can be obtained exploiting a noisy environment even in\ncase of small miRNA-target interaction strength, (ii) an increase in the\nextrinsic noise shifts the range of target transcription rates that allow\nbimodality towards higher values, (iii) the protein half-life may buffer\nbimodal mRNA preventing its distribution from becoming bimodal and that (iv) in\na noisy environment different targets may cross-regulate each other's bimodal\ndistribution when competing for a shared pool of miRNAs even if the miRNA\nregulation is small.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00666v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]

Here we investigate one such well-known pathway, involving mutually\nantagonistic signalling molecules (small GTPases Rac and Rho) that control the\nprotrusion and contraction of the cell edges (lamellipodia). Invasive melanoma\ncells were observed migrating on surfaces with topography (array of posts),\ncoated with adhesive molecules (fibronectin, FN) by Park et al., 2016. Several\ndistinct qualitative behaviors they observed included persistent polarity,\noscillation between the cell front and back, and random dynamics. To gain\ninsight into the link between intracellular and ECM signaling, we compared\nexperimental observations to a sequence of mathematical models encoding\ndistinct hypotheses. The successful model required several critical factors.\n(1) Competition of lamellipodia for limited pools of GTPases. (2) Protrusion /\ncontraction of lamellipodia influence ECM signaling.
