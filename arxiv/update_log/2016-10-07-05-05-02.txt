For example, one can easily download and study the connectomes,\nrestricted to the frontal lobes or just to the left precuneus of 96 subjects\nusing the data. Partially directed connectomes of 423 subjects are also\navailable for download.

[u'Bursting and Synchrony in Networks of Model Neurons', ['Christian Geier', 'Alexander Rothkegel', 'Christian E. Elger', 'Klaus Lehnertz'], u'2016-10-06', u'Bursting neurons are considered to be a potential cause of over-excitability\nand seizure susceptibility. The functional influence of these neurons in\nextended epileptic networks is still poorly understood. There is mounting\nevidence that the dynamics of neuronal networks is influenced not only by\nneuronal and synaptic properties but also by network topology. We investigate\nnumerically the influence of different neuron dynamics on global synchrony in\nneuronal networks with complex connection topologies.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01898v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'On the Centrality of the Focus in Human Epileptic Brain Networks', ['Christian Geier', 'Marie-Therese Kuhnert', 'Christian E. Elger', 'Klaus Lehnertz'], u'2016-10-06', u'There is increasing evidence for specific cortical and subcortical\nlarge-scale human epileptic networks to be involved in the generation, spread,\nand termination of not only primary generalized but also focal onset seizures.\nThe complex dynamics of such networks has been studied with methods of analysis\nfrom graph theory. In addition to investigating network-specific\ncharacteristics, recent studies aim to determine the functional role of single\nnodes---such as the epileptic focus---in epileptic brain networks and their\nrelationship to ictogenesis. Utilizing the concept of betweenness centrality to\nassess the importance of network nodes, previous studies reported the epileptic\nfocus to be of highest importance prior to seizures, which would support the\nnotion of a network hub that facilitates seizure activity. We performed a\ntime-resolved analysis of various aspects of node importance in epileptic brain\nnetworks derived from long-term, multi-channel, intracranial\nelectroencephalographic recordings from an epilepsy patient. Our preliminary\nfindings indicate that the epileptic focus is not consistently the most\nimportant network node, but node importance may drastically vary over time.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01894v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

We here use approaches from symbolic\nanalysis to investigate---in a time-resolved manner---weighted and directed,\nshort- to long-ranged interactions between various brain regions constituting\nthe epileptic network. Our observations point to complex spatial-temporal\ninterdependencies underlying the epileptic process and their role in the\ngeneration of epileptic seizures, despite the massive reduction of the complex\ninformation content of multi-day, multi-channel EEG recordings through\nsymbolisation.

[u'Neural correlates of self-generated imagery and cognition throughout the\n  sleep cycle', ['Kieran C. R. Fox', 'Manesh Girn'], u'2016-10-06', u'Humans have been aware for thousands of years that sleep comes in many forms,\naccompanied by different kinds of mental content. We review the first-person\nreport literature on the frequency and type of content experienced in various\nstages of sleep, showing that different sleep stages are dissociable at the\nsubjective level. We then relate these subjective differences to the growing\nliterature differentiating the various sleep stages at the neurophysiological\nlevel, including evidence from electrophysiology, neurochemistry, and\nfunctional neuroimaging. We suggest that there is emerging evidence for\nrelationships between sleep stage, neurophysiological activity, and subjective\nexperiences. Specifically, we emphasize that functional neuroimaging work\nsuggests a parallel between activation and deactivation of default network and\nvisual network brain areas and the varying frequency and intensity of imagery\nand dream mentation across sleep stages; additionally, frontoparietal control\nnetwork activity across sleep stages may parallel levels of cognitive control\nand meta-awareness. Together these findings suggest intriguing brain-mind\nisomorphisms and may serve as a first step toward a comprehensive understanding\nof the relationship between neurophysiology and psychology in sleep and\ndreaming.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01704v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'An inversion method based on random sampling for real-time MEG\n  neuroimaging', ['Annalisa Pascarella', 'Francesca Pitolli'], u'2016-10-05', u'The MagnetoEncephaloGraphy (MEG) has gained great interest in\nneurorehabilitation training due to its high temporal resolution. The challenge\nis to localize the active regions of the brain in a fast and accurate way. In\nthis paper we use an inversion method based on random spatial sampling to solve\nthe real-time MEG inverse problem. Several numerical tests on synthetic but\nrealistic data show that the method takes just a few hundredths of a second on\na laptop to produce an accurate map of the electric activity inside the brain.\nMoreover, it requires very little memory storage. For this reasons the random\nsampling method is particularly attractive in real-time MEG applications.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01636v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Partner selection supported by opaque reputation promotes cooperative\n  behavior', ['Valerio Capraro', 'Francesca Giardini', 'Daniele Vilone', 'Mario Paolucci'], u'2016-10-06', u"Reputation plays a major role in human societies, and it has been proposed as\nan explanation for the evolution of cooperation. While the majority of previous\nstudies equate reputation with a transparent and complete history of players'\npast decisions, in real life, reputations are often based on personal\nevaluations, and so they are often ambiguous and opaque. For example,\nreputation has become central in online systems, in which history of others'\npast actions is not available, and sources are unknown, as well as the metrics\nused for the evaluation. Using web-based experiments, we explore the extent to\nwhich obscure reputation works in isolating defectors, and whether it can\npromote cooperative behaviors. Our results show that subjects cooperate much\nless with low-reputation partners than with medium- or high-reputation ones,\neven if they know nothing about the way in which that reputation was gained.\nNext, we explore whether the mere awareness of being evaluated leads people to\nchange their behavior. We find that reputation without partner selection does\nnot promote cooperative behavior; that is, defectors do not turn into\ncooperators only for the sake of getting a positive reputation. Finally, in a\nthird study, we find that, when reputation is pivotal to selection, then a\nsubstantial proportion of would-be-defectors turn into cooperators. These\nresults provide insights on the way in which humans take into account\nreputation when selecting partners but also when knowing that they will be\nselected.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01993v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

Specimens for histological examination were collected from the\nesophageus, stomach and small intestine of the Nile monitor and processed for\nparaffin embedding. Sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin for\ngeneral morphology. Periodic Acid Schiff's (PAS) and Alcian Blue (AB) staining\nmethods were applied to detect the different types of the mucous con-tents of\nthe gastro-intestinal tract. Some paraffin sections were stained with Grimelius\nsilver impregnation technique for localization of the enteroendocrine cells.\nThe folded esophageal mucosa had ciliated columnar epithelium with mucous\nsecreting goblet cells, which stained positive with PAS and AB. The esophageal\nmucosa was folded and the lining epithelium was ciliated columnar epithelium\nwith mucous secreting goblet cells, which stained positive with PAS and AB. The\nstomach was divided into fundic and pyloric regions. The mucosa was thrown into\ngastric pits, into which the gastric glands opened. The surface epithelium was\nmucous secreting columnar cells and stained positive with PAS but negative with\nAB. The fundic gland was made by oxynticopeptic cells and few mucous cells,\nwhile the entire pyloric gland was made by mucous cells stained positive for\nboth PAS and AB. The small intestine showed many villi but occasional poorly\ndeveloped intestinal crypts were. The intestinal mucosa was lined with\nabsorptive columnar epithelium with goblet cells, which stained positive with\nPAS and AB. Enteroendocrine cells were of different shapes; rounded, spindle,\noval or pyramidal and were localized in the surface epithelium of the esophagus\nand small intestine, and among the cells of the gastric glands.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01717v1', ['Tissues and Organs'], []]
