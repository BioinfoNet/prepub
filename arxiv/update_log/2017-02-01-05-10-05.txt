[u'The effect of immigrant communities coming from higher incidence tuberculosis regions to a host country', ['Eugenio M. Rocha', 'Cristiana J. Silva', 'Delfim F. M. Torres'], u'2017-01-31', u'We introduce a new tuberculosis (TB) mathematical model, with $25$ state-space variables where $15$ are evolution disease states (EDSs), which generalises previous models and takes into account the (seasonal) flux of populations between a high incidence TB country (A) and a host country (B) with low TB incidence, where (B) is divided into a community (G) with high percentage of people from (A) plus the rest of the population (C). Contrary to some beliefs, related to the fact that agglomerations of individuals increase proportionally to the disease spread, analysis of the model shows that the existence of semi-closed communities are beneficial for the TB control from a global viewpoint. The model and techniques proposed are applied to a case-study with concrete parameters, which model the situation of Angola (A) and Portugal (B), in order to show its relevance and meaningfulness. Simulations show that variations of the transmission coefficient on the origin country has a big influence on the number of infected (and infectious) individuals on the community and the host country. Moreover, there is an optimal ratio for the distribution of individuals in (C) versus (G), which minimizes the reproduction number $R_0$. Such value does not give the minimal total number of infected individuals in all (B), since such is attained when the community (G) is completely isolated (theoretical scenario). Sensitivity analysis and curve fitting on $R_0$ and on EDSs are pursuit in order to understand the TB effects in the global statistics, by measuring the variability of the relevant parameters. We also show that the TB transmission rate $\\beta$ does not act linearly on $R_0$, as is common in compartment models where system feedback or group interactions do not occur. Further, we find the most important parameters for the increase of each EDS.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.09157v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Binets: fundamental building blocks for phylogenetic networks', ['Leo van Iersel', 'Vincent Moulton', 'Eveline de Swart', 'Taoyang Wu'], u'2017-01-31', u'Phylogenetic networks are a generalization of evolutionary trees that are used by biologists to represent the evolution of organisms which have undergone reticulate evolution. Essentially, a phylogenetic network is a directed acyclic graph having a unique root in which the leaves are labelled by a given set of species. Recently, some approaches have been developed to construct phylogenetic networks from collections of networks on 2- and 3-leaved networks, which are known as binets and trinets, respectively. Here we study in more depth properties of collections of binets, one of the simplest possible types of networks into which a phylogenetic network can be decomposed. More specifically, we show that if a collection of level-1 binets is compatible with some binary network, then it is also compatible with a binary level-1 network. Our proofs are based on useful structural results concerning lowest stable ancestors in networks. In addition, we show that, although the binets do not determine the topology of the network, they do determine the number of reticulations in the network, which is one of its most important parameters. We also consider algorithmic questions concerning binets. We show that deciding whether an arbitrary set of binets is compatible with some network is at least as hard as the well-known Graph Isomorphism problem. However, if we restrict to level-1 binets, it is possible to decide in polynomial time whether there exists a binary network that displays all the binets. We also show that to find a network that displays a maximum number of the binets is NP-hard, but that there exists a simple polynomial-time 1/3-approximation algorithm for this problem. It is hoped that these results will eventually assist in the development of new methods for constructing phylogenetic networks from collections of smaller networks.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08995v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Leaf-reconstructibility of phylogenetic networks', ['Leo van Iersel', 'Vincent Moulton'], u'2017-01-31', u'An important problem in evolutionary biology is to reconstruct the evolutionary history of a set $X$ of species. This history is often represented as a phylogenetic network, that is, a connected graph with leaves labelled by elements in $X$ (for example, an evolutionary tree), which is usually also binary, i.e. all vertices have degree 1 or 3. A common approach used in phylogenetics to build a phylogenetic network on $X$ involves constructing it from networks on subsets of $X$. Here we consider the question of which (unrooted) phylogenetic networks are leaf-reconstructible, i.e. which networks can be uniquely reconstructed from the set of networks obtained from it by deleting a single leaf (its $X$-deck). This problem is closely related to the (in)famous reconstruction conjecture in graph theory but, as we shall show, presents distinct challenges. We show that some large classes of phylogenetic networks are reconstructible from their $X$-deck. This includes phylogenetic trees, binary networks containing at least one non-trivial cut-edge, and binary level-4 networks (the level of a network measures how far it is from being a tree). We also show that for fixed $k$, almost all binary level-$k$ phylogenetic networks are leaf-reconstructible. As an application of our results, we show that a level-3 network $N$ can be reconstructed from its quarnets, that is, 4-leaved networks that are induced by $N$ in a certain recursive fashion. Our results lead to several interesting open problems which we discuss, including the conjecture that all phylogenetic networks with at least five leaves are leaf-reconstructible.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08982v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'High-throughput validation of ceRNA regulatory networks', ['Hua-Sheng Chiu', 'Maria Rodriguez Martinez', 'Mukesh Bansal', 'Aravind Subramanian', 'Todd R. Golub', 'Xuerui Yang', 'Pavel Sumazin', 'Andrea Califano'], u'2017-01-31', u'Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play multiple roles in tumor biology [1]. Interestingly, reports from multiple groups suggest that miRNA targets may be coupled through competitive stoichiometric sequestration [2]. Specifically, computational models predicted [3, 4] and experimental assays confirmed [5, 6] that miRNA activity is dependent on miRNA target abundance, and consequently, changes to the abundance of some miRNA targets lead to changes to the regulation and abundance of their other targets. The resulting indirect regulatory influence between miRNA targets resembles competition and has been dubbed competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) [5, 7, 8]. Recent studies have questioned the physiological relevance of ceRNA interactions [9], researchers ability to accurately predict these interactions [10], and the number of genes that are impacted by ceRNA interactions in specific cellular contexts [11]. Results: To address these concerns, we reverse engineered ceRNA networks (ceRNETs) in breast and prostate adenocarcinomas using context-specific TCGA profiles [12-14], and tested whether ceRNA interactions can predict the effects of RNAi-mediated gene silencing perturbations in PC3 and MCF7 cells. Our results, based on tests of thousands of inferred ceRNA interactions that are predicted to alter hundreds of cancer genes in each of the two tumor contexts, confirmed statistically significant effects for half of the predicted targets. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the expression of a significant fraction of cancer genes may be regulated by ceRNA interactions in each of the two tumor contexts.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.09104v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
[u'An Intermediate Level of Abstraction for Computational Systems Chemistry', ['Jakob L. Andersen', 'Christoph Flamm', 'Daniel Merkle', 'Peter F. Stadler'], u'2017-01-31', u'Computational techniques are required for narrowing down the vast space of possibilities to plausible prebiotic scenarios, since precise information on the molecular composition, the dominant reaction chemistry, and the conditions for that era are scarce. The exploration of large chemical reaction networks is a central aspect in this endeavour. While quantum chemical methods can accurately predict the structures and reactivities of small molecules, they are not efficient enough to cope with large-scale reaction systems. The formalization of chemical reactions as graph grammars provides a generative system, well grounded in category theory, at the right level of abstraction for the analysis of large and complex reaction networks. An extension of the basic formalism into the realm of integer hyperflows allows for the identification of complex reaction patterns, such as auto-catalysis, in large reaction networks using optimization techniques.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.09097v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
[u'Role of transcriptional bursts in cellular oscillations', ['Nahuel Almeira', 'Sebastian Risau Gusman'], u'2017-01-31', u'Genetic oscillators are present in the cells of many organisms and control several biological processes. The common feature of such oscillators is the presence of a protein which represses the transcription of its own gene. Recently, it has been shown that for many genes transcription is not a continuous process, but that it proceeds in bursts. We study here the relationship between bursty transcription and the robustness of protein oscillations. We concentrate on the temporal profile of mRNA production by studying regimes where this profile changes but the amount of mRNA produced is kept fixed. For systems with different degrees of cooperativity we show that in general bursts are associated more robust oscillations, but when they are too short and intense they can have the opposite effect. In other words, we show that, in terms of the regularity of the oscillations generated, there is an optimal value for the intensity of the bursts.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.09028v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
[u'The interdependent network of gene regulation and metabolism is robust where it needs to be', ['David F. Klosik', 'Anne Grimbs', 'Stefan Bornholdt', 'Marc-Thorsten Hutt'], u'2017-01-31', u'The major biochemical networks of the living cell, the network of interacting genes and the network of biochemical reactions, are highly interdependent, however, they have been studied mostly as separate systems so far. In the last years an appropriate theoretical framework for studying interdependent networks has been developed in the context of statistical physics. Here we study the interdependent network of gene regulation and metabolism of the model organism Escherichia coli using the theoretical framework of interdependent networks. In particular we aim at understanding how the biological system can consolidate the conflicting tasks of reacting rapidly to (internal and external) perturbations, while being robust to minor environmental fluctuations, at the same time. For this purpose we study the network response to localized perturbations and find that the interdependent network is sensitive to gene regulatory and protein-level perturbations, yet robust against metabolic changes. This first quantitative application of the theory of interdependent networks to systems biology shows how studying network responses to localized perturbations can serve as a useful strategy for analyzing a wide range of other interdependent networks.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.09002v1', ['Molecular Networks', 'Cell Behavior'], []]
[u'Alignment of dynamic networks', ['Vipin Vijayan', 'Dominic Critchlow', 'Tijana Milenkovic'], u'2017-01-30', u"Networks can model real-world systems in a variety of domains. Network alignment (NA) aims to find a node mapping that conserves similar regions between compared networks. NA is applicable to many fields, including computational biology, where NA can guide the transfer of biological knowledge from well- to poorly-studied species across aligned network regions. Existing NA methods can only align static networks. However, most complex real-world systems evolve over time and should thus be modeled as dynamic networks. We hypothesize that aligning dynamic network representations of evolving systems will produce superior alignments compared to aligning the systems' static network representations, as is currently done. For this purpose, we introduce the first ever dynamic NA method, DynaMAGNA++. This proof-of-concept dynamic NA method is an extension of a state-of-the-art static NA method, MAGNA++. Even though both MAGNA++ and DynaMAGNA++ optimize edge as well as node conservation across the aligned networks, MAGNA++ conserves static edges and similarity between static node neighborhoods, while DynaMAGNA++ conserves dynamic edges (events) and similarity between evolving node neighborhoods. For this purpose, we introduce the first ever measure of dynamic edge conservation and rely on our recent measure of dynamic node conservation. Importantly, the two dynamic conservation measures can be optimized using any state-of-the-art NA method and not just MAGNA++. We confirm our hypothesis that dynamic NA is superior to static NA, under fair comparison conditions, on synthetic and real-world networks, in computational biology and social network domains. DynaMAGNA++ is parallelized and it includes a user-friendly graphical interface.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08842v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
