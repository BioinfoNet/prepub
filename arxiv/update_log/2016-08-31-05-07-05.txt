[u'Cooperativity and modularity in protein folding', ['Masaki Sasai', 'George Chikenji', 'Tomoki P. Terada'], u'2016-08-30', u'A simple statistical mechanical model proposed by Wako and Sait$\\hat{\\rm o}$\nhas explained the aspects of protein folding surprisingly well. This model was\nsystematically applied to multiple proteins by Mu$\\tilde{\\rm n}$oz and Eaton\nand has since been referred to as the Wako-Sait$\\hat{\\rm o}$-Mu$\\tilde{\\rm\nn}$oz-Eaton (WSME) model. The success of the WSME model in explaining the\nfolding of many proteins has verified the hypothesis that the folding is\ndominated by native interactions, which makes the energy landscape globally\nbiased toward native conformation. Using the WSME and other related models,\nSait$\\hat{\\rm o}$ emphasized the importance of the hierarchical pathway in\nprotein folding; folding starts with the creation of contiguous segments having\na native-like configuration and proceeds as growth and coalescence of these\nsegments. The $\\phi$-values calculated for barnase with the WSME model\nsuggested that segments contributing to the folding nucleus are similar to the\nstructural modules defined by the pattern of native atomic contacts. The WSME\nmodel was extended to explain folding of multi-domain proteins having a complex\ntopology, which opened the way to comprehensively understanding the folding\nprocess of multi-domain proteins. The WSME model was also extended to describe\nallosteric transitions, indicating that the allosteric structural movement does\nnot occur as a deterministic sequential change between two conformations but as\na stochastic diffusive motion over the dynamically changing energy landscape.\nStatistical mechanical viewpoint on folding, as highlighted by the WSME model,\nhas been renovated in the context of modern methods and ideas, and will\ncontinue to provide insights on equilibrium and dynamical features of proteins.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08341v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'The relation of local entropy and information transfer suggests an\n  origin of isoflurane anesthesia effects in local information processing', ['Patricia Wollstadt', 'Kristin K. Sellers', 'Lucas Rudelt', 'Viola Priesemann', 'Axel Hutt', 'Flavio Frohlich', 'Michael Wibral'], u'2016-08-30', u'The disruption of coupling between brain areas has been suggested as the\nmechanism underlying loss of consciousness in anesthesia. This hypothesis has\nbeen tested previously by measuring information transfer between brain areas,\nand by taking reduced information transfer as a proxy for decoupling. Yet,\ninformation transfer is influenced by the amount of information available in\nthe information source such that transfer decreases even for unchanged coupling\nwhen less source information is available. Therefore, we reconsidered past\ninterpretations of reduced information transfer as a sign of decoupling, and\nasked if impaired local information processing leads to a loss of information\ntransfer. An important prediction of this alternative hypothesis is that\nchanges in locally available information (signal entropy) should be at least as\npronounced as changes in information transfer. We tested this prediction by\nrecording local field potentials in two ferrets - awake, and anesthetized with\nisoflurane at two concentrations (0.5 %, 1.0 %).\n  We found strong decreases in the source entropy under isoflurane in visual\narea V1 and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) - as predicted by the alternative\nhypothesis. The decrease in entropy was more pronounced in PFC compared to V1.\nIn addition, information transfer between V1 and PFC was reduced\nbidirectionally, but with a more pronounced decrease from PFC to V1. This links\nthe stronger decrease in information transfer to the stronger decrease in\nsource entropy - suggesting that the reduced source entropy reduces information\ntransfer. Thus, changes in information transfer under isoflurane seem to be a\nconsequence of changes in local processing more than of decoupling between\nbrain areas. Our results fit the observation that the synaptic targets of\nIsoflurane are located in local cortical circuits rather than on the synapses\nformed by interareal projections.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08387v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'A Compression-Complexity Measure of Integrated Information', ['Mohit Virmani', 'Nithin Nagaraj'], u'2016-08-23', u'Quantifying integrated information is a leading approach towards building a\nfundamental theory of consciousness. Integrated Information Theory (IIT) has\ngained attention in this regard due to its theoretically strong framework.\nHowever, it faces some limitations such as current state dependence,\ncomputationally expensive and inability to be applied to real brain data. On\nthe other hand, Perturbational Complexity Index (PCI) is a clinical measure for\ndistinguishing different levels of consciousness. Though PCI claims to capture\nthe functional differentiation and integration in brain networks (similar to\nIIT), its link to integrated information theories is rather weak. Inspired by\nthese two approaches, we propose a new measure - $\\Phi^C$ using a novel\ncompression-complexity perspective that serves as a bridge between the two, for\nthe first time. $\\Phi^C$ is founded on the principles of lossless data\ncompression based complexity measures which characterize the dynamical\ncomplexity of brain networks. $\\Phi^{C}$ exhibits following salient\ninnovations: (i) mathematically well bounded, (ii) negligible current state\ndependence unlike $\\Phi$, (iii) integrated information measured as\ncompression-complexity rather than as an infotheoretic quantity, and (iv)\nfaster to compute since number of atomic partitions scales linearly with the\nnumber of nodes of the network, thus avoiding combinatorial explosion. Our\ncomputer simulations show that $\\Phi^C$ has similar hierarchy to $<\\Phi>$ for\nseveral multiple-node networks and it demonstrates a rich interplay between\ndifferentiation, integration and entropy of the nodes of a network. $\\Phi^C$ is\na promising heuristic measure to characterize the quantity of integrated\ninformation (and hence a measure of quantity of consciousness) in larger\nnetworks like human brain and provides an opportunity to test the predictions\nof brain complexity on real neural data.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08450v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'The influence of the composition of tradeoffs on the generation of\n  differentiated cells', ['Andre Amado', 'Paulo R. A. Campos'], u'2016-08-30', u'We study the emergence of cell differentiation under the assumption of the\nexistence of a given number of tradeoffs between genes encoding different\nfunctions. In the model the viability of colonies is determined by the\ncapability of their lower level units to perform different functions, which is\nimplicitly determined by external chemical stimuli. Due to the existence of\ntradeoffs it can be evolutionarily advantageous to evolve the division of labor\nwhereby the cells can suppress their contributions to some of the activities\nthrough the activation of regulatory genes, which in its turn inflicts a cost\nin terms of fitness. Our simulation results show that cell differentiation is\nmore likely as the number of tradeoffs is increased but the outcome also\ndepends on their strength. We observe the existence of critical values for the\nminimum number of tradeoffs and their strength beyond that maximum cell\ndifferentiation can be attained. Remarkably, we observe the occurrence of a\nmaximum tradeoff strength beyond that the population is no longer viable\nimposing an upper tolerable level of constraint at the system. This tolerance\nis reduced as the number of tradeoffs grows.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08612v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Evolution of natal dispersal in spatially heterogenous environments', ['Robert Stephen Cantrell', 'Chris Cosner', 'Yuan Lou', 'Sebastian J. Schreiber'], u'2016-08-30', u'Understanding the evolution of dispersal is an important issue in\nevolutionary ecology. For continuous time models in which individuals disperse\nthroughout their lifetime, it has been shown that a balanced dispersal\nstrategy, which results in an ideal free distribution, is evolutionary stable\nin spatially varying but temporally constant environments. Many species,\nhowever, primarily disperse prior to reproduction (natal dispersal) and less\ncommonly between reproductive events (breeding dispersal). As demographic and\ndispersal terms combine in a multiplicative way for models of natal dispersal,\nrather than the additive way for the previously studied models, we develop new\nmathematical methods to study the evolution of natal dispersal for\ncontinuous-time and discrete-time models. A fundamental ecological dichotomy is\nidentified for the non-trivial equilibrium of these models: (i) the per-capita\ngrowth rates for individuals in all patches is equal to zero, or (ii)\nindividuals in some patches experience negative per-capita growth rates, while\nindividuals in other patches experience positive per-capita growth rates. The\nfirst possibility corresponds to an ideal-free distribution, while the second\npossibility corresponds to a "source-sink" spatial structure. We prove that\npopulations with a dispersal strategy leading to an ideal-free distribution\ndisplace populations with dispersal strategy leading to a source-sink spatial\nstructure. When there are patches which can not sustain a population,\nideal-free strategies can be achieved by sedentary populations, and we show\nthat these populations can displace populations with any irreducible dispersal\nstrategy. Collectively, these results support that evolution selects for natal\nor breeding dispersal strategies which lead to ideal-free distributions in\nspatially heterogenous, but temporally homogenous, environments.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08314v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

We are motivated by the notion of "templates\nand anchors" -- the biomechanical observation that animal motions are often\ngoverned by low dimensional dynamics -- and the growing applications in\nrobotics which desire means for making such biologically derived templates\ngovern the dynamics of robots. Our approach is fairly universal, in the sense\nthat a broad range of model reduction constructions must be normally hyperbolic\nif they are robust, and a broad range of such normally hyperbolic systems can\nbe produces from our construction.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08442v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]

[u'Systemic stability, cell differentiation, and evolution - A dynamical\n  systems perspective', ['Rudolf Hanel'], u'2016-08-30', u"Species or population that proliferate faster than others become dominant in\nnumbers. Catalysis allows catalytic sets within a molecular reaction network to\ndominate the non catalytic parts of the network by processing most of the\navailable substrate. As a consequence one may consider a 'catalytic fitness' of\nsets of molecular species. The fittest sets emerge as the expressed chemical\nbackbone or sub-network of larger chemical reaction networks employed by\norganisms. However, catalytic fitness depends on the systemic context and the\nstability of systemic dynamics. Unstable reaction networks would easily be\nreshaped or destroyed by fluctuations of the chemical environment. In this\npaper we therefore focus on recognizing systemic stability as an evolutionary\nselection criterion. In fact, instabilities of regulatory systems dynamics\nbecome predictive for associated evolutionary forces driving the emergence\nlarge reaction networks that avoid or control inherent instabilities. Systemic\ninstabilities can be identified and analyzed using relatively simple\nmathematical random networks models of complex regulatory systems. Using a\nstatistical ensemble approach one can identify fundamental causes of instable\ndynamics, infer evolutionary preferred network properties, and predict\nevolutionary emergent control mechanisms and their entanglement with cell\ndifferentiation processes. Surprisingly, what systemic stability tells us here\nis that cells (or other non-linear regulatory systems) never had to learn how\nto differentiate, but rather how to avoid and control differentiation. For\nexample, in this framework we can predict that regulatory systems will\nevolutionary favor networks where the number of catalytic enhancers is not\nlarger than the number of suppressors.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08498v1', ['Molecular Networks', 'Cell Behavior'], []]
