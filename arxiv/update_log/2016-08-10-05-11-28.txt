[u'The looping probability of random heteropolymers helps to understand the\n  scaling properties of biopolymers', ['Y. Zhan', 'L. Giorgetti', 'G. Tiana'], u'2016-08-09', u'Random heteropolymers are a minimal description of biopolymers and can\nprovide a theoretical framework to the investigate the formation of loops in\nbiophysical experiments. A two--state model provides a consistent and robust\nway to study the scaling properties of loop formation in polymers of the size\nof typical biological systems. Combining it with self--adjusting\nsimulated--tempering simulations, we can calculate numerically the looping\nproperties of several realizations of the random interactions within the chain.\nDifferently from homopolymers, random heteropolymers display at different\ntemperatures a continuous set of scaling exponents. The necessity of using\nself--averaging quantities makes finite--size effects dominant at low\ntemperatures even for long polymers, shadowing the length--independent\ncharacter of looping probability expected in analogy with homopolymeric\nglobules. This could provide a simple explanation for the small scaling\nexponents found in experiments, for example in chromosome folding.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.02795v1', ['Biomolecules', 'Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Closed-loop robots driven by short-term synaptic plasticity: Emergent\n  explorative vs. limit-cycle locomotion', ['Laura Martin', 'Bulcsu Sandor', 'Claudius Gros'], u'2016-08-09', u'We examine the hypothesis, that short-term synaptic plasticity (STSP) may\ngenerate self-organized motor patterns. We simulated sphere-shaped autonomous\nrobots, within the LPZRobots simulation package, containing three weights\nmoving along orthogonal internal rods. The position of a weight is controlled\nby a single neuron receiving excitatory input from the sensor, measuring its\nactual position, and inhibitory inputs from the other two neurons. The\ninhibitory connections are transiently plastic, following physiologically\ninspired STSP-rules.\n  We find that a wide palette of motion patterns are generated through the\ninteraction of STSP, robot, and environment (closed-loop configuration),\nincluding various forward meandering and circular motions, together with\nchaotic trajectories. The observed locomotion is robust with respect to\nadditional interactions with obstacles. In the chaotic phase the robot is\nseemingly engaged in actively exploring its environment. We believe that our\nresults constitute a concept of proof that transient synaptic plasticity, as\ndescribed by STSP, may potentially be important for the generation of motor\ncommands and for the emergence of complex locomotion patterns, adapting\nseamlessly also to unexpected environmental feedback.\n  Induced (by collisions) and spontaneous mode switching are observed. We find\nthat locomotion may follow transiently unstable limit cycles. The degeneracy of\nthe propagating state with respect to the direction of propagating is, in our\nanalysis, one of the drivings for the chaotic wandering, which partly involves\na smooth diffusion of the angle of propagation.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.02838v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'The need for more Lispers in bioinformatics', ['Bohdan B. Khomtchouk', 'Claes Wahlestedt'], u'2016-08-08', u'We address the need for expanding the presence of the Lisp family of\nprogramming languages in bioinformatics and computational biology research.\nCommon Lisp, the most comprehensive of the Lisp dialects, offers programmers\nunprecedented flexibility in treating code and data equivalently, and the\nability to extend the core language into any domain-specific territory. These\nfeatures of Common Lisp, commonly referred to as a "programmable programming\nlanguage," give bioinformaticians and computational biologists the power to\ncreate self-modifying code and build domain-specific languages (DSLs)\ncustomized to a specific application directly atop of the core language set.\nDSLs not only facilitate easier research problem formulation, but also aid in\nthe establishment of standards and best programming practices as applied to the\nspecific research field at hand. These standards may then be shared as\nlibraries with the bioinformatics community. Likewise, self-modifying code\n(i.e., code that writes its own code on the fly and executes it at run-time),\ngrants programmers unprecedented power to build increasingly sophisticated\nartificial intelligence (AI) systems, which may ultimately transform machine\nlearning and AI research in bioinformatics and computational biology.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.02621v1', ['Other'], []]
[u'Normal and pathological dynamics of platelets in humans', ['Gabriel P. Langlois', 'Morgan Craig', 'Antony R. Humphries', 'Michael C. Mackey', 'Joseph M. Mahaffy', 'Jacques Belair', 'Thibault Moulin', 'Sean R. Sinclair', 'Liangliang Wang'], u'2016-07-29', u'We develop a comprehensive mathematical model of platelet, megakaryocyte, and\nthrombopoietin dynamics in humans. We show that there is a single stationary\nsolution that can undergo a Hopf bifurcation, and use this information to\ninvestigate both normal and pathological platelet production, specifically\ncyclic thrombocytopenia. Carefully estimating model parameters from laboratory\nand clinical data, we then argue that a subset of parameters are involved in\nthe genesis of cyclic thrombocytopenia based on clinical information. We\nprovide excellent model fits to the existing data for both platelet counts and\nthrombopoietin levels by changing six parameters that have physiological\ncorrelates. Our results indicate that the primary change in cyclic\nthrombocytopenia is a major interference with or destruction of the\nthrombopoietin receptor with secondary changes in other processes, including\nimmune-mediated destruction of platelets and megakaryocyte deficiency and\nfailure in platelet production. This study makes a major contribution to the\nunderstanding of the origin of cyclic thrombopoietin as well as significantly\nextending the modeling of thrombopoiesis.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.02806v1', ['Tissues and Organs', 'Cell Behavior'], []]
[u'miR-34a-5p and miR-34a-3p contribute to the signaling pathway of p53 by\n  targeting overlapping sets of genes', ['Abderrahim Chafik'], u'2016-08-09', u'In contrary to the common belief that only one strand of the pre-miRNA is\nactive (usually the 5p one that is the more abundant) while the second one\n(miRNA*) is discarded, functional 5p and 3p have been observed for many miRNAs.\nAmong those miRNAs is miR-34a which is a target gene of the tumor suppressor\np53. In this paper we havw re-examined the role of miR-34a-5p and miR-34a-3p in\nthe signaling pathway of p53. We found that they target overlapping sets of\ngenes (MDM2 and THBS1). By a GO enrichment analysis we found that THBS1is\ninvolved in cancer and metastasis relevant processes. We have also deduce that\np53, MDM2 and miR-34a are linked by a type 1 incoherent FFL that represent a\nnovel mechanism for accelerating the response of p53 to external stress\nsignals.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.02756v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
[u'The role of CRKL in Breast Cancer Metastasis: Insights from Systems\n  Biology', ['Abderrahim Chafik'], u'2016-08-09', u'MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression\npost-transcriptionally. They are involved in key biological processes and then\nmay play a major role in the development of human diseases including cancer, in\nparticular their involvement in breast cancer metastasis has been confirmed.\nRecently, the authors of ref.(\\cite{key1} have found that miR-429 may have a\nrole in the inhibition of breast cancer metastasis and have identified its\ntarget gene CRKL as a potential candidate. In this paper, by using systems\nbiology tools we have shown that CRKL is involved in positive regulation of\nERK1/2 signaling pathway and contribute to the regulation of LYN through a\ntopological generalization of feed forward loop.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.02752v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
