[u'Effects of RNA sequence specificity in the electrostatic stabilization\n  of viruses', ['Gonca Erdemci-Tandogan', 'Jef Wagner', 'Paul van der Schoot', 'Rudolf Podgornik', 'Roya Zandi'], u'2016-05-16', u'Many single-stranded (ss) RNA viruses self assemble from capsid protein\nsubunits and the nucleic acid to form an infectious virion. It is believed that\nthe electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged RNA and the\npositively charged viral capsid proteins drive the encapsidation, although\nthere is growing evidence that the sequence of the viral RNA also plays a role\nin packaging. In particular the sequence will determine the possible secondary\nstructures that the ssRNA will take in solution. In this work, we use a mean\nfield theory to investigate how the secondary structure of the RNA combined\nwith electrostatic interactions affects the efficiency of assembly and\nstability of the assembled virions. We show that the secondary structure of RNA\nmay result in negative osmotic pressures while a linear polymer causes positive\nosmotic pressures for the same conditions. This may suggest that the branched\nstructure makes the RNA more effectively packaged and the virion more stable.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04978v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]

Steele', 'Jared D. Olson', 'Rajesh P. N. Rao', 'Jeffrey G. Ojemann'], u'2016-05-17', u'Neural correlates of movement planning onset and direction may be present in\nhuman electrocorticography in the signal dynamics of both motor and non-motor\ncortical regions. We use a three-stage model of jPCA reduced-rank hidden Markov\nmodel (jPCA-RR-HMM), regularized shrunken-centroid discriminant analysis (RDA),\nand LASSO regression to extract direction-sensitive planning information and\nmovement onset in an upper-limb 3D isometric force task in a human subject.\nThis mode achieves a relatively high true positive force-onset prediction rate\nof 60% within 250ms, and an above-chance 36% accuracy (17% chance) in\npredicting one of six planned 3D directions of isometric force using\npre-movement signals. We also find direction-distinguishing information up to\n400ms before force onset in the pre-movement signals, captured by electrodes\nplaced over the limb-ipsilateral dorsal premotor regions. This approach can\ncontribute to more accurate decoding of higher-level movement goals, at earlier\ntimescales, and inform sensor placement. Our results also contribute to further\nunderstanding of the spatiotemporal features of human motor planning.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05291v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Terrestrial Effects Of Nearby Supernovae In The Early Pleistocene', ['Brian C. Thomas', 'E. E. Engler', 'M. Kachelrie', 'A. L. Melott', 'A. C. Overholt', 'D. V. Semikoz'], u'2016-05-16', u'Recent results have strongly confirmed that multiple supernovae happened at\ndistances ~100 pc consisting of two main events: one at 1.7 to 3.2 million\nyears ago, and the other at 6.5 to 8.7 million years ago. These events are said\nto be responsible for excavating the Local Bubble in the interstellar medium\nand depositing 60Fe on Earth and the Moon. Other events are indicated by\neffects in the local cosmic ray (CR) spectrum. Given this updated and refined\npicture, we ask whether such supernovae are expected to have had substantial\neffects on the terrestrial atmosphere and biota. In a first cut at the most\nprobable cases, combining photon and cosmic ray effects, we find that a\nsupernova at 100 pc can have only a small effect on terrestrial organisms from\nvisible light, but tropospheric ionization due to the penetration of $\\geq$ TeV\ncosmic rays will increase by nearly an order of magnitude for thousands of\nyears, and irradiation by muons on the ground and in the upper ocean will\nincrease 20-fold, which will approximately triple the overall radiation load on\nterrestrial organisms. These effects make possible changes in climate and\nincreased cancer and mutation rates. Further research on the effects of these\nchanges is needed.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04926v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], [u'Washburn Univ.', u'NTNU', u'Univ.

[u'Heart Rate Variability and Respiration Signal as Diagnostic Tools for\n  Late Onset Sepsis in Neonatal Intensive Care Units', ['Yuan Wang', 'Guy Carrault', 'Alain Beuchee', 'Nathalie Costet', 'Huazhong Shu', 'Lotfi Senhadji'], u'2016-05-12', u'Apnea-bradycardia is one of the major clinical early indicators of late-onset\nsepsis occurring in approximately 7% to 10% of all neonates and in more than\n25% of very low birth weight infants in NICU. The objective of this paper was\nto determine if HRV, respiration and their relationships help to diagnose\ninfection in premature infants via non-invasive ways in NICU. Therefore, we\nimplement Mono-Channel (MC) and Bi-Channel (BC) Analysis in two groups: sepsis\n(S) vs. non-sepsis (NS). Firstly, we studied RR series not only by linear\nmethods: time domain and frequency domain, but also by non-linear methods:\nchaos theory and information theory. The results show that alpha Slow, alpha\nFast and Sample Entropy are significant parameters to distinguish S from NS.\nSecondly, the question about the functional coupling of HRV and nasal\nrespiration is addressed. Local linear correlation coefficient r2t,f has been\nexplored, while non-linear regression coefficient h2 was calculated in two\ndirections. It is obvious that r2t,f within the third frequency band (0.2<f<0.4\nHz) and h2 in two directions were complementary approaches to diagnose sepsis.\nThirdly, feasibility study is carried out on the candidate parameters selected\nfrom MC and BC respectively. We discovered that the proposed test based on\noptimal fusion of 6 features shows good performance with the largest AUC and a\nreduced probability of false alarm (PFA).', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05247v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]

In this work, we take the first step towards a global understanding\nof the regulatory networks organization by making a cartography of the\nfunctional architectures of diverse bacteria. Abasy (Across-bacteria systems)\nAtlas provides a comprehensive inventory of annotated functional systems,\nglobal network properties, and systems-level elements (global regulators,\nmodular genes shaping functional systems, basal machinery genes, and\nintermodular genes) predicted by the natural decomposition approach for\nreconstructed and meta-curated regulatory networks across a large range of\nbacteria, including pathogenically and biotechnologically relevant organisms.\nThe meta-curation of regulatory datasets provides the most complete and\nreliable set of regulatory interactions currently available. Abasy Atlas\ncontains systems and system-level elements for 50 regulatory networks\ncomprising 78,649 regulatory interactions covering 42 bacteria in nine taxa,\ncontaining 3,708 regulons and 1,776 systems. All this brings together a large\ncorpus of data that will surely inspire studies to generate hypothesis\nregarding the principles governing the evolution and organization of systems\nand the functional architectures controlling them.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04959v1', ['Molecular Networks', 'Genomics'], []]
