[u'Predictive coding in area V4: dynamic shape discrimination under partial occlusion', ['Hannah Choi', 'Anitha Pasupathy', 'Eric Shea-Brown'], u'2016-12-16', u'The primate visual system has an exquisite ability to discriminate partially occluded shapes. Recent electrophysiological recordings suggest that response dynamics in intermediate visual cortical area V4, shaped by feedback from prefrontal cortex (PFC), may play a key role. To probe the algorithms that may underlie these findings, we build and test a model of V4 and PFC interactions based on a hierarchical predictive coding framework. We propose that probabilistic inference occurs in two steps. Initially, V4 responses are driven solely by bottom-up sensory input and are thus strongly influenced by the level of occlusion. After a delay, V4 responses combine both feedforward input and feedback signals from the PFC; the latter reflect predictions made by PFC about the visual stimulus underlying V4 activity. We find that this model captures key features of V4 and PFC dynamics observed in experiments. Specifically, PFC responses are strongest for occluded stimuli and delayed responses in V4 are less sensitive to occlusion, supporting our hypothesis that the feedback signals from PFC underlie robust discrimination of occluded shapes. Thus, our study proposes that area V4 and PFC participate in hierarchical inference, with feedback signals encoding top-down predictions about occluded shapes.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05321v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Sojourn times and fixation dynamics in multi-player games with fluctuating environments', ['Joseph W. Baron', 'Tobias Galla'], u'2016-12-16', u'We study evolutionary multi-player games in finite populations, subject to fluctuating environments. The population undergoes a birth-death process with absorbing states, and the environment follows a Markovian process, resulting in a fluctuating payoff matrix for the evolutionary game. Our focus is on the fixation or extinction of a single mutant in a population of wildtypes. We show that the nonlinear nature of fitnesses in multi-player games gives rise to an intricate interplay of selection, genetic drift and environmental fluctuations. This generates effects not seen in simpler two-player games. To analyse trajectories towards fixation we analytically calculate sojourn times for general birth-death processes in populations of two types of individuals and in fluctuating environments.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05530v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Growth over time-correlated disorder: a spectral approach to Mean-field', ['Thomas Gueudre'], u'2016-12-16', u'We generalize a model of growth over a disordered environment, to a large class of It\\=o processes. In particular, we study how the microscopic properties of the noise influence the macroscopic growth rate. The present model can account for growth processes in large dimensions, and provides a bed to understand better the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. An additional mapping to the Schr\\"ordinger equation readily provides a set of disorders for which this model can be solved exactly. This mean-field approach exhibits interesting features, such as a freezing transition and an optimal point of growth, that can be studied in details, and gives yet another explanation for the occurrence of the $\\textit{Zipf law}$ in complex, well-connected systems.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05463v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Automatic time-series phenotyping using massive feature extraction', ['Ben D Fulcher', 'Nick S Jones'], u'2016-12-15', u'Across a far-reaching diversity of scientific and industrial applications, a general key problem involves relating the structure of time-series data to a meaningful outcome, such as detecting anomalous events from sensor recordings, or diagnosing patients from physiological time-series measurements like heart rate or brain activity. Currently, researchers must devote considerable effort manually devising, or searching for, properties of their time series that are suitable for the particular analysis problem at hand. Addressing this non-systematic and time-consuming procedure, here we introduce a new tool, hctsa, that selects interpretable and useful properties of time series automatically, by comparing implementations over 7700 time-series features drawn from diverse scientific literatures. Using two exemplar biological applications, we show how hctsa allows researchers to leverage decades of time-series research to quantify and understand informative structure in their time-series data.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05296v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Persistent vs. arrested spreading of biofilms at solid-gas interfaces - the role of surface forces', ['Sarah Trinschek', 'Karin John', 'Sigolene Lecuyer', 'Uwe Thiele'], u'2016-12-16', u'We introduce and analyze a model for osmotically spreading biofilm colonies at solid-air interfaces that includes wetting phenomena, i.e. surface forces. The model combines a hydrodynamic description for biologically passive liquid suspensions with bioactive processes. We show that wetting effects are responsible for a transition between persistent and arrested spreading and provide experimental evidence for the existence of this transition for Bacillus subtilis biofilms growing on agar substrates. In the case of arrested spreading, the biofilm is non-invasive albeit being biologically active. However, a small reduction in the surface tension of the biofilm is sufficient to induce spreading.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05450v1', ['Cell Behavior'], []]
