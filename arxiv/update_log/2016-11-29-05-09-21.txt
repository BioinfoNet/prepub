We develop a general physical framework describing the thermodynamic competition between different oligomeric states of membrane proteins. Using the mechanosensitive channel of large conductance as a model system, we show how the dominant oligomeric states of membrane proteins emerge from the interplay of protein concentration in the cell membrane, protein-induced lipid bilayer deformations, and direct monomer-monomer interactions. Our results suggest general physical mechanisms and principles underlying regulation of protein function via control of membrane protein oligomeric state.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09289v1', ['Biomolecules', 'Subcellular Processes'], []]
[u'Enhanced responsiveness in asynchronous irregular neuronal networks', ['Zahara Girones', 'Alain Destexhe'], u'2016-11-28', u'Networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons display asynchronous irregular (AI) states, where the activities of the two populations are balanced. At the single cell level, it was shown that neurons subject to balanced and noisy synaptic inputs can display enhanced responsiveness. We show here that this enhanced responsiveness is also present at the network level, but only when single neurons are in a conductance state and fluctuation regime consistent with experimental measurements. In such states, the entire population of neurons is globally influenced by the external input. We suggest that this network-level enhanced responsiveness constitute a low-level form of sensory awareness.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09089v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Dynamical Responses to External Stimuli for Both Cases of Excitatory and Inhibitory Synchronization in A Complex Neuronal Network', ['Sang-Yoon Kim', 'Woochang Lim'], u'2016-11-28', u'For studying how dynamical responses to external stimuli depend on the synaptic-coupling type, we consider two types of excitatory and inhibitory synchronization (i.e., synchronization via synaptic excitation and inhibition) in complex small-world networks of excitatory regular spiking (RS) pyramidal neurons and inhibitory fast spiking (FS) interneurons. For both cases of excitatory and inhibitory synchronization, effects of synaptic couplings on dynamical responses to external time-periodic stimuli $S(t)$ (applied to a fraction of neurons) are investigated by varying the driving amplitude $A$ of $S(t)$. Stimulated neurons are phase-locked to external stimuli for both cases of excitatory and inhibitory couplings. On the other hand, the stimulation effect on non-stimulated neurons depends on the type of synaptic coupling. The external stimulus $S(t)$ makes a constructive effect on excitatory non-stimulated RS neurons (i.e., it causes external phase lockings in the non-stimulated sub-population), while $S(t)$ makes a destructive effect on inhibitory non-stimulated FS interneurons (i.e., it breaks up original inhibitory synchronization in the non-stimulated sub-population). As results of these different effects of $S(t)$, the type and degree of dynamical response (e.g., synchronization enhancement or suppression), characterized by the dynamical response factor $D_f$ (given by the ratio of synchronization degree in the presence and absence of stimulus), are found to vary in a distinctly different way, depending on the synaptic-coupling type. Furthermore, we also measure the matching degree between the dynamics of the two sub-populations of stimulated and non-stimulated neurons in terms of a "cross-correlation" measure $M_c$. With increasing $A$, based on $M_c$, we discuss the cross-correlations between the two sub-populations, affecting the dynamical responses to $S(t)$.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09024v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Polysemy Effects and Chronological Memory', ['Francesco Fumarola'], u'2016-11-27', u"The existence of a polysemy effect in episodic memory is demonstrated through an analysis of data from the experiments of Lohnas et al. (2015) and Healey and Kahana (2016). Three word-length related features are reported: (1) the average distance between the serial positions of consecutively recalled words is an increasing function of the second word's length; (2) the recall of words in the order in which they were presented is more likely to occur for shorter words; (3) longer words are easier to recall than shorter words from the same list. These phenomena are reproduced by modeling the fact that shorter words have a larger number of meanings (polysemy). This is shown to be at the root of our tendency to recall verbal sequences in forward order, and a conjecture is put forth regarding the general methods we employ to store information on the chronology of events.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08928v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'A Simple Model of Attentional Blink', ['Nadav Amir', 'Israel Nelken', 'Naftali Tishby'], u'2016-11-27', u'The attentional blink (AB) effect is the reduced ability of subjects to report a second target stimuli (T2) among a rapidly presented series of non-target stimuli, when it appears within a time window of about 200-500 ms after a first target (T1). We present a simple dynamical systems model explaining the AB as resulting from the temporal response dynamics of a stochastic, linear system with threshold, whose output represents the amount of attentional resources allocated to the incoming sensory stimuli. The model postulates that the available attention capacity is limited by activity of the default mode network (DMN), a correlated set of brain regions related to task irrelevant processing which is known to exhibit reduced activation following mental training such as mindfulness meditation. The model provides a parsimonious account relating key findings from the AB, DMN and meditation research literature, and suggests some new testable predictions.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08913v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Functional Alignment with Anatomical Networks is Associated with Cognitive Flexibility', ['John D. Medaglia', 'Weiyu Huang', 'Elisabeth A. Karuza', 'Sharon L. Thompson-Schill', 'Alejandro Ribeiro', 'Danielle S. Bassett'], u'2016-11-26', u'Cognitive flexibility describes the human ability to switch between modes of mental function to achieve goals. Mental switching is accompanied by transient changes in brain activity, which must occur atop an anatomical architecture that bridges disparate cortical and subcortical regions by underlying white matter tracts. However, an integrated perspective regarding how white matter networks might constrain brain dynamics during cognitive processes requiring flexibility has remained elusive. To address this challenge, we applied emerging tools from graph signal processing to decompose BOLD signals based on diffusion imaging tractography in 28 individuals performing a perceptual task that probed cognitive flexibility. We found that the alignment between functional signals and the architecture of the underlying white matter network was associated with greater cognitive flexibility across subjects. Signals with behaviorally-relevant alignment were concentrated in the basal ganglia and anterior cingulate cortex, consistent with cortico-striatal mechanisms of cognitive flexibility. Importantly, these findings are not accessible to unimodal analyses of functional or anatomical neuroimaging alone. Instead, by taking a generalizable and concise reduction of multimodal neuroimaging data, we uncover an integrated structure-function driver of human behavior.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08751v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Towards a new quantum cognition model', ['Riccardo Franco'], u'2016-11-23', u'This article presents a new quantum-like model for cognition explicitly based on knowledge. It is shown that this model, called QKT (quantum knowledge-based theory), is able to coherently describe some experimental results that are problematic for the prior quantum-like decision models. In particular, I consider the experimental results relevant to the post-decision cognitive dissonance, the problems relevant to the question order effect and response replicability, and those relevant to the grand-reciprocity equations. A new set of postulates is proposed, which evidence the different meaning given to the projectors and to the quantum states. In the final part, I show that the use of quantum gates can help to better describe and understand the evolution of quantum-like models.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09212v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'The spatial dynamics of ecosystem engineers', ['Caroline Franco', 'Jose F. Fontanari'], u'2016-11-28', u'The changes on abiotic features of ecosystems have rarely been taken into account by population dynamics models, which typically focus on trophic and competitive interactions between species. However, understanding the population dynamics of organisms that must modify their habitats in order to survive, the so-called ecosystem engineers, requires the explicit incorporation of abiotic interactions in the models. Here we study a model of ecosystem engineers that is discrete both in space and time, and where the engineers and their habitats are arranged in patches fixed to the sites of regular lattices. The growth of the engineer population is modeled by Ricker equation with a density-dependent carrying capacity that is given by the number of modified habitats. A diffusive dispersal stage ensures that a fraction of the engineers move from their birth patches to neighboring patches. We find that dispersal influences the metapopulation dynamics only in the case that the local or single-patch dynamics exhibits chaotic behavior. In that case, it can suppress the chaotic behavior and avoid extinctions in the regime of large intrinsic growth rate of the population.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09283v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

Based on interpreting the payoff of players as fitness, dynamic landscape models are proposed. The modeling procedure is carried out for Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) and Snowdrift (SD) games that both use either birth-death (BD) or death-birth (DB) strategy updating. With the main focus on using dynamic fitness landscapes as an alternative tool for analyzing coevolutionary games, landscape measures such as modality, ruggedness and information content are computed and analyzed. In addition, fixation properties of the games and quantifiers characterizing the network of interaction are calculated numerically. Relations are established between landscape properties expressed by landscape measures and quantifiers of coevolutionary game dynamics such as fixation probabilities, fixation times and network properties", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09149v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Energy intake functions of ectotherms and endotherms derived from their body mass growth', ['Jan Werner', 'Nikolaos Sfakianakis', 'Alan Rendall', 'Eva Maria Griebeler'], u'2016-11-28', u'How animals allocate energy to different body functions is still not completely understood and a challenging topic until recently. Here, we investigate in more detail the allocation of energy intake to growth, reproduction or heat production by developing energy budget models for ectothermic and endothermic vertebrates using a mathematical approach. We calculated energy intake functions of ectotherms and endotherms derived from their body mass growth. We show that our energy budget model produces energy intake patterns and distributions as observed in ectothermic and endothermic species. Our results comply consistently with some empirical studies that in endothermic species, like birds and mammals, energy is used for heat production instead of growth. Our model additionally offers an explanation on known differences in absolute energy intake between ectothermic fish and reptiles and endothermic birds and mammals. From a mathematical point of view, the model comes in two equivalent formulations, a differential and an integral one. It is derived from a discrete level approach, and it is shown to be well-posed and to attain a unique solution for (almost) every parameter set. Numerically, the integral formulation of the model is considered as an inverse problem with unknown parameters that are estimated using a series of experiments/realistic data.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09052v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

Several instances in which Stegosaurus specimens have been confused with their distinct, hypothetical mirror-image forms are highlighted.

[u'The Phillip Island penguin parade (a mathematical treatment)', ['Serena Dipierro', 'Luca Lombardini', 'Pietro Miraglio', 'Enrico Valdinoci'], u'2016-11-26', u'We present a simple mathematical formulation to describe the little penguins parade in Phillip Island. We observed that penguins have the tendency to waddle back and forth on the shore to create a sufficiently large group and then walk home compactly together. The mathematical framework that we introduce describes this phenomenon, by taking into account natural parameters, such as the sight of the penguins, their cruising speed and the possible fear of animals. On the one hand, this favors the formation of rafts of penguins but, on the other hand, this may lead to the panic of isolated and exposed individuals. The model that we propose is based on a set of ordinary differential equations. Due to the discontinuous behavior of the speed of the penguins, the mathematical treatment (to get existence and uniqueness of the solution) is based on a stop-and-go procedure. We use this setting to provide rigorous examples in which at least some penguins manage to safely return home (there are also cases in which some penguins freeze due to panic). To facilitate the intuition of the model, we also present some simple numerical simulations that can be compared with the actual movement of the penguins parade.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08715v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

[u'Multiple Signal Classification Algorithm (MUSICAL) for super-resolution fluorescence microscopy', ['Krishna Agarwal', 'Radek Machan'], u'2016-11-28', u'Super-resolution microscopy is providing unprecedented insights into biology by resolving details much below the diffraction limit. State-of-the-art Single Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM) techniques for super-resolution are restricted by long acquisition and computational times, or the need of special fluorophores or chemical environments. Here, we propose a novel statistical super-resolution technique of wide-field fluorescence microscopy called MUltiple SIgnal Classification ALgorithm (MUSICAL) which has several advantages over SMLM techniques. MUSICAL provides resolution down to at least 50 nm, has low requirements on number of frames and excitation power and works even at high fluorophore concentrations. Further, it works with any fluorophore that exhibits blinking on the time scale of the recording. We compare imaging results of MUSICAL with SMLM and four contemporary statistical super-resolution methods for experiments of in-vitro actin filaments and datasets provided by independent research groups. Results show comparable or superior performance of MUSICAL.
