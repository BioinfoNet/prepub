[u'Supporting novel biomedical research via multilayer collaboration\n  networks', ['Konstantin Kuzmin', 'Xiaoyan Lu', 'Partha Sarathi Mukherjee', 'Juntao Zhuang', 'Chris Gaiteri', 'Boleslaw K Szymanski'], u'2016-10-28', u'The value of research containing novel combinations of molecules can be seen\nin many innovative and award-winning research programs. Despite calls to use\ninnovative approaches to address common diseases, an increasing majority of\nresearch funding goes toward "safe" incremental research. Counteracting this\ntrend by nurturing novel and potentially transformative scientific research is\nchallenging, it must be supported in competition with established research\nprograms. Therefore, we propose a tool that helps to resolve the tension\nbetween safe but fundable research vs. high-risk but potentially\ntransformational research. It does this by identifying hidden overlapping\ninterest around novel molecular research topics. Specifically, it identifies\npaths of molecular interactions that connect research topics and hypotheses\nthat would not typically be associated, as the basis for scientific\ncollaboration. Because these collaborations are related to the scientists\'\npresent trajectory, they are low risk and can be initiated rapidly. Unlike most\nincremental steps, these collaborations have the potential for leaps in\nunderstanding, as they reposition research for novel disease applications. We\ndemonstrate the use of this tool to identify scientists who could contribute to\nunderstanding the cellular role of genes with novel associations with\nAlzheimer\'s disease, which have not been thoroughly characterized, in part due\nto the funding emphasis on established research.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09253v1', ['Biomolecules', 'Quantitative Methods', 'Molecular Networks'], []]
[u'The coordinate-based meta-analysis of neuroimaging data', ['Pantelis Samartsidis', 'Silvia Montagna', 'Thomas E. Nichols', 'Timothy D. Johnson'], u'2016-10-28', u'Neuroimaging meta-analysis is an area of growing interest in statistics. The\nspecial characteristics of neuroimaging data render classical meta-analysis\nmethods inapplicable and therefore new methods have been developed. We review\nexisting methodologies, explaining the benefits and drawbacks of each. A\ndemonstration on a real dataset of emotion studies is included. We discuss some\nstill-open problems in the field to highlight the need for future research.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09294v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Noise-induced interspike interval correlations and spike train\n  regularization in spike-triggered adapting neurons', ['Eugenio Urdapilleta'], u'2016-10-28', u'Spike generation in neurons produces a temporal point process, whose\nstatistics is governed by intrinsic phenomena and the external incoming inputs\nto be coded. In particular, spike-evoked adaptation currents support a slow\ntemporal process that conditions spiking probability at the present time\naccording to past activity. In this work, we study the statistics of interspike\ninterval correlations arising in such non-renewal spike trains, for a neuron\nmodel that reproduces different spike modes in a small adaptation scenario. We\nfound that correlations are stronger as the neuron fires at a particular firing\nrate, which is defined by the adaptation process. When set in a subthreshold\nregime, the neuron may sustain this particular firing rate, and thus induce\ncorrelations, by noise. Given that, in this regime, interspike intervals are\nnegatively correlated at any lag, this effect surprisingly implies a reduction\nin the variability of the spike count statistics at a finite noise intensity.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09193v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Analysis of a growth model inspired by Gompertz and Korf laws, and an\n  analogous birth-death process', ['Antonio Di Crescenzo', 'Serena Spina'], u'2016-10-28', u'We propose a new deterministic growth model which captures certain features\nof both the Gompertz and Korf laws. We investigate its main properties, with\nspecial attention to the correction factor, the relative growth rate, the\ninflection point, the maximum specific growth rate, the lag time and the\nthreshold crossing problem. Some data analytic examples and their performance\nare also considered. Furthermore, we study a stochastic counterpart of the\nproposed model, that is a linear time-inhomogeneous birth-death process whose\nmean behaves as the deterministic one. We obtain the transition probabilities,\nthe moments and the population ultimate extinction probability for this\nprocess. We finally treat the special case of a simple birth process, which\nbetter mimics the proposed growth model.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09297v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Simulating Organogenesis in COMSOL: Phase-Field Based Simulations of\n  Embryonic Lung Branching Morphogenesis', ['Lucas Daniel Wittwer', 'Roberto Croce', 'Sebastian Aland', 'Dagmar Iber'], u'2016-10-28', u'Organogenesis has been studied for decades, but fundamental questions\nregarding the control of growth and shape remain unsolved. We have recently\nshown that of all proposed mathematical models only ligand-receptor based\nTuring models successfully reproduce the experimentally determined growth\nfields of the embryonic lung and thus provide a mechanism for growth control\nduring embryonic lung development. Turing models are based on at least two\ncoupled non-linear reaction-diffusion equations. In case of the lung model, at\nleast two distinct layers (mesenchyme and epithelium) need to be considered\nthat express different components (ligand and receptor, respectively). The\nArbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) method has previously been used to solve\nthis Turing system on growing and deforming (branching) domains, where\noutgrowth occurs proportional to the strength of ligand-receptor signalling.\nHowever, the ALE method requires mesh deformations that eventually limit its\nuse. Therefore, we incorporate the phase field method to simulate 3D embryonic\nlung branching with COMSOL.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09189v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]

Considering flapping flight in an unsteady wind environment with a\nperiodically varying lateral velocity component, we show that body rotations\nexperienced by flapping wing fliers result in the reorientation of the\naerodynamic force vector that can render a substantial cumulative deficit in\nthe vertical force. We derive quantitative estimates of the body roll amplitude\nand the related energetic requirements to maintain the weight support in free\nflight under such conditions. We conduct force measurements of a miniature\nhummingbird-inspired robotic flapper and numerical simulations of a bumblebee.\nIn both cases, we demonstrate the loss of weight support due to body roll\nrotations. Using semi-restrained flight measurements, we demonstrate the\nincreased power requirements to maintain altitude in unsteady winds, achieved\nby increasing the flapping frequency. Flapping fliers may increase their\nflapping frequency as well as the stroke amplitude to produce the required\nincrease in aerodynamic force, both of these two types of compensatory control\nrequiring additional energetic cost. We analyze the existing data from\nexperiments on animals flying in von K\\'arm\\'an streets and find reasonable\nagreement with the proposed theoretical model.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09101v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]

Two basic preliminary results emerge from our work (a) the free\nexploration is super-diffusive and (b) ants tend to turn more frequently to the\nleft than to the right -so we call them "let-handed"-.

Surgical management is offered when\nnonoperative options have not adequately relieved symptoms. We performed PubMed\nliterature search with the word 'spondylolisthesis', and updated till September\n18, 2016. We selected original research data involving surgical treatment of\ndegenerative spondylolisthesis, and in total there were n articles, including\ndata reported from Japan (n=37 series), South Korea (n=11 series), mainland\nChina (n=5 series), and ROC (Taiwan, n=3 series), America (n=20 series), Europe\n(n=23 series). The mean age of each study were extracted and used a single\nentry. We tried our best to filter out double/multiple reported data. Our\nresults showed the median age of degenerative spondylolisthesis patients\nunderwent surgical treatment was 66 years in Japan, 60 years in South Korea, 59\nyears in mainland China, 59 years in ROC (Taiwan), 65 years in USA, and 66\nyears in Europe. This study indicates Japan and South Korea may have different\nsurgical practice pattern. It will be of interested to investigate whether more\nproportion of degenerative spondylolisthesis patients have been treated\nsurgically in South Korea than in Japan.
