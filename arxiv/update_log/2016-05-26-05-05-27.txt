[u'Force spectroscopy in studying infection', ['Zhaokun Zhou', 'Mark C. Leake'], u'2016-05-25', u'Biophysical force spectroscopy tools - for example optical tweezers, magnetic\ntweezers, atomic force microscopy, - have been used to study elastic,\nmechanical, conformational and dynamic properties of single biological\nspecimens from single proteins to whole cells to reveal information not\naccessible by ensemble average methods such as X-ray crystallography, mass\nspectroscopy, gel electrophoresis and so on. Here we review the application of\nthese tools on a range of infection-related questions from antibody-inhibited\nprotein processivity to virus-cell adhesion. In each case we focus on how the\ninstrumental design tailored to the biological system in question translates\ninto the functionality suitable for that particular study. The unique insights\nthat force spectroscopy has gained to complement knowledge learned through\npopulation averaging techniques in interrogating biomolecular details prove to\nbe instrumental in therapeutic innovations such as those in structure-based\ndrug design.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07792v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Designing a single-molecule biophysics tool for characterizing DNA\n  damage for techniques that kill infectious pathogens through DNA damage\n  effects', ['Helen Miller', 'Adam J. M. Wollman', 'Mark C. Leake'], u'2016-05-25', u'Antibiotics such as the quinolones and fluoroquinolones kill bacterial\npathogens ultimately through DNA damage. They target the essential type IIA\ntopoisomerases in bacteria by stabilising the normally transient double strand\nbreak state which is created to modify the supercoiling state of the DNA. Here\nwe discuss the development of these antibiotics and their method of action.\nExisting methods for DNA damage visualisation, such as the comet assay and\nimmunofluorescence imaging can often only be analysed qualitatively and this\nanalysis is subjective. We describe a putative single-molecule fluorescence\ntechnique for quantifying DNA damage via the total fluorescence intensity of a\nDNA origami tile fully saturated with an intercalating dye, along with the\noptical requirements for how to implement these into a light microscopy imaging\nsystem capable of single-molecule millisecond timescale imaging. This system\npromises significant improvements in reproducibility of the quantification of\nDNA damage over traditional techniques.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07789v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'A maximum-caliber approach to predicting perturbed folding kinetics due\n  to mutations', ['Vincent A. Voelz', 'Guangfeng Zhou', 'Hongbin Wan'], u'2016-05-25', u'We present a maximum-caliber method for inferring transition rates of a\nMarkov State Model (MSM) with perturbed equilibrium populations, given\nestimates of state populations and rates for an unperturbed MSM. It is similar\nin spirit to previous approaches but given the inclusion of prior information\nit is more robust and simple to implement. We examine its performance in simple\nbiased diffusion models of kinetics, and then apply the method to predicting\nchanges in folding rates for several highly non-trivial protein folding systems\nfor which non-native interactions play a significant role, including (1)\ntryptophan variants of GB1 hairpin, (2) salt-bridge mutations of Fs peptide\nhelix, and (3) MSMs built from ultra-long folding trajectories of FiP35 and GTT\nvariants of WW domain. In all cases, the method correctly predicts changes in\nfolding rates, suggesting the wide applicability of maximum-caliber approaches\nto efficiently predict how mutations perturb protein conformational dynamics.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07731v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Instability to a heterogeneous oscillatory state in randomly connected\n  recurrent networks with delayed interactions', ['Celian Bimbard', 'Erwan Ledoux', 'Srdjan Ostojic'], u'2016-05-25', u'Oscillatory dynamics are ubiquitous in biological networks. Possible sources\nof oscillations are well understood in low-dimensional systems, but have not\nbeen fully explored in high-dimensional networks. Here we study large networks\nconsisting of randomly coupled rate units. We identify a novel type of\nbifurcation in which a continuous part of the spectrum crosses the instability\nline at non-zero-frequency. This bifurcation occurs when the interactions are\ndelayed and partially anti-symmetric, and leads to a heterogeneous oscillatory\nstate in which oscillations are apparent in the activity of individual units,\nbut not on the population-average level.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07977v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Games of multicellularity', ['Kamran Kaveh', 'Carl Veller', 'Martin A. Nowak'], u'2016-05-25', u"Evolutionary game dynamics are often studied in the context of different\npopulation structures. Here we propose a new population structure that is\ninspired by simple multicellular life forms. In our model, cells reproduce but\ncan stay together after reproduction. They reach complexes of a certain size,\nn, before producing single cells again. The cells within a complex derive\npayoff from an evolutionary game by interacting with each other. The\nreproductive rate of cells is proportional to their payoff. We consider all\ntwo-strategy games. We study deterministic evolutionary dynamics with\nmutations, and derive exact conditions for selection to favor one strategy over\nanother. Our main result has the same symmetry as the well-known sigma\ncondition, which has been proven for stochastic game dynamics and weak\nselection. For a maximum complex size of n=2 our result holds for any intensity\nof selection. For n > 2 it holds for weak selection. As specific examples we\nstudy the prisoner's dilemma and hawk-dove games. Our model advances\ntheoretical work on multicellularity by allowing for frequency-dependent\ninteractions within groups.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07690v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Eco-evolutionary dynamics of social dilemmas', ['Chaitanya S. Gokhale', 'Christoph Hauert'], u'2016-05-24', u"Social dilemmas are an integral part of social interactions. Cooperative\nactions, ranging from secreting extra-cellular products in microbial\npopulations to donating blood in humans, are costly to the actor and hence\ncreate an incentive to shirk and avoid the costs. Nevertheless, cooperation is\nubiquitous in nature. Both costs and benefits often depend non-linearly on the\nnumber and types of individuals involved -- as captured by idioms such as `too\nmany cooks spoil the broth' where additional contributions are discounted, or\n`two heads are better than one' where cooperators synergistically enhance the\ngroup benefit. Interaction group sizes may depend on the size of the population\nand hence on ecological processes. This results in feedback mechanisms between\necological and evolutionary processes, which jointly affect and determine the\nevolutionary trajectory. Only recently combined eco-evolutionary processes\nbecame experimentally tractable in microbial social dilemmas. Here we analyse\nthe evolutionary dynamics of non-linear social dilemmas in settings where the\npopulation fluctuates in size and the environment changes over time. In\nparticular, cooperation is often supported and maintained at high densities\nthrough ecological fluctuations. Moreover, we find that the combination of the\ntwo processes routinely reveals highly complex dynamics, which suggests common\noccurrence in nature.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07656v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Analysis of differential splicing suggests different modes of short-term\n  splicing regulation', ['Hande Topa', 'Antti Honkela'], u'2016-05-25', u'Motivation: Alternative splicing is an important mechanism in which the\nregions of pre-mRNAs are differentially joined in order to form different\ntranscript isoforms. Alternative splicing is involved in the regulation of\nnormal physiological functions but also linked to the development of diseases\nsuch as cancer. We analyse differential expression and splicing using RNA-seq\ntime series in three different settings: overall gene expression levels,\nabsolute transcript expression levels and relative transcript expression\nlevels.\n  Results: Using estrogen receptor $\\alpha$ signalling response as a model\nsystem, our Gaussian process (GP)-based test identifies genes with differential\nsplicing and/or differentially expressed transcripts. We discover genes with\nconsistent changes in alternative splicing independent of changes in absolute\nexpression and genes where some transcripts change while others stay constant\nin absolute level. The results suggest classes of genes with different modes of\nalternative splicing regulation during the experiment.\n  Availability: R and Matlab codes implementing the method are available at\nhttps://github.com/PROBIC/diffsplicing .

Here, we describe how these methods can be extended to larger\neukaryotic, yeast cells, which contain sub-cellular compartments. We describe\nhow to obtain single-molecule microscopy data but also how to analyse these\ndata to track and obtain the stoichiometry of molecular complexes diffusing in\nthe cell. We chose glucose mediated signal transduction of live yeast cells as\nthe system to demonstrate these single-molecule techniques as transcriptional\nregulation is fundamentally a single molecule problem - a single repressor\nprotein binding a single binding site in the genome can dramatically alter\nbehaviour at the whole cell and population level.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07797v1', ['Subcellular Processes'], []]

Leake'], u'2016-05-25', u'The method of action of many antibiotics is to interfere with DNA replication\n- quinolones trap DNA gyrase and topoisomerase proteins onto DNA while\nmetronidazole causes single and double stranded breaks in DNA. To understand\nhow bacteria respond to these drugs, it is important to understand the repair\nprocesses utilised when DNA replication is blocked. We have used tandem lac\noperators inserted into the chromosome bound by fluorescently labelled lac\nrepressors as a model protein block to replication in E. coli. We have used\ndual-colour, alternating-laser, single-molecule narrowfield microscopy to\nquantify the amount of operator at the block and simultaneously image\nfluorescently labelled DNA polymerase.

[u'Hybrid Markov-mass action law for cell activation by rare binding events', ['C. Guerrier D. Holcman'], u'2016-05-24', u'The binding of molecules, ions or proteins to specific target sites is a\ngeneric step for cell activation. However, this step relies on rare events\nwhere stochastic particles located in a large bulk are searching for small and\noften hidden targets and thus remains difficult to study. We present here a\nhybrid discrete-continuum model where the large ensemble of particles is\ndescribed by mass-action laws. The rare discrete binding events are modeled by\na Markov chain for the encounter of a finite number of small targets by few\nBrownian particles, for which the arrival time is Poissonian. This model is\napplied for predicting the time distribution of vesicular release at neuronal\nsynapses that remains elusive. This release is triggered by the binding of few\ncalcium ions that can originate either from the synaptic bulk or from the\ntransient entry through calcium channels. We report that the distribution of\nrelease time is bimodal although triggered by a single fast action potential:\nwhile the first peak follows a stimulation, the second corresponds to the\nrandom arrival over much longer time of ions located in the bulk to small\nbinding targets. To conclude, the present multiscale stochastic chemical\nreaction modeling allows studying cellular events based on integrating discrete\nmolecular events over various time scales.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07675v1', ['Subcellular Processes'], []]
