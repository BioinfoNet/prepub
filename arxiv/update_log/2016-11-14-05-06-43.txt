[u'Assembly pointers for variable binding in networks of spiking neurons', ['Robert Legenstein', 'Christos H. Papadimitriou', 'Santosh Vempala', 'Wolfgang Maass'], u'2016-11-11', u'We propose a model for binding of variables such as the thematic role of a\nword in a sentence or episode (e.g., agent or patient), to concrete fillers\n(e.g., a word or concept). Our model is based on recent experimental data about\ncorresponding processes in the human brain. One source of information are\nelectrode recordings from the human brain, which suggest that concepts are\nrepresented in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) through sparse sets of neurons\n(assemblies). Another source of information are fMRI recordings from the human\nbrain, which suggest that subregions of the temporal cortex are dedicated to\nthe representation of specific roles (e.g., subject or object) of concepts in a\nsentence or visually presented episode. We propose that quickly recruited\nassemblies of neurons in these subregions act as pointers to previously created\nassemblies that represent concepts. We provide a proof of principle that the\nresulting model for binding through assembly pointers can be implemented in\nnetworks of spiking neurons, and supports basic operations of brain\ncomputations, such as structured information retrieval and copying of\ninformation. We also show that salient features of fMRI data on neural activity\nduring structured information retrieval can be reproduced by the proposed\nmodel.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03698v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'The Neural Basis and Evolution of Divergent and Convergent Thought', ['Liane Gabora'], u'2016-11-11', u'This chapter takes as its departure point a neural level theory of insight\nthat arose from studies of the sparse, distributed, content-addressable\narchitecture of associative memory. It is argued that convergent thought is\nmost fruitfully characterized in terms of, not the generation of a single\ncorrect solution (as it is conventionally construed), but using concepts in\ntheir most compact form by activating neural cell assemblies that respond to\ntheir most typical properties. This allows them to be deployed in a\nconventional manner such that effort is reserved for exploring causal\nrelationships. Conversely, it is argued that divergent thought is most\nfruitfully characterized in terms of, not the generation of multiple solutions\n(as it is conventionally construed), but using concepts in a form that is,\nalbeit expanded, constrained by the situation, by activating neural cell\nassemblies that respond to context-specific atypical properties. This allows\nthem to be deployed in a manner that is conducive to exploring unconventional\nyet potentially relevant associations, and unearthing potentially useful\nrelationships of correlation. Thus, divergent thought can involve as few as one\nidea. This proposal is compatible with widespread beliefs that (1) most\ncreative tasks require not many solutions but one, yet entail both divergent\nand convergent thinking, and (2) not all problems with multiple solutions\nrequire creative thinking, and conversely, some problems with single solution\ndo require creative thought. The chapter discusses how the ability to shift\nbetween convergent and divergent modes of thought may have evolved, and it\nconcludes with educational and vocational implications.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03609v1', ['Neurons and Cognition', 'Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'A Possible Role for Entropy in Creative Cognition', ['Liane Gabora'], u'2016-11-11', u'This paper states the case for applying the conceptual and analytic tools\nassociated with the study of entropy in physical systems to cognition, focusing\non creative cognition. It is proposed that minds modify their contents and\nadapt to their environments to minimize psychological entropy:\narousal-provoking uncertainty, which can be experienced negatively as anxiety,\nor positively as a wellspring for creativity (or both). Thus, intrinsically\nmotivated creativity begins with detection of high psychological entropy\nmaterial (e.g., a question or inconsistency), which provokes uncertainty and is\narousal-inducing. This material is recursively considering from new contexts\nuntil it is sufficiently restructured that arousal dissipates and entropy\nreaches an acceptable level. Restructuring involves neural synchrony and\ndynamic binding, and may be facilitated by temporarily shifting to a more\nassociative mode of thought. The creative outcome may similarly induce\nrestructuring in others, and thereby contribute to the cultural evolution of\nmore nuanced understandings. Thus, the concept of entropy could play a unifying\nrole in cognitive science as a driver of thought and action, and in cultural\nstudies as the driver of the creative innovations that fuel cultural evolution.\nThe paper concludes with an invitation for cross-disciplinary exploration of\nthis potential new arena of entropy studies.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03605v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Configuration Interaction of Hydropathic Waves Enables Ubiquitin\n  Functionality', ['Douglas C. Allan', 'J. C. Phillips'], u'2016-11-11', u'Ubiquitin, discovered less than 50 years ago, tags thousands of diseased\nproteins for destruction. It is small (only 76 amino acids), and is found\nunchanged in mammals, birds, fish and even worms. Key features of its\nfunctionality are identified here using critical point thermodynamic scaling\ntheory. These include Fano interference between first- and second-order\nelements of globular surface shape transitions. Comparison with its closest\nrelative, 76 amino acid Nedd8, shows that the latter lacks these features. A\ncracked elastic network model is proposed for the common target shared by many\ndiseased proteins.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03818v1', ['Other'], []]

Methods: Mr. OS (Hong Kong)\nand Ms. OS (Hong Kong) represent the first large-scale cohort studies on bone\nhealth in elderly Chinese men and women. The current study compared Genant's SQ\nmethod and ABQ method in these two cohorts. Based on quantitative measurement,\nthe severity of ABQ method detected fractures was additionally classified into\ngrade-1, grad-2, and grade-3 according to SQ's deformity criteria. The\nradiographs of 1,954 elderly Chinese men (mean: 72.3 years) and 1,953 elderly\nChinese women (mean: 72.5 years) were evaluated. Results: according to ABQ,\ngrade-1,-2,-3 VFs accounted for 1.89%, 1.74%, 2.25% in men, and 3.33%, 3.07%,\nand 5.53% in women. In men and women, 15.7% (35/223) and 34.5% (48/139) of\nvertebrae with SQ grade-1 deformity were ABQ(+, with fracture) respectively. In\nmen and women, 89.7% (35/39) and 66.7% (48/72) of vertebrae with ABQ grade-1\nfracture had SQ grade-1 deformity. For grade-1 change, SQ (-, negative without\nfracture) & ABQ (+, positive with vertebral cortex line fracture) subjects tend\nto have a lower BMD than the SQ(+)& ABQ(-) subjects. In subjects with SQ\ngrade-2 deformity, those were also ABQ(+) tended to have a lower BMD than those\nwere ABQ(-). In all grades, SQ(-)&ABQ(-) subjects tended to have highest BMD,\nwhile SQ(+)&ABQ(+)subjects tended to have lowest BMD. Conclusion: ABQ method\nmay be more sensitive to VF associated mild lower BMD than SQ method.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03488v1', ['Tissues and Organs'], []]
