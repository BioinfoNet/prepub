[u'Predict or classify: The deceptive role of time-locking in brain signal\n  classification', ['Marco Rusconi', 'Angelo Valleriani'], u'2016-05-26', u'Several experimental studies claim to be able to predict the outcome of\nsimple decisions from brain signals measured before subjects are aware of their\ndecision. Often, these studies use multivariate pattern recognition methods\nwith the underlying assumption that the ability to classify the brain signal is\nequivalent to predict the decision itself. Here we show instead that it is\npossible to correctly classify a signal even if it does not contain any\npredictive information about the decision. We first define a simple stochastic\nmodel that mimics the random decision process between two equivalent\nalternatives, and generate a large number of independent trials that contain no\nchoice-predictive information. The trials are first time-locked to the time\npoint of the final event and then classified using standard machine-learning\ntechniques. The resulting classification accuracy is above chance level long\nbefore the time point of time-locking. We then analyze the same trials using\ninformation theory. We demonstrate that the high classification accuracy is a\nconsequence of time-locking and that its time behavior is simply related to the\nlarge relaxation time of the process. We conclude that when time-locking is a\ncrucial step in the analysis of neuronal activity patterns, both the emergence\nand the timing of the classification accuracy are affected by structural\nproperties of the network that generates the signal.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08228v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Deep Predictive Coding Networks for Video Prediction and Unsupervised\n  Learning', ['William Lotter', 'Gabriel Kreiman', 'David Cox'], u'2016-05-25', u'While great strides have been made in using deep learning algorithms to solve\nsupervised learning tasks, the problem of unsupervised learning - leveraging\nunlabeled examples to learn about the structure of a domain - remains a\ndifficult unsolved challenge. Here, we explore prediction of future frames in a\nvideo sequence as an unsupervised learning rule for learning about the\nstructure of the visual world. We describe a predictive neural network\n("PredNet") architecture that is inspired by the concept of "predictive coding"\nfrom the neuroscience literature. These networks learn to predict future frames\nin a video sequence, with each layer in the network making local predictions\nand only forwarding deviations from those predictions to subsequent network\nlayers. We show that these networks are able to robustly learn to predict the\nmovement of synthetic (rendered) objects, and that in doing so, the networks\nlearn internal representations that are useful for decoding latent object\nparameters (e.g. pose) that support object recognition with fewer training\nviews. We also show that these networks can scale to complex natural image\nstreams (car-mounted camera videos), capturing key aspects of both egocentric\nmovement and the movement of objects in the visual scene, and generalizing\nacross video datasets. These results suggest that prediction represents a\npowerful framework for unsupervised learning, allowing for implicit learning of\nobject and scene structure.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08104v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Nonnegative spline regression of incomplete tracing data reveals high\n  resolution neural connectivity', ['Kameron Decker Harris', 'Stefan Mihalas', 'Eric Shea-Brown'], u'2016-05-24', u'Whole-brain neural connectivity data are now available from viral tracing\nexperiments, which reveal the connections between a source injection site and\nelsewhere in the brain. These hold the promise of revealing spatial patterns of\nconnectivity throughout the mammalian brain. To achieve this goal, we seek to\nfit a weighted, nonnegative adjacency matrix among 100 {\\mu}m brain "voxels"\nusing viral tracer data. Despite a multi-year experimental effort, the problem\nremains severely underdetermined: Injection sites provide incomplete coverage,\nand the number of voxels is orders of magnitude larger than the number of\ninjections. Furthermore, projection data are missing within the injection site\nbecause local connections there are not separable from the injection signal.\n  We use a novel machine-learning algorithm to meet these challenges and\ndevelop a spatially explicit, voxel-scale connectivity map of the mouse visual\nsystem. Our method combines three features: a matrix completion loss for\nmissing data, a smoothing spline penalty term to regularize the problem, and\n(optionally) a low rank factorization. We demonstrate the consistency of our\nestimator using synthetic data and then apply it to newly available Allen Mouse\nBrain Connectivity Atlas data for the visual system. Our algorithm is\nsignificantly more predictive than current state of the art approaches which\nassume regions to be homogeneous. We demonstrate the efficacy of a low rank\nversion on visual cortex data and discuss the possibility of extending this to\na whole-brain connectivity matrix at the voxel scale.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08031v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Minimum relative entropy distributions with a large mean are Gaussian', ['Matteo Smerlak'], u'2016-05-26', u'We consider the following frustrated optimization problem: given a prior\nprobability distribution $q$, find the distribution $p$ minimizing the relative\nentropy with respect to $q$ such that $\\textrm{mean}(p)$ is fixed and large. We\nshow that solutions to this problem are asymptotically Gaussian. As an\napplication we derive an $H$-type theorem for evolutionary dynamics: the\nentropy of the (standardized) distribution of fitness of a population evolving\nunder natural selection is eventually increasing.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08259v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Measuring cellular traction forces on non-planar substrates', ['Jerome R. Soine', 'Nils Hersch', 'Georg Dreissen', 'Nico Hampe', 'Bernd Hoffmann', 'Rudolf Merkel', 'Ulrich S. Schwarz'], u'2016-05-26', u"Animal cells use traction forces to sense the mechanics and geometry of their\nenvironment. Measuring these traction forces requires a workflow combining cell\nexperiments, image processing and force reconstruction based on elasticity\ntheory. Such procedures have been established before mainly for planar\nsubstrates, in which case one can use the Green's function formalism. Here we\nintroduce a worksflow to measure traction forces of cardiac myofibroblasts on\nnon-planar elastic substrates. Soft elastic substrates with a wave-like\ntopology were micromolded from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and fluorescent\nmarker beads were distributed homogeneously in the substrate. Using feature\nvector based tracking of these marker beads, we first constructed a hexahedral\nmesh for the substrate. We then solved the direct elastic boundary volume\nproblem on this mesh using the finite element method (FEM). Using data\nsimulations, we show that the traction forces can be reconstructed from the\nsubstrate deformations by solving the corresponding inverse problem with a\nL1-norm for the residue and a L2-norm for 0th order Tikhonov regularization.\nApplying this procedure to the experimental data, we find that cardiac\nmyofibroblast cells tend to align both their shapes and their forces with the\nlong axis of the deformable wavy substrate.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08373v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Structure-based control of complex networks with nonlinear dynamics', ['Jorge G. T. Zanudo', 'Gang Yang', 'Reka Albert'], u'2016-05-26', u'Given the network of interactions underlying a complex system, what can we\nlearn about controlling such a system solely from its structure? Over a century\nof research in control theory has given us tools to answer this question, which\nwere widely applied in science and engineering. Yet the current tools do not\nalways consider the inherently nonlinear dynamics of real systems and the\nnaturally occurring system states in their definition of "control", a term\nwhose interpretation varies across disciplines. Here we use a new mathematical\nframework for structure-based control of networks governed by a broad class of\nnonlinear dynamics that includes the major dynamic models of biological,\ntechnological, and social processes. This framework provides realizable node\noverrides that steer a system towards any of its natural long term dynamic\nbehaviors and which are guaranteed to be effective regardless of the dynamic\ndetails and parameters of the underlying system. We use this framework on\nseveral real networks, compare its predictions to those of classical control\ntheory, and identify the topological characteristics that underlie the\ncommonalities and differences between these frameworks. Finally, we illustrate\nthe applicability of this new framework in the field of dynamic models by\ndemonstrating its success in two models of a gene regulatory network and\nidentifying the nodes whose override is necessary for control in the general\ncase, but not in specific model instances.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08415v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
[u'A resource-frugal probabilistic dictionary and applications in\n  (meta)genomics', ['Camille Marchet', 'Antoine Limasset', 'Lucie Bittner', 'Pierre Peterlongo'], u'2016-05-26', u'Genomic and metagenomic fields, generating huge sets of short genomic\nsequences, brought their own share of high performance problems. To extract\nrelevant pieces of information from the huge data sets generated by current\nsequencing techniques, one must rely on extremely scalable methods and\nsolutions. Indexing billions of objects is a task considered too expensive\nwhile being a fundamental need in this field. In this paper we propose a\nstraightforward indexing structure that scales to billions of element and we\npropose two direct applications in genomics and metagenomics.
