[u'Tomographic docking suggests the mechanism of auxin receptor TIR1\n  selectivity', ['Veselina V. Uzunova', 'Mussa Quareshy', 'Charo I. del Genio', 'Richard M. Napier'], u'2016-10-18', u'We study the binding of plant hormone IAA on its receptor TIR1 introducing a\nnovel computational method that we call tomographic docking and that accounts\nfor interactions occurring along the depth of the binding pocket. Our results\nsuggest that selectivity is related to constraints that potential ligands\nencounter on their way from the surface of the protein to their final position\nat the pocket bottom. Tomographic docking helps develop specific hypotheses\nabout ligand binding, distinguishing binders from non-binders, and suggests\nthat binding is a three-step mechanism, consisting of engagement with a niche\nin the back wall of the pocket, interaction with a molecular filter which\nallows or precludes further descent of ligands, and binding on the pocket base.\nOnly molecules that are able to descend the pocket and bind at its base allow\nthe co-receptor IAA7 to bind on the complex, thus behaving as active auxins.\nAnalyzing the interactions at different depths, our new method helps in\nidentifying critical residues that constitute preferred future study targets\nand in the quest for safe and effective herbicides. Also, it has the potential\nto extend the utility of docking from ligand searches to the study of processes\ncontributing to selectivity.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05715v1', ['Biomolecules', 'Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Propagation and synchronization of reverberatory bursts in developing\n  cultured networks', ['Chih-Hsu Huang', 'Yu-Ting Huang', 'Chun-Chung Chen', 'C. K. Chan'], u'2016-10-18', u'Developing networks of neural systems can exhibit spontaneous, synchronous\nactivities called neural bursts, which can be important in the organization of\nfunctional neural circuits. Before the network matures, the activity level of a\nburst can reverberate in repeated rise-and-falls in periods of hundreds of\nmilliseconds following an initial wave-like propagation of spiking activity,\nwhile the burst itself lasts for seconds. To investigate the spatiotemporal\nstructure of the reverberatory bursts, we culture dissociated, rat cortical\nneurons on a high-density multi-electrode array to record the dynamics of\nneural activity over the growth and maturation of the network. We find the\nsynchrony of the spiking significantly reduced following the initial wave and\nthe activities become broadly distributed spatially. The synchrony recovers as\nthe system reverberates until the end of the burst. Using a propagation model\nwe infer the spreading speed of the spiking activity, which increases as the\nculture ages. We perform computer simulations of the system using a\nphysiological model of spiking networks in two spatial dimensions and find the\nparameters that reproduce the observed resynchronization of spiking in the\nbursts. An analysis of the simulated dynamics suggests that the depletion of\nsynaptic resources causes the resynchronization. The spatial propagation\ndynamics of the simulations match well with observations over the course of a\nburst and point to an interplay of the synaptic efficacy and the noisy neural\nself-activation in producing the morphology of the bursts.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05717v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'The infochemical core', ['Antoni Hernandez-Fernandez', 'Ramon Ferrer-i-Cancho'], u'2016-10-18', u'Vocalizations and less often gestures have been the object of linguistic\nresearch over decades. However, the development of a general theory of\ncommunication with human language as a particular case requires a clear\nunderstanding of the organization of communication through other means.\nInfochemicals are chemical compounds that carry information and are employed by\nsmall organisms that cannot emit acoustic signals of optimal frequency to\nachieve successful communication. Here the distribution of infochemicals across\nspecies is investigated when they are ranked by their degree or the number of\nspecies with which it is associated (because they produce or they are sensitive\nto it). The quality of the fit of different functions to the dependency between\ndegree and rank is evaluated with a penalty for the number of parameters of the\nfunction. Surprisingly, a double Zipf (a Zipf distribution with two regimes\nwith a different exponent each) is the model yielding the best fit although it\nis the function with the largest number of parameters. This suggests that the\nworld wide repertoire of infochemicals contains a chemical nucleus shared by\nmany species and reminiscent of the core vocabularies found for human language\nin dictionaries or large corpora.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05654v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Active inference, eye movements and oculomotor delays', ['Laurent Perrinet', 'Rick Adams', 'Karl Friston'], u'2016-10-18', u'This paper considers the problem of sensorimotor delays in the optimal\ncontrol of (smooth) eye movements under uncertainty. Specifically, we consider\ndelays in the visuo-oculomotor loop and their implications for active\ninference. Active inference uses a generalisation of Kalman filtering to\nprovide Bayes optimal estimates of hidden states and action in generalized\ncoordinates of motion. Representing hidden states in generalized coordinates\nprovides a simple way of compensating for both sensory and oculomotor delays.\nThe efficacy of this scheme is illustrated using neuronal simulations of\npursuit initiation responses, with and without compensation. We then consider\nan extension of the gener-ative model to simulate smooth pursuit eye movements\n- in which the visuo-oculomotor system believes both the target and its centre\nof gaze are attracted to a (hidden) point moving in the visual field. Finally,\nthe generative model is equipped with a hierarchical structure, so that it can\nrecognise and remember unseen (occluded) trajectories and emit anticipatory\nresponses. These simulations speak to a straightforward and neurobiologically\nplausible solution to the generic problem of integrating information from\ndifferent sources with different temporal delays and the particular\ndifficulties encountered when a system - like the oculomotor system - tries to\ncontrol its environment with delayed signals.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05564v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], [u'INT']]
[u'Adaptive stimulus design for dynamic recurrent neural network models', ['R. Ozgur Doruk', 'Kechen Zhang'], u'2016-10-18', u'We present a theoretical application of an optimal experiment design (OED)\nmethodology to the development of mathematical models to describe the\nstimulus-response relationship of sensory neurons. Although there are a few\nrelated studies in the computational neuroscience literature on this topic,\nmost of them are either involving non-linear static maps or simple linear\nfilters cascaded to a static non-linearity. Although the linear filters might\nbe appropriate to demonstrate some aspects of neural processes, the high level\nof non-linearity in the nature of the stimulus-response data may render them\ninadequate. In addition, modelling by a static non-linear input - output map\nmay mask important dynamical (time-dependent) features in the response data.\nDue to all those facts a non-linear continuous time dynamic recurrent neural\nnetwork that models the excitatory and inhibitory membrane potential dynamics\nis preferred. The main goal of this research is to estimate the parametric\ndetails of this model from the available stimulus-response data. In order to\ndesign an efficient estimator an optimal experiment design scheme is proposed\nwhich computes a pre-shaped stimulus to maximize a certain measure of Fisher\nInformation Matrix. This measure depends on the estimated values of the\nparameters in the current step and the optimal stimuli are used in a maximum\nlikelihood estimation procedure to find an estimate of the network parameters.\nThis process works as a loop until a reasonable convergence occurs. The\nresponse data is discontinuous as it is composed of the neural spiking instants\nwhich is assumed to obey the Poisson statistical distribution. Thus the\nlikelihood functions depend on the Poisson statistics. In order to validate the\napproach and evaluate its performance, a comparison with another approach on\nestimation based on randomly generated stimuli is also presented.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05561v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

[u'Rapid adaptation of a polygenic trait after a sudden environmental shift', ['Kavita Jain', 'Wolfgang Stephan'], u'2016-10-18', u'Although a number of studies on natural and laboratory populations have shown\nthat a population initially well-adapted to its environment can evolve rapidly\nwhen conditions suddenly change, the dynamics of rapid adaptation are not well\nunderstood. Here a population genetic model of polygenic selection is analyzed\nto describe the short-term response of a quantitative trait after a sudden\nshift of the phenotypic optimum. When both the size of the effect and the\ninitial distance to the phenotypic optimum are small, the genomic signatures of\npolygenic selection are small to moderate allele frequency changes that occur\nin the short-term phase in a synergistic fashion. In contrast, selective\nsweeps, i.e., dramatic changes in the allele frequency may occur at major loci\nprovided the shift of the optimum is sufficiently large. Explicit analytical\nexpressions for the time scales over which the mean deviation in the phenotypic\ntrait becomes negligible are provided. Applications of our theoretical results\nto the relationship between QTL and selective sweep mapping and to tests of\nfast polygenic adaptation are discussed.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05478v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Towards a HPC-oriented parallel implementation of a learning algorithm\n  for bioinformatics applications', ["Gianni D'Angelo", 'Salvatore Rampone'], u'2016-10-18', u'Background: The huge quantity of data produced in Biomedical research needs\nsophisticated algorithmic methodologies for its storage, analysis, and\nprocessing. High Performance Computing (HPC) appears as a magic bullet in this\nchallenge. However, several hard to solve parallelization and load balancing\nproblems arise in this context. Here we discuss the HPC-oriented implementation\nof a general purpose learning algorithm, originally conceived for DNA analysis\nand recently extended to treat uncertainty on data (U BRAIN). The U-BRAIN\nalgorithm is a learning algorithm that finds a Boolean formula in disjunctive\nnormal form (DNF), of approximately minimum complexity, that is consistent with\na set of data (instances) which may have missing bits. The conjunctive terms of\nthe formula are computed in an iterative way by identifying, from the given\ndata, a family of sets of conditions that must be satisfied by all the positive\ninstances and violated by all the negative ones; such conditions allow the\ncomputation of a set of coefficients (relevances) for each attribute (literal),\nthat form a probability distribution, allowing the selection of the term\nliterals. The great versatility that characterizes it, makes U-BRAIN applicable\nin many of the fields in which there are data to be analyzed. However the\nmemory and the execution time required by the running are of O(n3) and of O(n5)\norder, respectively, and so, the algorithm is unaffordable for huge data sets.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05512v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]

Culturing epithelial monolayers on a substrate is an in vitro\nconfiguration suitable to quantitatively characterize such tissue migration by\nmeasuring cell velocity, density and cell-substrate interaction force.\nInhibiting cell division, we limit cell density increase and favor steady cell\nmigration, while by using long narrow strips we stabilise the migrating front\nshape, so that we observe migration over a day or more. In the monolayer bulk,\nthe cell velocity is a function of the cell density, namely it increases as a\nlinear function of the cell radius. At least ten periods of propagating\nvelocity waves are detected with a high signal-to-noise ratio, enabling for\ntheir quantitative spatio-temporal analysis. Cell density displays waves, in\nphase opposition with the velocity, as predicted by mass conservation;\nsimilarly, cell-substrate force appear to display small amplitude waves, in\nphase quadrature with respect to velocity, compatible with predictions for an\nelastic monolayer. The wave phase celerity is of order of ten micrometers per\nminute, i.e. ten times the monolayer migration velocity; wave celerity and\nfrequency too decrease with cell density. We propose an experiment-inspired\nbottom-up biochemical model of these waves, where motility forces in the bulk\nof the monolayer are oriented by a dynamic pulling on cell-cell junctions. We\nfind that parameters values close to the instability limit where waves appear\nyield predictions of wave characteristics close to experimentally observed\nvalues.
