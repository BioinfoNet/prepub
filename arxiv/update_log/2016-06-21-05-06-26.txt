[u'Modeling the distribution of distance data in Euclidean space', ['Ruth Davidson', 'Joseph Rusinko', 'Zoe Vernon', 'Jing Xi'], u'2016-06-20', u'Phylogenetic inference-the derivation of a hypothesis for the common\nevolutionary history of a group of species- is an active area of research at\nthe intersection of biology, computer science, mathematics, and statistics. One\nassumes the data contains a phylogenetic signal that will be recovered with\nvarying accuracy due to the quality of the method used, and the quality of the\ndata.\n  The input for distance-based inference methods is an element of a Euclidean\nspace with coordinates indexed by the pairs of organisms. For several\nalgorithms there exists a subdivision of this space into polyhedral cones such\nthat inputs in the same cone return the same tree topology. The geometry of\nthese cones has been used to analyze the inference algorithms. In this chapter,\nwe model how input data points drawn from DNA sequences are distributed\nthroughout Euclidean space in relation to the space of tree metrics, which in\nturn can also be described as a collection of polyhedral cones.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06146v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'A conditional likelihood is required to estimate the selection\n  coefficient in ancient DNA', ['Angelo Valleriani'], u'2016-06-20', u'Time-series of allele frequencies are a useful and unique set of data to\ndetermine the strength of natural selection on the background of genetic drift.\nTechnically, the selection coefficient is estimated by means of a likelihood\nfunction built under the hypothesis that the available trajectory spans a\nsufficiently large portion of the fitness landscape. Especially for ancient\nDNA, however, often only one single such trajectories is available and the\ncoverage of the fitness landscape is very limited. In fact, one single\ntrajectory is more representative of a process conditioned both in the initial\nand in the final condition than of a process free to end anywhere. Based on the\nMoran model of population genetics, here we show how to build a likelihood\nfunction for the selection coefficient that takes the statistical peculiarity\nof single trajectories into account. We show that this conditional likelihood\ndelivers a precise estimate of the selection coefficient also when allele\nfrequencies are close to fixation whereas the unconditioned likelihood fails.\nFinally, we discuss the fact that the traditional, unconditioned likelihood\nalways delivers an answer, which is often unfalsifiable and appears reasonable\nalso when it is wrong.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06090v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Lack of ecological context can create the illusion of social success in\n  Dictyostelium discoideum', ['Ricardo Martinez-Garcia', 'Corina E. Tarnita'], u'2016-06-19', u'Studies of cooperation in microbes often focus on one fitness component, with\nlittle information about or attention to the ecological context, and this can\nlead to paradoxical results. The life cycle of the social amoeba Dictyostelium\ndiscoideum includes a multicellular stage in which not necessarily clonal\namoebae aggregate upon starvation to form a possibly chimeric (genetically\nheterogeneous) fruiting body made of dead stalk and spores. The lab-measured\nreproductive skew in the spores of chimeras indicates strong social antagonism;\nthis should result in low genotypic diversity, which is inconsistent with\nobservations from nature. Two studies have suggested that this inconsistency\nstems from the one-dimensional assessment of fitness (spore production) and\nthat the solution lies in tradeoffs between multiple traits, e.g.: spore size\nversus viability; and staying vegetative versus becoming dormant. We\ntheoretically explore different tradeoff-implementing mechanisms and provide a\nunifying ecological framework in which the two tradeoffs above, as well as\nnovel ones, arise collectively in response to characteristics of the\nenvironment. We find that spore production comes at the expense of vegetative\ncell production, time to development, and, depending on the experimental setup,\nspore size and viability. Furthermore, we find that all existing experimental\nresults regarding chimeric mixes can be qualitatively recapitulated without\nneeding to invoke social interactions, which allows for simple resolutions to\npreviously paradoxical results. We conclude that the complexities of life\nhistories, including social behavior and multicellularity, can only be\nunderstood in the appropriate multidimensional ecological context.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05913v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Seasonality can induce coexistence of multiple bet-hedging strategies in\n  Dictyostelium discoideum via storage effect', ['Ricardo Martinez-Garcia'], u'2016-06-19', u'D. discoideum has been recently suggested as an example of bet-hedging. Upon\nstarvation a population of unicellular amoebae splits between aggregators,\nwhich form a fruiting body made of a stalk and resistant spores, and\nnon-aggregators. Spores are favored by long starvation periods, but vegetative\ncells can exploit resources in fast-recovering environments. This partition can\nbe understood as a bet-hedging strategy that evolves in response to stochastic\nstarvation times. A genotype is defined by a different balance between each\ntype of cells. In this framework, if the ecological conditions are defined in\nterms of the mean starvation time (i.e. time between onset of starvation and\nthe arrival of a new food pulse), a single genotype dominates each environment,\nwhich is inconsistent with the huge genetic diversity observed in nature. We\ninvestigate whether seasonality, represented by a periodic alternation in the\nmean starvation times, allows the coexistence of several strategies. We use a\nnon-spatial (well-mixed) setting where different strains compete for a pulse of\nresources. We find that seasonality, which we model via two seasons, induces a\ntemporal storage effect that can promote the stable coexistence of multiple\ngenotypes. Two conditions need to be met. First, the distributions of\nstarvation times in each season cannot overlap in order to create two well\ndifferentiated habitats within the year. Second, numerous growth-starvation\ncycles have to occur during each season to allow well-adapted strains to grow\nand survive the subsequent unfavorable period. Additional tradeoffs among\nlife-history traits can expand the range of coexistence and increase the number\nof coexisting strategies, contributing towards explaining the genetic diversity\nobserved in D. discoideum.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05912v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Coexistence of competing metabolic pathways in well-mixed populations', ['Lenin Fernandez', 'Andre Amado', 'Fernando Fagundes Ferreira', 'Paulo R. A. Campos'], u'2016-06-19', u'Understanding why strains with different metabolic pathways that compete for\na single limiting resource coexist is a challenging issue within a theoretical\nperspective. Previous investigations rely on mechanisms such as group or\nspatial structuring to achieve a stable coexistence between competing metabolic\nstrategies. Nevertheless, coexistence has been experimentally reported even in\nsituations where it cannot be attributed to spatial effects [Heredity {\\bf\n100}, 471 (2008)]. According to that study a toxin expelled by one of the\nstrains can be responsible for the stable maintenance of the two strain types.\nWe propose a resource-based model in which an efficient strain with a slow\nmetabolic rate competes with a second strain type which presents a fast but\ninefficient metabolism. Moreover, the model assumes that the inefficient strain\nproduces a toxin as a byproduct. This toxin affects the growth rate of both\nstrains with different strength. Through an extensive exploration of the\nparameter space we determine the situations at which the coexistence of the two\nstrains is possible. Interestingly, we observe that the resource influx rate\nplays a key role in the maintenance of the two strain types. In a scenario of\nresource scarcity the inefficient is favored, though as the resource influx\nrate is augmented the coexistence becomes possible and its domain is enlarged.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05901v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

Shakhnovich'], u'2016-06-18', u'Emergence of new protein structures has proved difficult to trace in nature\nand engineer in the laboratory. However, one aspect of structure evolution has\nproved immensely helpful for determining the three-dimensional structure of\nproteins from their sequences: in the vast majority of cases, proteins that\nshare more than 30% sequence identity have similar structures. Below this mark\nis the "twilight zone" where proteins may have identical or very different\nstructures. These observations form the foundational intuition behind structure\nhomology modeling. Despite their importance, however, they have never received\na comprehensive biophysical justification. Here we show that the onset of the\ntwilight zone is more gradual for proteins with low contact density, a proxy\nfor low thermodynamic stability, than proteins with high contact density. Then\nwe present an analytical model that treats divergent fold evolution as an\nactivated process, in analogy to chemical kinetics, where sequence evolution\nmust overcome thermodynamically unstable evolutionary intermediates to discover\nnew folds. This model explains the existence of a twilight zone and explains\nwhy its onset is more abrupt for some classes of proteins than for others. We\ntest the assumptions of the model and characterize the dynamics of fold\nevolution using evolutionary simulations of model proteins and cell\npopulations. Overall these results show how fundamental biophysical constraints\ndirected evolutionary dynamics leading to the Universe of modern protein\nstructures and sequences.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05802v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

Theoretical models of neural-cognitive relationships have been\ndeveloped based on observations of linear and non-linear increases in brain\nactivity. Neural efficiency and capacity are two parameters of current\ntheoretical models. These two theoretical parameters describe the rate of\nincrease of brain activity and the upper limits of the increases, respectively.\nThe current work demonstrates that a quadratic model of increasing brain\nactivity in response to the n-back task is a solution to a differential\nequation model. This reinterpretation of a standard approach to analyzing a\ncommon cognitive task provides a wealth of new insight. The results include\nbrain wide measures of neural efficiency and capacity. The quantification of\nneural-cognitive relationships provides evidence to support current cognitive\nneuroscience theories. In addition, the methods provide a framework for\nunderstanding the neural mechanisms of working memory. This allows estimation\nof the effects of experimental manipulations within a conceptual research\nframework.
