[u'Energetic frustrations in protein folding at residue resolution: a simulation study of homologous immunoglobulin-like \\b{eta}-sandwich proteins', ['Yunxiang Sun', 'Dengming Ming'], u'2017-01-27', u'Nonnative residual interactions have attracted increasing attention in recent protein folding researches. Experimental and theoretical investigations had been set out to catch nonnative contacts that might dominate key events in protein folding. However, energetic frustrations caused by nonnative inter-residue interactions are not systematically characterized, due to the complicated folding mechanism. Recently, we studied the folding of a set of homologous all-{\\alpha} proteins and found that nonnative-contact-based energetic frustrations are closely related to protein native-contact networks. In this paper, we studied the folding of nine homologous immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) \\b{eta}-sandwich proteins and examined energetic frustrations caused by nonnative inter-residue interactions, based on analyses of residual phi-values and contact maps of transition state ensembles. The proteins share similar tertiary structures, thus minimize topology frustration differences in protein folding and highlighting the effects of energetic frustrations as caused by hydrophilic-hydrophobic mutations. Our calculations showed that energetic frustrations have highly heterogeneous effects on the folding of most secondary structures and on the folding correlations between different folding-patches of \\b{eta}-sandwich proteins. The simulations revealed a strong interplay between energetic frustrations and native-contact networks in \\b{eta}-sandwich domains, which ensures that \\b{eta}-sandwich domains follow a common folding mechanism. Our results suggested that the folding processes of \\b{eta}-sandwich proteins might be redesigned by carefully manipulating energetic frustrations at residue level.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08094v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Sequence-based prediction of function site and protein-ligand interaction by a functionally annotated domain profile database', ['Dengming Ming', 'Min Han', 'Xiongbo An'], u'2017-01-27', u'Identifying protein functional sites (PFSs) and protein-ligand interactions (PLIs) are critically important in understanding the protein function and the involved biochemical reactions. As large amount of unknown proteins are quickly accumulated in this post-genome era, an urgent task arises to predict PFSs and PLIs at residual level. Nowadays many knowledge-based methods have been well developed for prediction of PFSs, however, accurate methods for PLI prediction are still lacking. In this study, we have presented a new method for prediction of PLIs and PFSs based on sequence of the inquiry protein. The key of the method hinges on a function- and interaction-annotated protein domain profile database, called fiDPD, which was built from the Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) database, using a hidden Markov model program. The method was applied to 13 target proteins from the recent Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP10/11). Our calculations gave a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) value of 0.66 for prediction of PFSs, and an 80% recall in prediction of PLIs. Our method reveals that PLIs are conserved during the evolution of proteins, and they can be reliably predicted from fiDPD. fiDPD can be used as a complement to existent bioinformatics tools for protein function annotation.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08086v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'A Radically New Theory of how the Brain Represents and Computes with Probabilities', ['Gerard Rinkus'], u'2017-01-26', u'It is widely acknowledged that the brain i) implements probabilistic reasoning, and ii) represents information via population/distributed coding. Previous population-based probabilistic (PPC) theories share some basic properties: 1) continuous neurons; 2) all neurons formally participate in every code; 3) decoding requires either graded synapses or rate coding; 4) generally assume rate-coded signaling; individual neurons are generally assumed to 5) have unimodal, e.g., bell-shaped, tuning functions (TFs) and 6) be fundamentally noisy; and 7) noise/correlation are generally viewed as degrading computation. In contrast, our theory assumes: 1) binary neurons; 2) only a small subset of neurons, i.e., a sparse distributed code (SDC), comprises any individual code; 3) binary synapses; 4) signaling via waves of contemporaneously arriving first-spikes; individual neurons 5) have completely flat TFs (all weights initially zero) and 6) are not noisy; and 7) noise is a resource used to preserve similarity from inputs to codes. Thus, noise controls a tradeoff between storage capacity and embedding the input space statistics (in the pattern of code intersections), indirectly yielding particular correlation patterns. The theory, Sparsey, was introduced 20 years ago as a canonical cortical circuit/algorithm model, but not elaborated as a probabilistic model. Assuming input similarity correlates with likelihood, the active SDC code simultaneously represents both the most probable hypothesis and the full probability distribution. We show this for spatial and spatiotemporal (sequential) cases. Finally, consistent with moving beyond the Neuron Doctrine to the view that the SDC (cell assembly, ensemble) is the atomic unit of neural representation, Sparsey explains how classical unimodal TFs emerge as an artifact of a single/few-trial learning process in which SDC codes are laid down in superposition.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07879v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

To do so, we classify structural connectome pairs from two large longitudinal datasets as either belonging to the same individual or not. Our data is comprised of 227 individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and 226 from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). We achieve 0.99 area under the ROC curve score for features which represent either weights or network structure of the connectomes (node degrees, PageRank and local efficiency).

[u'The Causal Frame Problem: An Algorithmic Perspective', ['Ardavan Salehi Nobandegani', 'Ioannis N. Psaromiligkos'], u'2017-01-26', u'The Frame Problem (FP) is a puzzle in philosophy of mind and epistemology, articulated by the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy as follows: "How do we account for our apparent ability to make decisions on the basis only of what is relevant to an ongoing situation without having explicitly to consider all that is not relevant?" In this work, we focus on the causal variant of the FP, the Causal Frame Problem (CFP). Assuming that a reasoner\'s mental causal model can be (implicitly) represented by a causal Bayes net, we first introduce a notion called Potential Level (PL). PL, in essence, encodes the relative position of a node with respect to its neighbors in a causal Bayes net. Drawing on the psychological literature on causal judgment, we substantiate the claim that PL may bear on how time is encoded in the mind. Using PL, we propose an inference framework, called the PL-based Inference Framework (PLIF), which permits a boundedly-rational approach to the CFP to be formally articulated at Marr\'s algorithmic level of analysis. We show that our proposed framework, PLIF, is consistent with a wide range of findings in causal judgment literature, and that PL and PLIF make a number of predictions, some of which are already supported by existing findings.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08100v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'A stage-structured Bayesian hierarchical model for salmon lice populations at individual salmon farms - Estimated from multiple farm data sets', ['Magne Aldrin', 'Ragnar Bang Huseby', 'Audun Stien', 'Randi Nygaard Grntvedt', 'Hildegunn Viljugrein', 'Peder Andreas Jansen'], u'2017-01-27', u'Salmon farming has become a prosperous international industry over the last decades. Along with growth in the production farmed salmon, however, an increasing threat by pathogens has emerged. Of special concern is the propagation and spread of the salmon louse, Lepeophtheirus salmonis. In order to gain insight into this parasites population dynamics in large scale salmon farming system, we present a fully mechanistic stage-structured population model for the salmon louse, also allowing for complexities involved in the hierarchical structure of full scale salmon farming. The model estimates parameters controlling a wide range of processes, including temperature dependent demographic rates, fish size and abundance effects on louse transmission rates, effects sizes of various salmon louse control measures, and distance based between farm transmission rates. Model parameters were estimated from data including 32 salmon farms, except the last production months for five farms which were used to evaluate model predictions. We used a Bayesian estimation approach, combining the prior distributions and the data likelihood into a joint posterior distribution for all model parameters. The model generated expected values that fitted the observed infection levels of the chalimus, adult female and other mobile stages of salmon lice, reasonably well. Predictions for the time periods not used for fitting the model were also consistent with the observational data. We argue that the present model for the population dynamics of the salmon louse in aquaculture farm systems may contribute to resolve the complexity of processes that drive that drive this host-parasite relationship, and hence may improve strategies to control the parasite in this production system.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08043v1', ['Populations and Evolution', 'Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Diversity and coevolutionary dynamics in high-dimensional phenotype spaces', ['Michael Doebeli', 'Iaroslav Ispolatov'], u'2017-01-26', u'We study macroevolutionary dynamics by extending microevolutionary competition models to long time scales. It has been shown that for a general class of competition models, gradual evolutionary change in continuous phenotypes (evolutionary dynamics) can be non-stationary and even chaotic when the dimension of the phenotype space in which the evolutionary dynamics unfold is high. It has also been shown that evolutionary diversification can occur along non-equilibrium trajectories in phenotype space. We combine these lines of thinking by studying long-term coevolutionary dynamics of emerging lineages in multi-dimensional phenotype spaces. We use a statistical approach to investigate the evolutionary dynamics of many different systems. We find: 1) for a given dimension of phenotype space, the coevolutionary dynamics tends to be fast and non-stationary for an intermediate number of coexisting lineages, but tends to stabilize as the evolving communities reach a saturation level of diversity; and 2) the amount of diversity at the saturation level increases rapidly (exponentially) with the dimension of phenotype space. These results have implications for theoretical perspectives on major macroevolutionary patterns such as adaptive radiation, long-term temporal patterns of phenotypic changes, and the evolution of diversity.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07861v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'The Biological Consequences of the Computational World: Mathematical Reflections on Cancer Biology', ['Giuseppe Longo'], u'2017-01-27', u'The role of continua has been clear since antiquity in the mathematical approaches to physics, while discrete manifolds were brought to the limelight mostly by Quantum and Information Theories, in the XX century. We first recall how theorizing and measuring radically change in physics when using discrete vs. continuous mathematical manifolds. It will follow that the reference to discrete structures and digital information is far from neutral in knowledge construction. In biology, in particular, the introduction of information as a new observable on discrete data types has been promoting a dramatic reorganization of the tools for knowledge. We briefly analyze the origin and the nature, then some consequences of the bias thus induced in life sciences, with particular emphasis on research on cancer. We finally summarize new theoretical frames that propose different directions as for the organizing principles for biological thinking and experimenting, including in cancer research. Cancer is now viewed as an organismal, tissue based issue, according to the perspective proposed in (Sonnenschein, Soto, 1999; Baker, 2015).', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08085v1', ['Tissues and Organs'], []]
[u'A continuum model of skeletal muscle tissue with loss of activation', ['Giulia Giantesio', 'Alessandro Musesti'], u'2017-01-26', u'We present a continuum model for the mechanical behavior of the skeletal muscle tissue when its functionality is reduced due to aging. The loss of ability of activating is typical of the geriatric syndrome called sarcopenia. The material is described by a hyperelastic, polyconvex, transverse isotropic strain energy function. The three material parameters appearing in the energy are fitted by least square optimization on experimental data, while incompressibility is assumed through a Lagrange multiplier representing the hydrostatic pressure. The activation of the muscle fibers, which is related to the contraction of the sarcomere, is modeled by the so called active strain approach. The loss of performance of an elder muscle is then obtained by lowering of some percentage the active part of the stress. The model is implemented numerically and the obtained results are discussed and graphically represented.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07823v1', ['Tissues and Organs'], []]
[u'Cell-to-cell variability and robustness in S-phase duration from genome replication kinetics', ['Qing Zhang', 'Federico Bassetti', 'Marco Gherardi', 'Marco Cosentino Lagomarsino'], u'2017-01-27', u'Genome replication, a key process for a cell, relies on stochastic initiation by replication origins, causing a variability of replication timing from cell to cell. While stochastic models of eukaryotic replication are widely available, the link between the key parameters and overall replication timing has not been addressed systematically.We use a combined analytical and computational approach to calculate how positions and strength of many origins lead to a given cell-to-cell variability of total duration of the replication of a large region, a chromosome or the entire genome.Specifically, the total replication timing can be framed as an extreme-value problem, since it is due to the last region that replicates in each cell. Our calculations identify two regimes based on the spread between characteristic completion times of all inter-origin regions of a genome. For widely different completion times, timing is set by the single specific region that is typically the last to replicate in all cells. Conversely, when the completion time of all regions are comparable,an extreme-value estimate shows that the cell-to-cell variability of genome replication timing has universal properties. Comparison with available data shows that the replication program of two yeast species falls in this extreme-value regime.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08038v1', ['Genomics'], []]

Estimating the frequency of genetic alterations is complicated by the high genomic instability that characterizes many tumor types.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07940v1', ['Genomics'], []]
