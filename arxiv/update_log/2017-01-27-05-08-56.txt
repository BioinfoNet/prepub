[u'A Forward Model at Purkinje Cell Synapses Facilitates Cerebellar Anticipatory Control', ['Ivan Herreros-Alonso', 'Xerxes D. Arsiwalla', 'Paul F. M. J. Verschure'], u'2017-01-26', u'How does our motor system solve the problem of anticipatory control in spite of a wide spectrum of response dynamics from different musculo-skeletal systems, transport delays as well as response latencies throughout the central nervous system? To a great extent, our highly-skilled motor responses are a result of a reactive feedback system, originating in the brain-stem and spinal cord, combined with a feed-forward anticipatory system, that is adaptively fine-tuned by sensory experience and originates in the cerebellum. Based on that interaction we design the counterfactual predictive control (CFPC) architecture, an anticipatory adaptive motor control scheme in which a feed-forward module, based on the cerebellum, steers an error feedback controller with counterfactual error signals. Those are signals that trigger reactions as actual errors would, but that do not code for any current or forthcoming errors. In order to determine the optimal learning strategy, we derive a novel learning rule for the feed-forward module that involves an eligibility trace and operates at the synaptic level. In particular, our eligibility trace provides a mechanism beyond co-incidence detection in that it convolves a history of prior synaptic inputs with error signals. In the context of cerebellar physiology, this solution implies that Purkinje cell synapses should generate eligibility traces using a forward model of the system being controlled. From an engineering perspective, CFPC provides a general-purpose anticipatory control architecture equipped with a learning rule that exploits the full dynamics of the closed-loop system.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07775v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Brain State Flexibility Accompanies Motor-Skill Acquisition', ['Pranav G. Reddy', 'Marcelo G. Mattar', 'Andrew C. Murphy', 'Nicholas F. Wymbs', 'Scott T. Grafton', 'Theodore D. Satterthwaite', 'Danielle S. Bassett'], u'2017-01-26', u'Learning requires the traversal of inherently distinct cognitive states to produce behavioral adaptation. Yet, tools to explicitly measure these states with non-invasive imaging -- and to assess their dynamics during learning -- remain limited. Here, we describe an approach based on a novel application of graph theory in which points in time are represented by network nodes, and similarities in brain states between two different time points are represented as network edges. We use a graph-based clustering technique to identify clusters of time points representing canonical brain states, and to assess the manner in which the brain moves from one state to another as learning progresses. We observe the presence of two primary states characterized by either high activation in sensorimotor cortex or high activation in a frontal-subcortical system. Flexible switching among these primary states and other less common states becomes more frequent as learning progresses, and is inversely correlated with individual differences in learning rate. These results are consistent with the notion that the development of automaticity is associated with a greater freedom to use cognitive resources for other processes. Taken together, our work offers new insights into the constrained, low dimensional nature of brain dynamics characteristic of early learning, which give way to less constrained, high-dimensional dynamics in later learning.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07646v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Multi-locus data distinguishes between population growth and multiple merger coalescents', ['Jere Koskela'], u'2017-01-26', u'We introduce a low dimensional function of the site frequency spectrum that is tailor-made for distinguishing coalescent models with multiple mergers from Kingman coalescent models with population growth, and use this function to construct a hypothesis test between these two model classes. The null and alternative sampling distributions of our statistic are intractable, but its low dimensionality renders these distributions amenable to Monte Carlo estimation. We construct kernel density estimates of the sampling distributions based on simulated data, and show that the resulting hypothesis test dramatically improves on the statistical power of a current state-of-the-art method. A key reason for this improvement is the use of multi-locus data, in particular averaging observed site frequency spectra across unlinked loci to reduce sampling variance. We also demonstrate the robustness of our method to nuisance and tuning parameters, and argue that it is readily generalisable for applications in hypothesis testing, parameter inference and experimental design.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07787v1', ['Populations and Evolution', 'Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'A negative answer to a conjecture arising in the study of selection-migration models in population genetics', ['Elisa Sovrano'], u'2017-01-26', u'We deal with the study of the evolution of the allelic frequencies, at a single locus, for a population distributed continuously over a bounded habitat. We consider evolution which occurs under the joint action of selection and arbitrary migration, that is independent of genotype, in absence of mutation and random drift. The focus is on a conjecture, that was raised up in literature of population genetics, about the possible uniqueness of polymorphic equilibria, which are known as clines, under particular circumstances. We study the number of these equilibria, making use of topological tools, and we give a negative answer to that question by means of two examples. Indeed, we provide numerical evidence of multiplicity of positive solutions for two different Neumann problems satisfying the requests of the conjecture.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07762v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'From event-labeled gene trees with horizontal gene transfer to species trees', ['Marc Hellmuth'], u'2017-01-26', u'Evolutionary event relations such as orthology, paralogy and xenology provide many information on the evolutionary history of the investigated genes. It has recently been shown that there is an event-labeled gene tree that displays estimated event relations if and only if the (graph-representation of these) relations are so-called cographs, resp., uniformly non-prime 2-structures. In particular, the respective event-labeled gene trees can then be constructed in polynomial time by utilizing solely the information of these event relations. In this contribution, we are concerned with the next conceptual step: the derivation of a species tree from an event-labeled gene tree $T$ that contains horizontal gene transfer, speciation and duplication events. We show that there is a species tree $S$ for $T$ if and only if certain triples that are displayed in $T$ are also displayed in $S$. To this end, a reconciliation map from $T$ to $S$ is provided that is consistent with so-called DTL-scenarios. Moreover, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm to decide whether there is a species tree for a given gene tree, and in the positive case, to construct the species tree and the respective reconciliation map.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07689v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'What Are People Tweeting about Zika? An Exploratory Study Concerning Symptoms, Treatment, Transmission, and Prevention', ['Michele Miller', 'Dr. Tanvi Banerjee', 'RoopTeja Muppalla', 'Dr. William Romine', 'Dr. Amit Sheth'], u'2017-01-17', u'The purpose of this study was to do a dataset distribution analysis, a classification performance analysis, and a topical analysis concerning what people are tweeting about four disease characteristics: symptoms, transmission, prevention, and treatment. A combination of natural language processing and machine learning techniques were used to determine what people are tweeting about Zika. Specifically, a two-stage classifier system was built to find relevant tweets on Zika, and then categorize these into the four disease categories. Tweets in each disease category were then examined using latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) to determine the five main tweet topics for each disease characteristic. Results 1,234,605 tweets were collected. Tweets by males and females were similar (28% and 23% respectively). The classifier performed well on the training and test data for relevancy (F=0.87 and 0.99 respectively) and disease characteristics (F=0.79 and 0.90 respectively). Five topics for each category were found and discussed with a focus on the symptoms category. Through this process, we demonstrate how misinformation can be discovered so that public health officials can respond to the tweets with misinformation.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07490v1', ['Other'], []]
[u'Contact Mechanics of a Small Icosahedral Virus', ['Cheng Zeng', 'Mercedes Hernando-Perez', 'Xiang Ma', 'Paul van der Schoot', 'Roya Zandi', 'Bogdan Dragnea'], u'2017-01-26', u'Virus binding to a surface results at least locally, at the contact area, in stress and potential structural perturbation of the virus cage. Here we address the question of the role of substrate-induced deformation in the overall virus mechanical response to the adsorption event. This question may be especially important for the broad category of viruses that have their shells stabilized by weak, non-covalent interactions. We utilize atomic force microscopy to measure the height change distributions of the brome mosaic virus upon adsorption from liquid on atomically flat substrates and present a continuum model which captures well the behavior. Height data fitting according the model provides, without recourse to indentation, estimates of virus elastic properties and of the interfacial energy.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07744v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'The role of T-helper/T-regulator lymphocyte ratio on the adaptive immune response: a mathematical model', ['Alessia Annibale'], u'2017-01-26', u'In this work we use a combination of statistical physics and dynamical systems approaches, to analyze the response to an antigen of a simplified model of the adaptive immune system, which comprises B, T helper and T regulatory lymphocytes. Results show that the model is remarkably robust against changes in the kinetic parameters, noise levels, and mechanisms that activate T regulatory lymphocytes. In contrast, the model is extremely sensitive to changes in the ratio between T helper and T regulatory lymphocytes, exhibiting in particular a phase transition, from a responsive to an immuno-suppressed phase, when the ratio is lowered below a critical value. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first mathematical study to support the validity of the T-helper/T-regulator lymphocyte ratio as an index of immunosuppression, with a potential for prognostic monitoring.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07712v1', ['Cell Behavior'], []]
