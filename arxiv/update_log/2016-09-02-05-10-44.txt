[u'Properties of low-dimensional collective variables in the molecular\n  dynamics of biopolymers', ['R. Meloni', 'C. Camilloni', 'G. Tiana'], u'2016-09-01', u'The description of the dynamics of a complex, high-dimensional system in\nterms of a low-dimensional set of collective variables Y can be fruitful if the\nlow dimensional representation satisfies a Langevin equation with drift and\ndiffusion coefficients which depend only on Y. We present a computational\nscheme to evaluate whether a given collective variable provides a faithful\nlow-dimensional representation of the dynamics of a high-dimensional system.\nThe scheme is based on the framework of finite-difference Langevin-equation,\nsimilar to that used for molecular-dynamics simulations. This allows one to\ncalculate the drift and diffusion coefficients in any point of the\nfull-dimensional system. The width of the distribution of drift and diffusion\ncoefficients in an ensemble of microscopic points at the same value of Y\nindicates to which extent the dynamics of Y is described by a simple Langevin\nequation. Using a simple protein model we show that collective variables often\nused to describe biopolymers display a non-negligible width both in the drift\nand in the diffusion coefficients. We also show that the associated effective\nforce is compatible with the equilibrium free--energy calculated from a\nmicroscopic sampling, but results in markedly different dynamical properties.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00157v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]

However, identification of differentially expressed\nconnectivity subnetworks in patients through the massive data collected using\nmodern imaging methods remain challenging on theory, computation, and\nstatistical inferences. We define an abnormal connectome subnetwork as a\nnetwork-object that includes three classes: nodes, differentially expressed\nedges, and an organized graph topology. We propose novel statistical methods to\ndetect and test the hidden and disease-related connectivity patterns as\nnetwork-objects. The network-object statistical approach is robust in both\nsimulations and actual data, and found to be replicable. Comparing to the\nconventional statistical methods, the proposed approach yields results with\nsimultaneously reduced false positive and negative discovery rates by letting\nedges borrow strength precisely with the guidance of graph topological\ninformation, which effectively improves the reproducibility of findings across\nbrain connectome studies. The network-object analyses may provide insights how\nbrain connectome is systematically impaired by brain illnesses.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00360v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

Here we present a draft monoamine connectome, along with a partial\nneuropeptide connectome, for the nematode C. elegans, based on new and\npublished expression data for biosynthetic genes and receptors. Thus, the\nneuronal connectome can be represented as a multiplex network, with synaptic,\ngap junction, and neuromodulatory layers representing alternative modes of\ninterneuronal interaction and with distinct network structures. In particular,\nthe monoamine network exhibits novel topological properties, with a highly\ndisassortative star-like structure and a rich-club of interconnected\nbroadcasting hubs. Despite the low degree of overlap between layers, we find\nhighly significant modes of interaction, pinpointing network locations and\nmultilink motifs where aminergic and neuropeptide signalling modulate synaptic\nactivity.

Our proposition is based on the recently developed\napproximation-free supersymmetric theory of stochastics that revealed the field\ntheoretic essence of the ubiquitous dynamical long-range order (turbulence, 1/f\nnoise, chaos, butterfly effect, self-organization, etc.) and predicted that the\ngeneral phase diagram of (weak-noise) stochastic dynamics consists of the three\nmajor phases: thermal equilibrium (T-phase), noise-induced chaos (N-phase, also\nknown as self-organized criticality), and ordinary chaos (C-phase). Within this\ntheoretical picture and using some common sense reasoning, we argue that the\nT-, N-, and C- phases should be classified, from the neuroscientific point of\nview, as the coma-, conscious-, and seizure-like phases, respectively. We\nsubstantiate this point of view by constructing the rudimentary T-N-C phase\ndiagram of the emulated S-ND on a neuromorphic electronic chip.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00001v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

To help reduce their impact,\nmathematical models of disease transmission have been studied to help\nunderstand disease dynamics and inform prevention strategies. Vaccination - one\nof the most important preventive measures of modern times - is of great\ninterest both theoretically and empirically. And in contrast to traditional\napproaches, recent research increasingly explores the pivotal implications of\nindividual behavior and heterogeneous contact patterns in populations. Our\nreport reviews the developmental arc of theoretical epidemiology with emphasis\non vaccination, as it led from classical models assuming homogeneously mixing\n(mean-field) populations and ignoring human behavior, to recent models that\naccount for behavioral feedback and/or population spatial/social structure.\nMany of the methods used originated in statistical physics, such as lattice and\nnetwork models, and their associated analytical frameworks. Similarly, the\nfeedback loop between vaccinating behavior and disease propagation forms a\ncoupled nonlinear system with analogs in physics. We also review the new\nparadigm of digital epidemiology, wherein sources of digital data such as\nonline social media are mined for high-resolution information on\nepidemiologically relevant individual behavior. Armed with the tools and\nconcepts of statistical physics, and further assisted by new sources of digital\ndata, models that capture nonlinear interactions between behavior and disease\ndynamics offer a novel way of modeling real-world phenomena, and can help\nimprove health outcomes.

[u'The dynamics of starvation and recovery', ['Justin D. Yeakel', 'Christopher P. Kempes', 'Sidney Redner'], u'2016-08-31', u"The eco-evolutionary dynamics of species is fundamentally linked to the\nenergetic constraints of its constituent individuals. Of particular importance\nare the tradeoffs between reproduction and the dynamics of starvation and\nrecovery in resource-limited environments. To elucidate the consequences of\nthis tradeoff, we introduce a minimal nutritional state-structured model that\nincorporates two classes of consumer: nutritionally replete consumers that\nreproduce, and undernourished, non-reproducing consumers that are susceptible\nto mortality. As a function of the transition rates between these replete and\nundernourished states that are determined by the presence or absence of\nresources, the consumer populations can either undergo cyclic dynamics or reach\na steady state. We obtain strong constraints on starvation and recovery rates\nby deriving allometric scaling relationships and find that population dynamics\nsubject to these constraints can approach the cyclic regime but are typically\ndriven to a steady state. Moreover, we find that these rates fall within a\n`refuge' in parameter space, where the probability of extinction of the\nconsumer population is minimized. Thus we identify a potential mechanism that\nmay both drive and constrain the dynamics of animal populations. Our model\nprovides a natural framework that predicts maximum body size for mammals by\ndetermining the relative stability of an otherwise homogeneous population to a\nmutant population with altered percent body fat. For body masses $\\lesssim\n10^7$g, individuals with increased energetic reserves can invade resident\npopulations, and vice versa for body mass $\\gtrsim 10^7$g, thus providing a\nprincipled mechanism for a within-lineage driver of Cope's rule.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08995v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

Such predictions agree with numerical simulations, but hitherto\nhave not been tested experimentally.
