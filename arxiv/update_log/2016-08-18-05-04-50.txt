[u'A Three Spatial Dimension Wave Latent Force Model for Describing\n  Excitation Sources and Electric Potentials Produced by Deep Brain Stimulation', ['Pablo A. Alvarado', 'Mauricio A. Alvarez', 'Alvaro A. Orozco'], u'2016-08-17', u"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a surgical treatment for Parkinson's Disease.\nStatic models based on quasi-static approximation are common approaches for DBS\nmodeling. While this simplification has been validated for bioelectric sources,\nits application to rapid stimulation pulses, which contain more high-frequency\npower, may not be appropriate, as DBS therapeutic results depend on stimulus\nparameters such as frequency and pulse width, which are related to time\nvariations of the electric field. We propose an alternative hybrid approach\nbased on probabilistic models and differential equations, by using Gaussian\nprocesses and wave equation. Our model avoids quasi-static approximation,\nmoreover, it is able to describe dynamic behavior of DBS. Therefore, the\nproposed model may be used to obtain a more realistic phenomenon description.\nThe proposed model can also solve inverse problems, i.e. to recover the\ncorresponding source of excitation, given electric potential distribution. The\nelectric potential produced by a time-varying source was predicted using\nproposed model. For static sources, the electric potential produced by\ndifferent electrode configurations were modeled. Four different sources of\nexcitation were recovered by solving the inverse problem. We compare our\noutcomes with the electric potential obtained by solving Poisson's equation\nusing the Finite Element Method (FEM). Our approach is able to take into\naccount time variations of the source and the produced field. Also, inverse\nproblem can be addressed using the proposed model. The electric potential\ncalculated with the proposed model is close to the potential obtained by\nsolving Poisson's equation using FEM.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04972v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Identification of interictal epileptic networks from dense-EEG', ['Mahmoud Hassan', 'Isabelle Merlet', 'Ahmad Mheich', 'Aya Kabbara', 'Arnaud Biraben', 'Anca Nica', 'Fabrice Wendling'], u'2016-08-17', u'Epilepsy is a network disease. The epileptic network usually involves\nspatially distributed brain regions. In this context, noninvasive M/EEG source\nconnectivity is an emerging technique to identify functional brain networks at\ncortical level from noninvasive recordings. In this paper, we analyze the\neffect of the two key factors involved in EEG source connectivity processing:\ni) the algorithm used in the solution of the EEG inverse problem and ii) the\nmethod used in the estimation of the functional connectivity. We evaluate four\ninverse solutions algorithms and four connectivity measures on data simulated\nfrom a combined biophysical/physiological model to generate realistic\ninterictal epileptic spikes reflected in scalp EEG. We use a new network-based\nsimilarity index (SI) to compare between the network identified by each of the\ninverse/connectivity combination and the original network generated in the\nmodel. The method will be also applied on real data recorded from one epileptic\npatient who underwent a full presurgical evaluation for drug-resistant focal\nepilepsy. In simulated data, results revealed that the selection of the\ninverse/connectivity combination has a significant impact on the identified\nnetworks. Results suggested that nonlinear methods for measuring the\nconnectivity are more efficient than the linear one. The wMNE inverse solution\nshowed higher performance than dSPM, cMEM and sLORETA. In real data, the\ncombination (wMNE/PLV) led to a very good matching between the interictal\nepileptic network identified from noninvasive EEG recordings and the network\nobtained from connectivity analysis of intracerebral EEG recordings. These\nresults suggest that source connectivity method, when appropriately configured,\nis able to extract highly relevant diagnostic information about networks\ninvolved in interictal epileptic spikes from non-invasive dense-EEG data.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04935v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Swarm equilibria in domains with boundaries', ['Razvan C. Fetecau', 'Mitchell Kovacic'], u'2016-08-17', u'We study equilibria in domains with boundaries for a first-order aggregation\nmodel that includes social interactions and exogenous forces. Such equilibrium\nsolutions can be connected or disconnected, the latter consisting in a delta\nconcentration on the boundary and a free swarm component in the interior of the\ndomain. Equilibria are stationary points of an energy functional, and stable\nconfigurations are local minimizers of this functional. We find a one-parameter\nfamily of disconnected equilibrium configurations which are not energy\nminimizers; the only stable equilibria are the connected states. Nevertheless,\nwe demonstrate that in certain cases the dynamical evolution, along the\ngradient flow of the energy functional, tends to overwhelmingly favour the\nformation of (unstable) disconnected equilibria.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05068v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Sustainable theory of a logistic model - Fisher Information approach', ['Avan Al-Saffar', 'Eun-jin Kim'], u'2016-08-17', u'Information theory provides a useful tool to understand the evolution of\ncomplex nonlinear systems and their sustainability. In particular, Fisher\nInformation (FI) has been evoked as a useful measure of sustainability and the\nvariability of dynamical systems including self-organising systems. By\nutilising FI, we investigate the sustainability of the logistic model for\ndifferent perturbations in the positive and/or negative feedback. Specifically,\nwe consider different oscillatory modulations in the parameters for positive\nand negative feedbacks and investigate their effect on the evolution of the\nsystem and Probability Density Functions (PDFs). Depending on the relative time\nscale of the perturbation to the response time of the system (the linear growth\nrate), we demonstrate the maintenance of the initial condition for a long time,\nmanifested by a broad bimodal PDF. We present the analysis of FI in different\ncases and elucidate its implications for the sustainability of population\ndynamics. We also show that a purely oscillatory growth rate can lead to a\nfinite amplitude solution while self-organisation of these systems can break\ndown with an exponentially growing solution due to the fluctuation in negative\nfeedback.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04987v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Mathematical model for pest-insect control using mating disruption and\n  trapping', ['Roumen Anguelov', 'Claire Dufourd', 'Yves Dumont'], u'2016-08-17', u'Controlling pest insects is a challenge of main importance to preserve crop\nproduction. In the context of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) programs, we\ndevelop a generic model to study the impact of mating disruption control using\nan artificial female pheromone to confuse males and adversely affect their\nmating opportunities. Consequently the reproduction rate is diminished leading\nto a decline in the population size. For more efficient control, trapping is\nused to capture the males attracted to the artificial pheromone. The model,\nderived from biological and ecological assumptions, is governed by a system of\nODEs. A theoretical analysis of the model without control is first carried out\nto establish the properties of the endemic equilibrium. Then, control is added\nand the theoretical analysis of the model enables to identify threshold values\nof pheromone which are practically interesting for field applications. In\nparticular, we show that there is a threshold above which the global asymptotic\nstability of the trivial equilibrium is ensured, i.e. the population goes to\nextinction. Finally we illustrate the theoretical results via numerical\nexperiments.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04880v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Developing a statistically powerful measure for phylogenetic tree\n  inference using phylogenetic identities and Markov invariants', ['Jeremy G Sumner', 'Amelia Taylor', 'Barbara R Holland', 'Peter D Jarvis'], u'2016-08-16', u'Recently there has been renewed interest in phylogenetic inference methods\nbased on phylogenetic invariants, alongside the related Markov invariants.\nBroadly speaking, both these approaches give rise to polynomial functions of\nsequence site patterns that, in expectation value, either vanish for particular\nevolutionary trees (in the case of phylogenetic invariants) or have well\nunderstood transformation properties (in the case of Markov invariants). While\nboth approaches have been valued for their intrinsic mathematical interest, it\nis not clear how they relate to each other, and to what extent they can be used\nas practical tools for inference of phylogenetic trees.\n  In this paper, by focusing on the special case of binary sequence data and\nquartets of taxa, we are able to view these two different polynomial-based\napproaches within a common framework. To motivate the discussion, we present\nthree desirable statistical properties that we argue any phylogenetic method\nshould satisfy: (1) sensible behaviour under reordering of input sequences; (2)\nstability as the taxa evolve independently according to a Markov process; and\n(3) ability to detect if the conditions of a continuous-time process are\nviolated. Motivated by these statistical properties, we develop and explore\nseveral new phylogenetic inference methods. In particular, we develop a\nstatistical bias-corrected version of the Markov invariants approach which\nsatisfies all three properties. We also extend previous work by showing that\nthe phylogenetic invariants can be implemented in such a way as to satisfy\nproperty (3). A simulation study shows that, in comparison to other methods,\nour new proposed approach based on bias-corrected Markov invariants is\nextremely powerful for phylogenetic inference.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04761v1', ['Populations and Evolution', 'Quantitative Methods'], []]

[u'Boosting Docking-based Virtual Screening with Deep Learning', ['Janaina Cruz Pereira', 'Ernesto Raul Caffarena', 'Cicero dos Santos'], u'2016-08-17', u'In this work, we propose a deep learning approach to improve docking-based\nvirtual screening. The introduced deep neural network, DeepVS, uses the output\nof a docking program and learns how to extract relevant features from basic\ndata such as atom and amino acid types obtained from protein-ligand complexes.\nOur approach introduces the use of atom and amino acid embeddings and\nimplements an effective way of creating distributed vector representations of\nprotein-ligand complexes by modeling the compound as a set of atom contexts\nthat is further processed by a convolutional layer. One of the main advantages\nof the proposed method is that it does not require feature engineering. We\nevaluate DeepVS on the Directory of Useful Decoys (DUD), using the output of\ntwo docking programs: AutodockVina1.1.2 and Dock6.6. Using a strict evaluation\nwith leave-one-out cross-validation, DeepVS outperforms the docking programs in\nboth AUC ROC and enrichment factor. Moreover, using the output of\nAutodockVina1.1.2, DeepVS achieves an AUC ROC of 0.80, which, to the best of\nour knowledge, is the best AUC reported so far for virtual screening using the\n40 receptors from DUD.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04844v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Noise and Function', ['Steven Weinstein', 'Theodore P. Pavlic'], u'2016-08-17', u'Noise is widely understood to be something that interferes with a signal or\nprocess. Thus, it is generally thought to be destructive, obscuring signals and\ninterfering with function. However, early in the 20th century, mechanical\nengineers found that mechanisms inducing additional vibration in mechanical\nsystems could prevent sticking and hysteresis. This so-called "dither" noise\nwas later introduced in an entirely different context at the advent of digital\ninformation transmission and recording in the early 1960s. Ironically, the\naddition of noise allows one to preserve information that would otherwise be\nlost when the signal or image is digitized. As we shall see, the benefits of\nadded noise in these contexts are closely related to the phenomenon which has\ncome to be known as stochastic resonance, the original version of which\nappealed to noise to explain how small periodic fluctuations in the\neccentricity of the earth\'s orbit might be amplified in such a way as to bring\nabout the observed periodic transitions in climate from ice age to temperate\nage and back. These noise-induced transitions have since been invoked to\nexplain a wide array of biological phenomena, including the foraging and\ntracking behavior of ants. Many biological phenomena, from foraging to gene\nexpression, are noisy, involving an element of randomness. In this paper, we\nillustrate the general principles behind dithering and stochastic resonance\nusing examples from image processing, and then show how the constructive use of\nnoise can carry over to systems found in nature.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04824v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
