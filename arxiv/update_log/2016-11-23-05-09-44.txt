[u'Derivation of human chromatic discrimination ability from an\n  information-theoretical notion of distance in color space', ['Maria da Fonseca', 'Ines Samengo'], u'2016-11-22', u'The accuracy with which humans can detect small chromatic differences varies\nthroughout color space. For example, we are far more precise when\ndiscriminating two similar orange stimuli than two similar green stimuli. In\norder for two colors to be perceived as different, the neurons representing\nchromatic information must respond differently, and the difference must be\nlarger than the trial-to-trial variability of the response to each separate\ncolor. Photoreceptors constitute the first stage in the processing of color\ninformation; many more stages are required before humans can consciously report\nwhether two stimuli are perceived as chromatically distinguishable or not.\nTherefore, although photoreceptor absorption curves are expected to influence\nthe accuracy of conscious discriminability, there is no reason to believe that\nthey should suffice to explain it. Here we develop information-theoretical\ntools based on the Fisher metric that demonstrate that photoreceptor absorption\nproperties explain ~87% of the variance of human color discrimination ability,\nas tested by previous behavioral experiments. In the context of this theory,\nthe bottleneck in chromatic information processing is determined by\nphotoreceptor absorption characteristics. Subsequent encoding stages modify\nonly marginally the chromatic discriminability at the photoreceptor level.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07272v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Object detection can be improved using human-derived contextual\n  expectations', ['Harish Katti', 'Marius V. Peelen', 'S. P. Arun'], u'2016-11-22', u'Each object in the world occurs in a specific context: cars are seen on\nhighways but not in forests. Contextual information is generally thought to\nfacilitate computation by constraining locations to search. But can knowing\ncontext yield tangible benefits in object detection? For it to do so, scene\ncontext needs to be learned independently from target features. However this is\nimpossible in traditional object detection where classifiers are trained on\nimages containing both target features and surrounding coarse scene features.\nIn contrast, we humans have the opportunity to learn context and target\nfeatures separately, such as when we see highways without cars. Here we show\nfor the first time that human-derived scene expectations can be used to improve\nobject detection performance in machines. To measure these expectations, we\nasked human subjects to indicate the scale, location and likelihood at which\ntargets may occur on scenes containing no targets. Humans showed highly\nsystematic expectations that we could accurately predict using scene features.\nWe then augmented state-of-the-art object detectors (based on deep neural\nnetworks) with these human-derived expectations on novel scenes to produce a\nsignificant (1-3%) improvement in detecting cars and people in scenes. This\nimprovement was due to low-confidence detector matches being correctly\nrelabeled as targets when they occurred in likely scenes.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07218v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Potential landscape of high dimensional nonlinear stochastic dynamics\n  and rare transitions with large noise', ['Ying Tang', 'Ruoshi Yuan', 'Gaowei Wang', 'Xiaomei Zhu', 'Ping Ao'], u'2016-11-22', u'Quantifying stochastic processes is essential to understand many natural\nphenomena, particularly in biology, including cell-fate decision in\ndevelopmental processes as well as genesis and progression of cancers. While\nvarious attempts have been made to construct potential landscape in high\ndimensional systems and to estimate rare transitions, they are practically\nlimited to cases where either noise is small or detailed balance condition\nholds. A general and practical approach to investigate nonequilibrium systems\ntypically subject to finite or large multiplicative noise and breakdown of\ndetailed balance remains elusive. Here, we formulate a computational framework\nto address this important problem. The current approach is based on a least\n"action" principle to efficiently calculate potential landscapes of systems\nunder arbitrary noise strength and without detailed balance. With the\ndeterministic stability structure preserving A-type stochastic integration, the\npotential barrier between different (local) stable stables is directly\ncomputable. The prevailing methods such as those based on WKB or\nFreidlin-Wentzell quasi-potential theory can be classified into the case of the\npresent framework under small noise limit. We demonstrate our approach in a\nnumerically accurate manner through explicitly solvable examples. We further\napply the method to investigate the role of noise on tumor heterogeneity in a\n38 dimensional network model for prostate cancer, and provide a new strategy on\ncontrolling cell populations by manipulating noise strength.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07140v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Leaf growth is conformal', ['Karen Alim', 'Shahaf Armon', 'Boris I. Shraiman', 'Arezki Boudaoud'], u'2016-11-21', u'Growth pattern dynamics lie at the heart of morphogenesis. Here, we\ninvestigate the growth of plant leaves. We compute the conformal transformation\nthat maps the contour of a leaf at a given stage onto the contour of the same\nleaf at a later stage. Based on the mapping we predict the local displacement\nfield in the leaf blade and find it to agree with the experimentally measured\ndisplacement field to 92%. This approach is applicable to any two-dimensional\nsystem with locally isotropic growth, enabling the deduction of the whole\ngrowth field just from observation of the tissue contour.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07032v1', ['Tissues and Organs'], []]
