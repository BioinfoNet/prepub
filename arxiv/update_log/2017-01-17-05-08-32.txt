[u'Packing in Protein Cores', ['Jennifer C. Gaines', 'Abram H. Clark', 'Lynne Regan', "Corey S. O'Hern"], u'2017-01-16', u'Proteins are biological polymers that underlie all cellular functions. The first high-resolution protein structures were determined by x-ray crystallography in the 1960s. Since then, there has been continued interest in understanding and predicting protein structure and stability. It is well-established that a large contribution to protein stability originates from the sequestration from solvent of hydrophobic residues in the protein core. How are such hydrophobic residues arranged in the core? And how can one best model the packing of these residues? Here we show that to properly model the packing of residues in protein cores it is essential that amino acids are represented by appropriately calibrated atom sizes, and that hydrogen atoms are explicitly included. We show that protein cores possess a packing fraction of $\\phi \\approx 0.56$, which is significantly less than the typically quoted value of 0.74 obtained using the extended atom representation. We also compare the results for the packing of amino acids in protein cores to results obtained for jammed packings from disrete element simulations composed of spheres, elongated particles, and particles with bumpy surfaces. We show that amino acids in protein cores pack as densely as disordered jammed packings of particles with similar values for the aspect ratio and bumpiness as found for amino acids. Knowing the structural properties of protein cores is of both fundamental and practical importance. Practically, it enables the assessment of changes in the structure and stability of proteins arising from amino acid mutations (such as those identified as a result of the massive human genome sequencing efforts) and the design of new folded, stable proteins and protein-protein interactions with tunable specificity and affinity.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04384v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Subsampling scaling: a theory about inference from partly observed systems', ['Anna Levina', 'Viola Priesemann'], u'2017-01-16', u"In real-world applications, observations are often constrained to a small fraction of a system. Such spatial subsampling can be caused by the inaccessibility or the sheer size of the system, and cannot be overcome by longer sampling. Spatial subsampling can strongly bias inferences about a system's aggregated properties. To overcome the bias, we derive analytically a subsampling scaling framework that is applicable to different observables, including distributions of neuronal avalanches, of number of people infected during an epidemic outbreak, and of node degrees. We demonstrate how to infer the correct distributions of the underlying full system, how to apply it to distinguish critical from subcritical systems, and how to disentangle subsampling and finite size effects. Lastly, we apply subsampling scaling to neuronal avalanche models and to recordings from developing neural networks. We show that only mature, but not young networks follow power-law scaling, indicating self-organization to criticality during development.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04277v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Evolution of risk attitudes in the population', ['Erdem Pulcu'], u'2017-01-16', u'We are living in an uncertain and dynamically changing world. Under uncertainty, perception of risk is an important factor for value-based decision-making and it is directly linked to the survival of species. However, how evolutionary selection pressures might have shaped risk attitudes in the population received almost no attention. Here, we demonstrate that fitness associated with different risk attitudes are influenced by value properties of the environment; as well as the characteristics and the density of competitors in the population. Although the risk neutrality is regarded as the optimal policy, in rapidly changing environments it cannot recover from a marked population density disadvantage. We show that risk-seeking strategies have better fitness when there is: large number of competing strategies in the population, and when the expected value difference between available options are relatively small. In tandem, the present results may be important for understanding peoples decision-making strategies volatile financial markets in terms of an environmental adaptation.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04346v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Origin of life in a digital microcosm', ['Nitash C G', 'Thomas LaBar', 'Arend Hintze', 'Christoph Adami'], u'2017-01-15', u'While all organisms on Earth descend from a common ancestor, there is no consensus on whether the origin of this ancestral self-replicator was a one-off event or whether it was only the final survivor of multiple origins. Here we use the digital evolution system Avida to study the origin of self-replicating computer programs. By using a computational system, we avoid many of the uncertainties inherent in any biochemical system of self-replicators (while running the risk of ignoring a fundamental aspect of biochemistry). We generated the exhaustive set of minimal-genome self-replicators and analyzed the network structure of this fitness landscape. We further examined the evolvability of these self-replicators and found that the evolvability of a self-replicator is dependent on its genomic architecture. We studied the differential ability of replicators to take over the population when competed against each other (akin to a primordial-soup model of biogenesis) and found that the probability of a self-replicator out-competing the others is not uniform. Instead, progenitor (most-recent common ancestor) genotypes are clustered in a small region of the replicator space. Our results demonstrate how computational systems can be used as test systems for hypotheses concerning the origin of life.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.03993v1', ['Populations and Evolution', 'Molecular Networks'], [u'Michigan State University']]
[u'Reactive immunization on complex networks', ['Eleonora Alfinito', 'Matteo Beccaria', 'Alberto Fachechi', 'Guido Macorini'], u'2017-01-14', u'Epidemic spreading on complex networks depends on the topological structure as well as on the dynamical properties of the infection itself. On general grounds, highly connected individuals and sites exposed to the infection have similar roles in the epidemic propagation. Motivated by this feature, we propose a novel vaccination scheme that exploits information from the details of the infection pattern at the vaccination time. Numerical simulations of the infection process show that the proposed immunization strategy is quite effective and robust on a wide class of complex networks.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.03943v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Evolutionary stability and the rarity of grandmothering', ['Jared M. Field', 'Michael B. Bonsall'], u'2017-01-14', u'The provision of intergenerational care, via the Grandmother Hypothesis, has been implicated in the evolution of post-fertile longevity, particularly in humans. However, if grandmothering does provide fitness benefits, a key question is why has it evolved so infrequently? We investigate this question with a combination of life-history and evolutionary game theory. We derive simple eligibility and stability thresholds, both of which must be satisfied if intergenerational care is first to evolve and then to persist in a population. As one threshold becomes easier to fulfill, the other becomes more difficult, revealing a conflict between the two. As such, we suggest that, in fact, we should expect the evolution of grandmothering to be rare.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.03883v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Topological Distances between Networks and Its Application to Brain Imaging', ['Hyekyoung Lee', 'Zhiwei Ma', 'Yuan Wang', 'Moo K. Chung'], u'2017-01-16', u'This paper surveys various distance measures for networks and graphs that were introduced in persistent homology. The scope of the paper is limited to network distances that were actually used in brain networks but the methods can be easily adapted to any weighted graph in other fields. The network version of Gromov-Hausdorff, bottleneck, kernel distances are introduced. We also introduce a recently developed KS-test like distance based on monotonic topology features such as the zeroth Betti number. Numerous toy examples and the result of applying many different distances to the brain networks of different clinical status and populations are given.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04171v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'A Computational Study on the Relation between Resting Heart Rate and Atrial Fibrillation Hemodynamics under Exercise', ['Matteo Anselmino', 'Stefania Scarsoglio', 'Andrea Saglietto', 'Fiorenzo Gaita', 'Luca Ridolfi'], u'2017-01-16', u'Aims. Clinical data indicating a heart rate (HR) target during rate control therapy for permanent atrial fibrillation (AF) and assessing its eventual relationship with reduced exercise tolerance are lacking. The present study aims at investigating the impact of resting HR on the hemodynamic response to exercise in permanent AF patients by means of a computational cardiovascular model. Methods. The AF lumped-parameter model was run to simulate resting (1 Metabolic Equivalent of Task-MET) and various exercise conditions (4 METs: brisk walking; 6 METs: skiing; 8 METs: running), considering different resting HR (70 bpm for the slower resting HR-SHR simulations, and 100 bpm for the higher resting HR-HHR simulations). To compare relative variations of cardiovascular variables upon exertion, the variation comparative index (VCI) - the absolute variation between the exercise and the resting values in SHR simulations referred to the absolute variation in HHR simulations -was calculated at each exercise grade (VCI4, VCI6 and VCI8). Results. Pulmonary venous pressure underwent a greater increase in HHR compared to SHR simulations (VCI4 = 0.71, VCI6 = 0.73 and VCI8 = 0.77), while for systemic arterial pressure the opposite is true (VCI4 = 1.15, VCI6 = 1.36, VCI8 = 1.56). Conclusions. The computational findings suggest that a slower, with respect to a higher resting HR, might be preferable in permanent AF patients, since during exercise pulmonary venous pressure undergoes a slighter increase and systemic blood pressure reveals a more appropriate increase.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04219v1', ['Tissues and Organs'], []]
[u'Statistical Mechanics of Allosteric Enzymes', ['Tal Einav', 'Linas Mazutis', 'Rob Phillips'], u'2017-01-15', u'The concept of allostery in which macromolecules switch between two different conformations is a central theme in biological processes ranging from gene regulation to cell signaling to enzymology. Allosteric enzymes pervade metabolic processes, yet a simple and unified treatment of the effects of allostery in enzymes has been lacking. In this work, we take the first step towards this goal by modeling allosteric enzymes and their interaction with two key molecular players - allosteric regulators and competitive inhibitors. We then apply this model to characterize existing data on enzyme activity, comment on how enzyme parameters (such as substrate binding affinity) can be experimentally tuned, and make novel predictions on how to control phenomena such as substrate inhibition.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.03988v1', ['Subcellular Processes'], []]
[u'Spindle assembly checkpoint is sufficient for complete Cdc20 sequestering in mitotic control', ['Bashar Ibrahim'], u'2016-11-19', u'The spindle checkpoint assembly (SAC) ensures genome fidelity by temporarily delaying anaphase onset, until all chromosomes are properly attached to the mitotic spindle. The SAC delays mitotic progression by preventing activation of the ubiquitin ligase anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C) or cyclosome; whose activation by Cdc20 is required for sister-chromatid separation marking the transition into anaphase. The mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC), which contains Cdc20 as a subunit, binds stably to the APC/C. Compelling evidence by Izawa and Pines (Nature 2014; 10.1038/nature13911) indicates that the MCC can inhibit a second Cdc20 that has already bound and activated the APC/C. Whether or not MCC per se is sufficient to fully sequester Cdc20 and inhibit APC/C remains unclear. Here, a dynamic model for SAC regulation in which the MCC binds a second Cdc20 was constructed. This model is compared to the MCC, and the MCC-and-BubR1 (dual inhibition of APC) core model variants and subsequently validated with experimental data from the literature. By using ordinary nonlinear differential equations and spatial simulations, it is shown that the SAC works sufficiently to fully sequester Cdc20 and completely inhibit APC/C activity. This study highlights the principle that a systems biology approach is vital for molecular biology and could also be used for creating hypotheses to design future experiments.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04316v1', ['Subcellular Processes'], []]
