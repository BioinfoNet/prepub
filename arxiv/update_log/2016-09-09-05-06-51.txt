[u'Not All Fluctuations are Created Equal: Spontaneous Variations in\n  Thermodynamic Function', ['James P. Crutchfield', 'Cina Aghamohammadi'], u'2016-09-08', u'Almost all processes -- highly correlated, weakly correlated, or correlated\nnot at all---exhibit statistical fluctuations. Often physical laws, such as the\nSecond Law of Thermodynamics, address only typical realizations -- as\nhighlighted by Shannon\'s asymptotic equipartition property and as entailed by\ntaking the thermodynamic limit of an infinite number of degrees of freedom.\nIndeed, our interpretations of the functioning of macroscopic thermodynamic\ncycles are so focused. Using a recently derived Second Law for information\nprocessing, we show that different subsets of fluctuations lead to distinct\nthermodynamic functioning in Maxwellian Demons. For example, while typical\nrealizations may operate as an engine -- converting thermal fluctuations to\nuseful work -- even "nearby" fluctuations (nontypical, but probable\nrealizations) behave differently, as Landauer erasers -- converting available\nstored energy to dissipate stored information. One concludes that ascribing a\nsingle, unique functional modality to a thermodynamic system, especially one on\nthe nanoscale, is at best misleading, likely masking an array of simultaneous,\nparallel thermodynamic transformations. This alters how we conceive of cellular\nprocesses, engineering design, and evolutionary adaptation.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02519v1', ['Biomolecules', 'Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Supervised Learning in Spiking Neural Networks with FORCE Training', ['Wilten Nicola', 'Claudia Clopath'], u'2016-09-08', u'Populations of neurons display an extraordinary diversity in the types of\nproblems they solve and behaviors they display. Examples include generating the\ncomplicated motor outputs involved in grasping motions to storing and recalling\na specific song for songbird mating. While it is still unknown how populations\nof neurons can learn to solve such a diverse set of problems, techniques have\nrecently emerged that allow us to determine how to couple neurons to form\nnetworks that solve tasks of similar complexity. The most versatile of these\napproaches are referred to as reservoir computing based techniques. Examples\ninclude the FORCE method, a novel technique that harnesses the chaos present in\na large, nonlinear system to learn arbitrary dynamics. Unfortunately, little\nwork has been done in directly applying FORCE training to spiking neural\nnetworks. Here, we demonstrate the direct applicability of the FORCE method to\nspiking neurons by training networks to mimic various dynamical systems. As\npopulations of neurons can display much more interesting behaviors then\nreproducing simple dynamical systems, we trained spiking neural networks to\nalso reproduce sophisticated tasks such as input classification and storing a\nprecise sequence that correspond to the notes of a song. For all the networks\ntrained, firing rates and spiking statistics were constrained to be within\nbiologically plausible regimes.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02545v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

[u'Three-dimensional network of Drosophila brain hemisphere', ['Ryuta Mizutani', 'Rino Saiga', 'Akihisa Takeuchi', 'Kentaro Uesugi', 'Yoshio Suzuki'], u'2016-09-08', u"The first step to understanding brain function is to determine the brain's\nnetwork structure. We report a three-dimensional analysis of the brain network\nof the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster by synchrotron-radiation tomographic\nmicroscopy. A skeletonized wire model of the left half of the brain network was\nbuilt by tracing the three-dimensional distribution of X-ray absorption\ncoefficients. The obtained models of neuronal processes were classified into\ngroups on the basis of their three-dimensional structures. These classified\ngroups correspond to neuronal tracts that send long-range projections or\nrepeated structures of the optic lobe. The skeletonized model is also composed\nof neuronal processes that could not be classified into the groups. The\ndistribution of these unclassified structures correlates with the distribution\nof contacts between neuronal processes. This suggests that neurons that cannot\nbe classified into typical structures should play important roles in brain\nfunctions. The quantitative description of the brain network provides a basis\nfor structural and statistical analyses of the Drosophila brain.

[u'Backpropagation of Hebbian plasticity for lifelong learning', ['Thomas Miconi'], u'2016-09-08', u'Hebbian plasticity allows biological agents to learn from their lifetime\nexperience, extending the fixed information provided by evolutionary search.\nConversely, backpropagation methods can build high-performance fixed-weights\nnetworks, but are not currently equipped to design networks with Hebbian\nconnections. Here we use backpropagation to train fully-differentiable plastic\nnetworks, such that backpropagation determines not only the baseline weights,\nbut also the plasticity of each connection. To perform this backpropagation of\nHebbian plasticity (BOHP), we derive error gradients for neural networks with\nHebbian plastic connections. The equations for these gradients turn out to\nfollow a simple, recursive form. We apply this method to train small networks\nfor simple learning tasks inspired from classical conditioning. We show that,\nthrough Hebbian plasticity, the networks perform fast learning of unpredictable\nenvironmental features during their lifetime, successfully solving a task that\nfixed-weight feedforward networks cannot possibly solve. We conclude that\nbackpropagation of Hebbian plasticity offers a powerful model for lifelong\nlearning.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02228v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Deconstructing Odorant Identity via Primacy in Dual Networks', ['Daniel Kepple', 'Hamza Giaffar', 'Dmitry Rinberg', 'Alexei Koulakov'], u'2016-09-07', u'In the olfactory system, odor percepts retain their identity despite\nsubstantial variations in concentration, timing, and background. We propose a\nnovel strategy for encoding intensity-invariant stimuli identity that is based\non representing relative rather than absolute values of the stimulus features.\nBecause, in this scheme, stimulus identity depends on relative amplitudes of\nstimulus features, identity becomes invariant with respect to variations in\nintensity and monotonous non-linearities of neuronal responses. In the\nolfactory system, stimulus identity can be represented by the identities of the\np strongest responding odorant receptor types out of a species dependent\ncomplement. We show that this information is sufficient to recover sparse\nstimuli (odorants) via elastic net loss minimization. Such a minimization has\nto be performed under constraints imposed by the relationships between stimulus\nfeatures. We map this problem onto the dual problem of minimizing a functional\nof Lagrange multipliers. The dual problem, in turn, can be solved by a neural\nnetwork whose Lyapunov function represents the dual Lagrangian. We thus propose\nthat networks in the piriform cortex compute odorant identity and implement\ndual computations with the sparse activities of individual neurons representing\nthe Lagrange multipliers.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02202v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Modeling the differentiation of A- and C-type baroreceptor firing\n  patterns', ['Jacob Sturdy', 'Johnny T Ottesen', 'Mette S Olufsen'], u'2016-09-07', u'The baroreceptor neurons serve as the primary transducers of blood pressure\nfor the autonomic nervous system and are thus critical in enabling the body to\nrespond effectively to changes in blood pressure. These neurons can be\nseparated into two types (A and C) based on the myelination of their axons and\ntheir distinct firing patterns elicited in response to specific pressure\nstimuli. This study has developed a comprehensive model of the afferent\nbaroreceptor discharge built on physiological knowledge of arterial wall\nmechanics, firing rate responses to controlled pressure stimuli, and ion\nchannel dynamics within the baroreceptor neurons. With this model, we were able\nto predict firing rates observed in previously published experiments in both A-\nand C-type neurons. These results were obtained by adjusting model parameters\ndetermining the maximal ion-channel conductances. The observed variation in the\nmodel parameters are hypothesized to correspond to physiological differences\nbetween A- and C-type neurons. In agreement with published experimental\nobservations, our simulations suggest that a twofold lower potassium\nconductance in C-type neurons is responsible for the observed sustained basal\nfiring, whereas a tenfold higher mechanosensitive conductance is responsible\nfor the greater firing rate observed in A-type neurons. A better understanding\nof the difference between the two neuron types can potentially be used to gain\nmore insight into the underlying pathophysiology facilitating development of\ntargeted interventions improving baroreflex function in diseased individuals,\ne.g. in patients with autonomic failure, a syndrome that is difficult to\ndiagnose in terms of its pathophysiology.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02535v1', ['Neurons and Cognition', 'Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Pathophysiological Domains Underlying the Metabolic Syndrome: An\n  Alternative Factor Analytic Strategy', ['Carel F. W. Peeters', 'James Dziura', 'Floryt van Wesel'], u'2016-09-08', u'Purpose: Factor analysis (FA) has become part and parcel in metabolic\nsyndrome (MBS) research. Both exploration- and confirmation-driven factor\nanalyzes are rampant. However, factor analytic results on MBS differ widely. A\nsituation that is at least in part attributable to misapplication of FA. Here,\nour purpose is (i) to review factor analytic efforts in the study of MBS with\nemphasis on misusage of the FA model and (ii) to propose an alternative factor\nanalytic strategy.\n  Methods: The proposed factor analytic strategy consists of four steps and\nconfronts weaknesses in application of the FA model. At its heart lies the\nexplicit separation of dimensionality and pattern selection as well as the\ndirect evaluation of competing inequality-constrained loading patterns. A\nhigh-profile MBS data set with anthropometric measurements on overweight\nchildren and adolescents is reanalyzed using this strategy.\n  Results: The reanalysis implied a more parsimonious constellation of\npathophysiological domains underlying phenotypic expressions of MBS than the\noriginal analysis (and many other analyzes). The results emphasize correlated\nfactors of impaired glucose metabolism and impaired lipid metabolism.\n  Conclusions: Pathophysiological domains underlying phenotypic expressions of\nMBS included in the analysis are driven by multiple interrelated metabolic\nimpairments. These findings indirectly point to the possible existence of a\nmultifactorial aetiology.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02313v1', ['Populations and Evolution', 'Quantitative Methods'], []]

[u'Unsupervised cryo-EM data clustering through adaptively constrained\n  K-means algorithm', ['Yaofang Xu', 'Jiayi Wu', 'Chang-Cheng Yin', 'Youdong Mao'], u'2016-09-07', u'In single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), K-means clustering\nalgorithm is widely used in unsupervised 2D classification of projection images\nof biological macromolecules. 3D ab initio reconstruction requires accurate\nunsupervised classification in order to separate molecular projections of\ndistinct orientations. Due to background noise in single-particle images and\nuncertainty of molecular orientations, traditional K-means clustering algorithm\nmay classify images into wrong classes and produce classes with a large\nvariation in membership. Overcoming these limitations requires further\ndevelopment on clustering algorithms for cryo-EM data analysis. We propose a\nnovel unsupervised data clustering method building upon the traditional K-means\nalgorithm. By introducing an adaptive constraint term in the objective\nfunction, our algorithm not only avoids a large variation in class sizes but\nalso produces more accurate data clustering. Applications of this approach to\nboth simulated and experimental cryo-EM data demonstrate that our algorithm is\na significantly improved alterative to the traditional K-means algorithm in\nsingle-particle cryo-EM analysis.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02213v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
