[u'A singular mutation in the hemagglutinin of the 1918 pandemic virus', ['Yves-Henri Sanejouand'], u'2016-10-14', u'The influenza pandemic of 1918-1919 killed at least 50 million people. The\nreasons why this pandemic was so deadly remain largely unknown. However, It has\nbeen shown that the 1918 viral hemagglutinin allows to reproduce the hallmarks\nof the illness observed during the original pandemic. Thanks to the wealth of\nhemagglutinin sequences accumulated over the last decades, amino-acid\nsubstitutions that are found in the 1918-1919 sequences but rare otherwise can\nbe identified with high confidence. Such an analysis reveals that Gly188, which\nis located within a key motif of the receptor binding site, is so rarely found\nin hemagglutinin sequences that, taken alone, it is likely to be deleterious.\nMonitoring this singular mutation in viral sequences may help prevent another\ndramatic pandemic.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04470v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Unfolding knots by proteasome-like systems: simulations of the behaviour\n  of folded and neurotoxic proteins', ['Micha Wojciechowski', 'Angel Gomez-Sicilia', 'Mariano Carrion-Vazquez', 'Marek Cieplak'], u'2016-10-13', u'Knots in proteins have been proposed to resist proteasomal degradation. Ample\nevidence associates proteasomal degradation with neurodegeneration. One\ninteresting possibility is that indeed knotted conformers stall this machinery\nleading to toxicity. However, although the proteasome is known to unfold\nmechanically its substrates, at present there are no experimental methods to\nemulate this particular traction geometry. Here, we consider several dynamical\nmodels of the proteasome in which the complex is represented by an effective\npotential with an added pulling force. This force is meant to induce\ntranslocation of a protein or a polypeptide into the catalytic chamber. The\nforce is either constant or applied periodically. The translocated proteins are\nmodelled in a coarse-grained fashion. We do comparative analysis of several\nknotted globular proteins and the transiently knotted polyglutamine tracts of\nlength 60 alone and fused in exon 1 of the huntingtin protein. Huntingtin is\nassociated with Huntington disease, a well-known genetically-determined\nneurodegenerative disease. We show that the presence of a knot hinders and\nsometimes even jams translocation. We demonstrate that the probability to do so\ndepends on the protein, the model of the proteasome, the magnitude of the\npulling force, and the choice of the pulled terminus. In any case, the net\neffect would be a hindrance in the proteasomal degradation process in the cell.\nThis would then yield toxicity \\textit{via} two different mechanisms: one\nthrough toxic monomers compromising degradation and another by the formation of\ntoxic oligomers. Our work paves the way to the mechanistic investigation of the\nmechanical unfolding of knotted structures by the proteasome and its relation\nto toxicity and disease.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04290v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Automatically tracking neurons in a moving and deforming brain', ['Jeffrey P. Nguyen', 'Ashley N. Linder', 'George S. Plummer', 'Joshua W. Shaevitz', 'Andrew M. Leifer'], u'2016-10-14', u"Advances in optical neuroimaging techniques now allow neural activity to be\nrecorded with cellular resolution in awake and behaving animals. Brain motion\nin these recordings pose a unique challenge. The location of individual neurons\nmust be tracked in 3D over time to accurately extract single neuron activity\ntraces. Recordings from small invertebrates like C. elegans are especially\nchallenging because they undergo very large brain motion and deformation during\nanimal movement. Here we present an automated computer vision pipeline to\nreliably track populations of neurons with single neuron resolution in the\nbrain of a freely moving C. elegans undergoing large motion and deformation. 3D\nvolumetric fluorescent images of the animal's brain are straightened, aligned\nand registered, and the locations of neurons in the images are found via\nsegmentation. Each neuron is then assigned an identity using a new\ntime-independent machine-learning approach we call Neuron Registration Vector\nEncoding. In this approach, non-rigid point-set registration is used to match\neach segmented neuron in each volume with a set of reference volumes taken from\nthroughout the recording. The way each neuron matches with the references\ndefines a feature vector which is clustered to assign an identity to each\nneuron in each volume. Finally, thin-plate spline interpolation is used to\ncorrect errors in segmentation and check consistency of assigned identities.\nThe Neuron Registration Vector Encoding approach proposed here is uniquely well\nsuited for tracking neurons in brains undergoing large deformations. When\napplied to whole-brain calcium imaging recordings in freely moving C. elegans,\nthis analysis pipeline located 150 neurons for the duration of an 8 minute\nrecording and consistently found more neurons more quickly than manual or\nsemi-automated approaches.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04579v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'The Robustness and the Doubly-Preferential Attachment Simulation of the\n  Consensus Connectome Dynamics of the Human Brain', ['Balazs Szalkai', 'Vince Grolmusz'], u'2016-10-14', u'The increasing quantity and quality of the publicly available human cerebral\ndiffusion MRI data make possible the study of the brain as it was unimaginable\nbefore. The Consensus Connectome Dynamics (CCD) is a remarkable phenomenon that\nwas discovered by continuously decreasing the minimum confidence-parameter at\nthe graphical interface of the Budapest Reference Connectome Server\n(\\url{http://connectome.pitgroup.org}). The Budapest Reference Connectome\nServer depicts the cerebral connections of $n=418$ subjects with a\nfrequency-parameter $k$: For any $k=1,2,...,n$ one can view the graph of the\nedges that are present in at least $k$ connectomes. If parameter $k$ is\ndecreased one-by-one from $k=n$ through $k=1$ then more and more edges appear\nin the graph, since the inclusion condition is relaxed. The surprising\nobservation is that the appearance of the edges is far from random: it\nresembles a growing, complex structure, like a tree or a shrub (visualized on\n\\url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxlyudPaVUE}). Here we examine the\nrobustness of the CCD phenomenon, and we show that it is almost independent of\nthe particular choice of the set of underlying individual connectomes, yielding\nthe CCD phenomenon. This result shows that the CCD phenomenon is very likely a\nbiological property of the human brain and not just a property of the data sets\nexamined. We also present a simulation that well-describes the growth of the\nCCD structure: in our random graph model a doubly-preferential attachment\ndistribution is found to mimic the CCD: a new edge appear with a probability\nproportional to the sum of the degrees of the endpoints of the new edge.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04568v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Differential roles for inhibition in excitatory rhythm generators', ['Kameron Decker Harris', 'Tatiana Dashevskiy', 'Joshua Mendoza', 'Alfredo J. Garcia III', 'Jan-Marino Ramirez', 'Eric Shea-Brown'], u'2016-10-13', u'Unraveling the interplay of excitation and inhibition within\nrhythm-generating networks remains a fundamental open issue in neuroscience. We\nuse a computational model to investigate the differential roles of local and\nlong-range inhibition in the respiratory network. Increasing inhibition within\na particular microcircuit, the so-called pre-B\\"otzinger complex, results in a\nlimited number of out-of-phase neurons before rhythmicity and synchrony\ndegenerate. Thus, unstructured local inhibition within this excitatory network\ncannot support the generation of more than one phase. Indeed, a two-phase\nrhythm requires restructuring the network into two microcircuits coupled by\nlong-range inhibition. Combining these computational results with recordings\nfrom respiratory circuits offers a paradigm where sparsely-coupled neurons act\ncollectively as synchronous rhythm generators. We hypothesize that this concept\napplies to a variety of rhythmic behaviors that emerge from coupled\nmicrocircuits.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04258v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'The Influence of Streamlined Music on Cognition and Mood', ['Julia Mossbridge'], u'2016-10-13', u'Recent advances in sound engineering have led to the development of so-called\nstreamlined music designed to reduce exogenous attention and improve endogenous\nattention. Although anecdotal reports suggest that streamlined music does\nindeed improve focus on daily work tasks and may improve mood, the specific\ninfluences of streamlined music on cognition and mood have yet to be examined.\nIn this paper, we report the results of a series of online experiments that\nexamined the impact of one form of streamlined music on cognition and mood. The\ntested form of streamlined music, which was tested primarily by listeners who\nfelt they benefited from this type of music, significantly outperformed plain\nmusic on measures of perceived focus, task persistence, precognition, and\ncreative thinking, with borderline effects on mood. In contrast, this same form\nof streamlined music did not significantly influence measures assessing visual\nattention, verbal memory, logical thinking, self-efficacy, perceived stress, or\nself-transcendence. We also found that improvements in perceived focus over a\n2-month period were correlated with improvements in emotional state, including\nmood. Overall the results suggest that at least for individuals who enjoy using\nstreamlined music as a focus tool, streamlined music can have a beneficial\nimpact on cognition without any obvious costs, while at the same time it may\npotentially boost mood.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04255v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

[u'Overcrowding drives the unjamming transition of gap-free monolayers', ['Tao Su', 'Ganhui Lan'], u'2016-10-13', u'Collective cell motility plays central roles in various biological phenomena\nsuch as inflammatory response, wound healing, cancer metastasis and\nembryogenesis. These are biological demonstrations of the unjamming transition.\nHowever, contradictory to the typical density-driven jamming processes in\nparticulate assemblies, cellular systems often get unjammed in highly packed,\nsometimes overcrowding tissue environments. In this work, we report that\novercrowding can unjam gap-free monolayers through increasing isotropic\ncompression. The transition boundary is determined by the isotropic compression\nand the cell-cell adhesion. We explicitly construct the free energy landscape\nfor the T1 topological transition during monolayer rearrangement, and find that\nit evolves from single-barrier shape to double-barrier shape upon completion of\nthe unjamming process. Our analyses reveal that the overcrowding and adhesion\ninduced unjamming transition reflects the mechanical yielding of the highly\ndeformable monolayer, which differs from those caused by loosing up a packed\nparticulate assembly.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04254v1', ['Cell Behavior'], []]
