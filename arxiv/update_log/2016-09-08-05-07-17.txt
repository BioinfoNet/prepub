[u'The allostery landscape: quantifying thermodynamic couplings in\n  biomolecular systems', ['Michel A. Cuendet', 'Harel Weinstein', 'Michael V. LeVine'], u'2016-09-07', u'Allostery plays a fundament role in most biological processes. However,\nlittle theory is available to describe it outside of two-state models. Here we\nuse a statistical mechanical approach to show that the allosteric coupling\nbetween two collective variables is not a single number, but instead a\ntwo-dimensional thermodynamic coupling function that is directly related to the\nmutual information from information theory and the copula density function from\nprobability theory. On this basis, we demonstrate how to quantify the\ncontribution of specific energy terms to this thermodynamic coupling function,\nenabling a decomposition that reveals the mechanism of allostery. We illustrate\nthe thermodynamic coupling function and its use by showing how allosteric\ncoupling in the alanine dipeptide molecule contributes to the overall shape of\nthe {\\Phi}/{\\Psi} free energy surface, and by identifying the interactions that\nare necessary for this coupling.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02059v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'CHSalign: A Web Server That Builds upon Junction-Explorer and RNAJAG for\n  Pairwise Alignment of RNA Secondary Structures with Coaxial Helical Stacking', ['Lei Hua', 'Yang Song', 'Namhee Kim', 'Christian Laing', 'Jason T. L. Wang', 'Tamar Schlick'], u'2016-09-05', u'RNA junctions are important structural elements of RNA molecules. They are\nformed when three or more helices come together in three-dimensional space.\nRecent studies have focused on the annotation and prediction of coaxial helical\nstacking (CHS) motifs within junctions. Here we exploit such predictions to\ndevelop an efficient alignment tool to handle RNA secondary structures with CHS\nmotifs. Specifically, we build upon our Junction-Explorer software for\npredicting coaxial stacking and RNAJAG for modelling junction topologies as\ntree graphs to incorporate constrained tree matching and dynamic programming\nalgorithms into a new method, called CHSalign, for aligning the secondary\nstructures of RNA molecules containing CHS motifs. Thus, CHSalign is intended\nto be an efficient alignment tool for RNAs containing similar junctions.\nExperimental results based on thousands of alignments demonstrate that CHSalign\ncan align two RNA secondary structures containing CHS motifs more accurately\nthan other RNA secondary structure alignment tools. CHSalign yields a high\nscore when aligning two RNA secondary structures with similar CHS motifs or\nhelical arrangement patterns, and a low score otherwise. This new method has\nbeen implemented in a web server, and the program is also made freely\navailable, at http://bioinformatics.njit.edu/CHSalign/.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01987v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Damage to white matter bottlenecks contributes to language impairments\n  after left hemispheric stroke', ['Joseph C. Griffis', 'Rodolphe Nenert', 'Jane B. Allendorfer', 'Jerzy P. Szaflarski'], u'2016-09-07', u'Damage to the white matter underlying the left posterior temporal lobe leads\nto deficits in multiple language functions. The posterior temporal white matter\nmay correspond to a bottleneck where both dorsal and ventral language pathways\nare vulnerable to simultaneous damage. Damage to a second putative white matter\nbottleneck in the left deep prefrontal white matter involving projections\nassociated with ventral language pathways and thalamo-cortical projections has\nrecently been proposed as a source of semantic deficits after stroke. However,\nthe effects of damage to a priori identified white matter bottlenecks on\nlanguage function have not been directly investigated. Here, we first used\nwhite matter atlases to identify the previously described white matter\nbottlenecks in the posterior temporal and deep prefrontal white matter. We then\nassessed the effects of damage to each region on measures of category fluency,\npicture naming, and auditory semantic decision-making in 43 patients with\nchronic aphasia. Damage to the posterior temporal bottleneck predicted deficits\non all language measures, while damage to the anterior bottleneck only\npredicted deficits in category fluency. Importantly, the effects of damage to\nthe bottleneck regions were not attributable to lesion volume, lesion loads on\nthe tracts traversing the bottlenecks, or damage to nearby cortical language\nareas. Multivariate lesion-symptom mapping and fiber tracking analyses\ncorroborated these findings. Together, our results provide strong support for\nthe proposal that spatially specific white matter damage affecting white matter\nbottlenecks, particularly in the posterior temporal lobe, contribute to chronic\nlanguage deficits after left hemispheric stroke. Our results suggest that\ndamage to this area is likely to simultaneously disrupt signaling via the\nsimultaneous disruption of dorsal and ventral language processing streams.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02114v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Brain Network Architecture: Implications for Human Learning', ['Marcelo G. Mattar', 'Danielle S. Bassett'], u'2016-09-07', u'Human learning is a complex phenomenon that requires adaptive processes\nacross a range of temporal and spacial scales. While our understanding of those\nprocesses at single scales has increased exponentially over the last few years,\na mechanistic understanding of the entire phenomenon has remained elusive. We\npropose that progress has been stymied by the lack of a quantitative framework\nthat can account for the full range of neurophysiological and behavioral\ndynamics both across scales in the systems and also across different types of\nlearning. We posit that network neuroscience offers promise in meeting this\nchallenge. Built on the mathematical fields of complex systems science and\ngraph theory, network neuroscience embraces the interconnected and hierarchical\nnature of human learning, offering insights into the emergent properties of\nadaptability. In this review, we discuss the utility of network neuroscience as\na tool to build a quantitative framework in which to study human learning,\nwhich seeks to explain the full chain of events in the brain from sensory input\nto motor output, being both biologically plausible and able to make predictions\nabout how an intervention at a single level of the chain may cause alterations\nin another level of the chain. We close by laying out important remaining\nchallenges in network neuroscience in explicitly bridging spatial scales at\nwhich neurophysiological processes occur, and underscore the utility of such a\nquantitative framework for education and therapy.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01790v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'An Investigation into the Mathematical Nature of Electrophysiological\n  Signals with Applications', ['Kaushik Majumdar', 'Anagh Pathak', 'Viswadeep Sarangi'], u'2016-09-03', u"In this work we have proposed a rigorous mathematical definition for the one\ndimensional time domain electrophysiological signals and established its\nrelationship with two of the three Dirichlet's conditions. We have argues that\nany such signal can be represented as the trajectory of a particle moving in a\nforce field with one degree of freedom. At point on the trajectory, that is, on\nthe signal, the kinetic energy dissipated by the particle embeds semantic\ninformation into the trajectory or the signal in terms of giving its shape. We\nhave shown that the rate of kinetic energy dissipation operator or the power\noperator P is of importance in shape analysis of the signal by considering its\nsign changes. Operating the P-operator on digital signals we have\nmathematically proved that its sign change can induce 13 different shapes to a\nthree successive point configuration. In other words, semantic information at\neach point in a digital signal can be embedded by a syllable of 13 different\nletters. We have shown some preliminary applications.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02081v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Classification of syncope through data analytics', ['Joseph Hart', 'Jesper Mehlsen', 'Christian H. Olsen', 'Mette Sofie Olufsen', 'Pierre Gremaud'], u'2016-09-06', u'Objective: Syncope is a sudden loss of consciousness with loss of postural\ntone and spontaneous recovery; it is a common condition, albeit one that is\nchallenging to accurately diagnose. Uncertainties about the triggering\nmechanisms and their underlying pathophysiology have led to various\nclassifications of patients exhibiting this symptom. This study presents a new\nway to classify syncope types using machine learning. Method: we hypothesize\nthat syncope types can be characterized by analyzing blood pressure and heart\nrate time series data obtained from the head-up tilt test procedure. By\noptimizing classification rates, we identify a small number of determining\nmarkers which enable data clustering. Results: We apply the proposed method to\nclinical data from 157 subjects; each subject was identified by an expert as\nbeing either healthy or suffering from one of three conditions:\ncardioinhibitory syncope, vasodepressor syncope and postural orthostatic\ntachycardia. Clustering confirms the three disease groups and identifies two\ndistinct subgroups within the healthy controls. Conclusion: The proposed method\nprovides evidence to question current syncope classifications; it also offers\nmeans to refine them. Significance: Current syncope classifications are not\nbased on pathophysiology and have not led to significant improvements in\npatient care. It is expected that a more faithful classification will\nfacilitate our understanding of the autonomic system for healthy subjects,\nwhich is essential in analyzing pathophysiology of the disease groups.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02049v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]

Subsequently we manipulated\nmitochondrial morphology using two interventions with opposite effects:\nover-expression of mitofusin 1, a protein that promotes mitochondria fusion,\nand paraquat treatment, a compound that induces mitochondrial fragmentation due\nto oxidative stress. Quantitative analysis of the organelle's structural\nclusters revealed that healthy mitochondrial networks were in a status\nintermediate between the extremes of highly fragmented and completely fusioned\nnetworks. This was confirmed by a comparison of our empirical findings with\nthose of a recently described computational model of network growth based on\nfusion-fission balance.

Camley', 'Yanxiang Zhao', 'Bo Li', 'Herbert Levine', 'Wouter-Jan Rappel'], u'2016-09-06', u'We study a minimal model of a crawling eukaryotic cell with a chemical\npolarity controlled by a reaction-diffusion mechanism describing Rho GTPase\ndynamics. The size, shape, and speed of the cell emerge from the combination of\nthe chemical polarity, which controls the locations where actin polymerization\noccurs, and the physical properties of the cell, including its membrane\ntension. We find in our model both highly persistent trajectories, in which the\ncell crawls in a straight line, and turning trajectories, where the cell\ntransitions from crawling in a line to crawling in a circle. We discuss the\ncontrolling variables for this turning instability, and argue that turning\narises from a coupling between the reaction-diffusion mechanism and the shape\nof the cell. This emphasizes the surprising features that can arise from simple\nlinks between cell mechanics and biochemistry. Our results suggest that similar\ninstabilities may be present in a broad class of biochemical descriptions of\ncell polarity.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01764v1', ['Cell Behavior'], []]

Vsevolozhskaya', 'Chia-Ling Kuo', 'Gabriel Ruiz', 'Luda Diatchenko', 'Dmitri V. Zaykin'], u'2016-09-07', u'Increasing accessibility of data to researchers makes it possible to conduct\nmassive amounts of statistical testing. Rather than follow a carefully crafted\nset of scientific hypotheses with statistical analysis, researchers can now\ntest many possible relations and let P-values or other statistical summaries\ngenerate hypotheses for them. Genetic epidemiology field is an illustrative\ncase in this paradigm shift. Driven by technological advances, testing a\nhandful of genetic variants in relation to a health outcome has been abandoned\nin favor of agnostic screening of the entire genome, followed by selection of\ntop hits, e.g., by selection of genetic variants with the smallest association\nP-values. At the same time, nearly total lack of replication of claimed\nassociations that has been shaming the field turned to a flow of reports whose\nfindings have been robustly replicating. Researchers may have adopted better\nstatistical practices by learning from past failures, but we suggest that a\nsteep increase in the amount of statistical testing itself is an important\nfactor. Regardless of whether statistical significance has been reached, an\nincreased number of tested hypotheses leads to enrichment of smallest P-values\nwith genuine associations. In this study, we quantify how the expected\nproportion of genuine signals (EPGS) among top hits changes with an increasing\nnumber of tests. When the rate of occurrence of genuine signals does not\ndecrease too sharply to zero as more tests are performed, the smallest P-values\nare increasingly more likely to represent genuine associations in studies with\nmore tests.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01788v1', ['Genomics'], []]
