[u'Claws, Disorder, and Conformational Dynamics of the C-terminal Region of\n  Human Desmoplakin', ['Charles E. McAnany', 'Cameron Mura'], u'2016-06-08', u"Multicellular organisms consist of cells that interact via elaborate adhesion\ncomplexes. Desmosomes are membrane-associated adhesion complexes that\nmechanically tether the cytoskeletal intermediate filaments (IFs) between two\nadjacent cells, creating a network of tough connections in tissues such as skin\nand heart. Desmoplakin (DP) is the key desmosomal protein that binds IFs, and\nthe DP-IF association poses a quandary: desmoplakin must stably and tightly\nbind IFs to maintain the structural integrity of the desmosome. Yet, newly\nsynthesized DP must traffick along the cytoskeleton to the site of nascent\ndesmosome assembly without 'sticking' to the IF network, implying weak or\ntransient DP--IF contacts. Recent work reveals that these contacts are\nmodulated by post-translational modifications (PTMs) in DP's C-terminal tail.\nUsing molecular dynamics simulations, we have elucidated the structural basis\nof these PTM-induced effects. Our simulations, nearing 2 microseconds in\naggregate, indicate that phosphorylation of S2849 induces an 'arginine claw' in\ndesmoplakin's C-terminal tail (DPCTT). If a key arginine, R2834, is methylated,\nthe DPCTT preferentially samples conformations that are geometrically\nwell-suited as substrates for processive phosphorylation by the cognate kinase\nGSK3. We suggest that DPCTT is a molecular switch that modulates, via its\nconformational dynamics, DP's efficacy as a substrate for GSK3. Finally, we\nshow that the fluctuating DPCTT can contact other parts of DP, suggesting a\ncompetitive binding mechanism for the modulation of DP--IF interactions.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02737v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Modeling the dynamics of human brain activity with recurrent neural\n  networks', ['Umut Guclu', 'Marcel A. J. van Gerven'], u'2016-06-09', u'Encoding models are used for predicting brain activity in response to sensory\nstimuli with the objective of elucidating how sensory information is\nrepresented in the brain. Encoding models typically comprise a nonlinear\ntransformation of stimuli to features (feature model) and a linear\ntransformation of features to responses (response model). While there has been\nextensive work on developing better feature models, the work on developing\nbetter response models has been rather limited. Here, we investigate the extent\nto which recurrent neural network models can use their internal memories for\nnonlinear processing of arbitrary feature sequences to predict feature-evoked\nresponse sequences as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging. We\nshow that the proposed recurrent neural network models can significantly\noutperform established response models by accurately estimating long-term\ndependencies that drive hemodynamic responses.

Although decoding methods have been\nextensively applied in Brain Computing Interfaces (BCI), these methods have\nonly recently been applied to time-series neuroimaging data such as MEG and EEG\nto address experimental questions in Cognitive Neuroscience. In a\ntutorial-style review, we describe a broad set of options to inform future\ntime-series decoding studies from a Cognitive Neuroscience perspective. Using\nexample MEG data, we illustrate some effects that different options in the\ndecoding analysis pipeline can have on experimental results where the aim is to\n'decode' different perceptual stimuli or cognitive states over time from\ndynamic brain activation patterns. We show that decisions made at both\npreprocessing (e.g. dimensionality reduction, subsampling, trial averaging) and\ndecoding (e.g. classifier selection, cross-validation design) stages of the\nanalysis can significantly affect the results. In addition to standard\ndecoding, we describe extensions to MVPA for time-varying neuroimaging data\nincluding representational similarity analysis, temporal generalisation, and\nthe interpretation of classifier weight maps.

Earlier work looks at individual properties or performance\ncriteria and occasionally a combination of two, such as energy and information.\nHere we make use of Jaynes' maximum entropy method and combine a larger set of\nconstraints, possibly dimensionally distinct, each expressible as an\nexpectation. The method identifies a likelihood-function and a sufficient\nstatistic arising from each such optimization. This likelihood is a\nfirst-hitting time distribution in the exponential class. Particular constraint\nsets are identified that, from an optimal inference perspective, justify\nearlier neurocomputational models. Interactions between constraints, mediated\nthrough the inferred likelihood, restrict constraint-set parameterizations,\ne.g., the energy-budget limits estimation performance which, in turn, matches\nan axonal communication constraint. Such linkages are, for biologists,\nexperimental predictions of the method. In addition to the related likelihood,\nat least one type of constraint set implies marginal distributions, and in this\ncase, a Shannon bits/joule statement arises.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03063v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Consistency and convergence rate of phylogenetic inference via\n  regularization', ['Vu Dinh', 'Lam Si Tung Ho', 'Marc A. Suchard', 'Frederick A. Matsen IV'], u'2016-06-09', u'It is common in phylogenetics to have some, perhaps partial, information\nabout the overall evolutionary tree of a group of organisms and wish to find an\nevolutionary tree of a specific gene for those organisms. There may not be\nenough information in the gene sequences alone to accurately reconstruct the\ncorrect "gene tree." Although the gene tree may deviate from the "species tree"\ndue to a variety of genetic processes, in the absence of evidence to the\ncontrary it is parsimonious to assume that they agree. A common statistical\napproach in these situations is to develop a likelihood penalty to incorporate\nsuch additional information. Recent studies using simulation and empirical data\nsuggest that a likelihood penalty quantifying concordance with a species tree\ncan significantly improve the accuracy of gene tree reconstruction compared to\nusing sequence data alone. However, the consistency of such an approach has not\nyet been established, nor have convergence rates been bounded. Because\nphylogenetics is a non-standard inference problem, the standard theory does not\napply. In this paper, we propose a penalized maximum likelihood estimator for\ngene tree reconstruction, where the penalty is the square of the\nBillera-Holmes-Vogtmann geodesic distance from the gene tree to the species\ntree. We prove that this method is consistent, and derive its convergence rate\nfor estimating the discrete gene tree structure and continuous edge lengths\n(representing the amount of evolution that has occurred on that branch)\nsimultaneously. We find that the regularized estimator is "adaptive fast\nconverging," meaning that it can reconstruct all edges of length greater than\nany given threshold from gene sequences of polynomial length. Our method does\nnot require the species tree to be known exactly; in fact, our asymptotic\ntheory holds for any such guide tree.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03059v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

[u'Identifying statistically significant patterns in gene expression data', ['Patrick E. McSharry', 'Edmund J.

Co-regulation, and involvement of\ngenes in similar cellular function, is subsequently inferred from the clusters\nwhich are obtained. Increasingly sophisticated algorithms have been applied to\nmicroarray data, however, less attention has been given to the statistical\nsignificance of the results of clustering studies. We present a technique for\nthe analysis of commonly used hierarchical linkage-based clustering called\nSignificance Analysis of Linkage Trees (SALT).\n  Results: The statistical significance of pairwise similarity levels between\ngene expression profiles, a measure of co-expression, is established using a\nsurrogate data analysis method. We find that a modified version of the standard\nlinkage technique, complete-linkage, must be used to generate hierarchical\nlinkage trees with the appropriate properties. The approach is illustrated\nusing synthetic data generated from a novel model of gene expression profiles\nand is then applied to previously analysed microarray data on the\ntranscriptional response of human fibroblasts to serum stimulation.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02801v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]

[u'Maximal switchability of centralized networks', ['Sergei Vakulenko', 'Ivan Morozov', 'Ovidiu Radulescu'], u'2016-06-09', u'We consider continuous time Hopfield-like recurrent networks as dynamical\nmodels for gene regulation and neural networks. We are interested in networks\nthat contain n high-degree nodes preferably connected to a large number of Ns\nweakly connected satellites, a property that we call n/Ns-centrality. If the\nhub dynamics is slow, we obtain that the large time network dynamics is\ncompletely defined by the hub dynamics. Moreover, such networks are maximally\nflexible and switchable, in the sense that they can switch from a globally\nattractive rest state to any structurally stable dynamics when the response\ntime of a special controller hub is changed. In particular, we show that a\ndecrease of the controller hub response time can lead to a sharp variation in\nthe network attractor structure: we can obtain a set of new local attractors,\nwhose number can increase exponentially with N, the total number of nodes of\nthe nework. These new attractors can be periodic or even chaotic. We provide an\nalgorithm, which allows us to design networks with the desired switching\nproperties, or to learn them from time series, by adjusting the interactions\nbetween hubs and satellites. Such switchable networks could be used as models\nfor context dependent adaptation in functional genetics or as models for\ncognitive functions in neuroscience.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02859v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
