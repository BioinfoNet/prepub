[u'The role of zero synapses in unsupervised feature learning', ['Haiping Huang'], u'2017-03-23', u'Synapses in real neural circuits can take discrete values, including zero (silent or potential) synapses. The computational role of zero synapses in unsupervised feature learning of unlabeled noisy data is still unclear, yet important to understand how the sparseness of synaptic activity is shaped during learning and its relationship with receptive field formation. Here, we formulate this kind of sparse feature learning by statistical mechanics approach. We find that learning decreases the fraction of zero synapses, and when the fraction decreases rapidly around a critical data size, the intrinsically structured receptive field starts to develop. Further increasing the data size refines the receptive field, while a very small fraction of zero synapses remain to act as contour detectors. This feature is discovered not only in a handwritten digits dataset, but also in retinal neural activity measured in a natural movie stimuli experiment.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07943v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Adversarial synapses: Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning optimizes min-max objectives', ['Cengiz Pehlevan', 'Anirvan Sengupta', 'Dmitri B. Chklovskii'], u'2017-03-23', u'A promising approach towards understanding neural networks is to view them as implementations of online algorithms optimizing principled objectives. Existing neural algorithms capturing both neural activity dynamics and synaptic weight updates implement the same operation, either minimization or maximization of the objective, with respect to each variable. Here, we derive neural networks from principled min-max objectives: by minimizing with respect to neural activity and feedforward synaptic weights, and maximizing with respect to lateral synaptic weights. In turn, the min-max objectives are obtained via the Hubbard-Stratonovich (HS) transform of similarity matching objectives. The resulting networks perform dimensionality reduction of the input data resorting only to biologically plausible local learning rules. The min-max nature of the objective is reflected in the antagonism between Hebbian feedforward and anti-Hebbian lateral learning in derived networks. We prove that the only stable fixed points of the network dynamics correspond to the principal subspace projection (PSP) or the principal subspace whitening (PSW). Finally, from the min-max objectives we derive novel formulations of dimensionality reduction using fractional matrix exponents.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07914v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Quantification of avoidable yield losses in oilseed Brassica caused by insect pests', ['Jagdev Singh Kular', 'Sarwan Kumar'], u'2017-03-23', u'A six year field study was conducted from 2001 2002 to 2006 2007 at Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana, India to study the losses in seed yield of different Brassica species (B. juncea, B. napus, B. carinata, B. rapa and Eruca sativa) by the infestation of insect pests. The experiment was conducted in two different sets viz. protected/sprayed and unprotected, in a randomized block design, with three replications. Data on the infestation of insect pests, and seed yield were recorded at weekly intervals and at harvest, respectively. The loss in seed yield, due to mustard aphid and cabbage caterpillar, varied from 6.5 to 26.4 per cent. E. sativa suffered the least loss in seed yield and harboured the minimum population of mustard aphid (2.1 aphids/plant) and cabbage caterpillar (2.4 larvae/plant). On the other hand, B. carinata was highly susceptible to the cabbage caterpillar (26.2 larvae/plant) and suffered the maximum yield loss (26.4%).', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07996v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Biochemical mechanism of resistance in some Brassica genotypes against Lipaphis erysimi (Kaltenbach) (Homoptera: Aphididae)', ['Sarwan Kumar', 'M. K. Sangha'], u'2017-03-23', u'Two years study was carried out during 2006-07 and 2007-08 crop seasons to study the response of different genotypes of oilseeds Brassica to Lipaphis erysimi (Kaltenbach) infestation both under field and screen house conditions and to find out the relationship of various biochemical constituents to aphid infestation. Among the various genotypes, the population of L. erysimi was significantly high on Brassica rapa variety brown sarson cv. BSH 1 and B. rapa var. yellow sarson cv. YST 151 in unprotected set i.e. 53.7 and 52.3 aphids/ plant, respectively. However, it was the lowest on Eruca sativa cv. T 27 (4.7 aphids/plant) followed by B. carinata cv. DLSC 2 (20.9 aphids/ plant) which suffered the least yield loss i.e. 5.79 and 10.59 per cent, respectively. Almost similar trend was observed in seedling mortality, which was the maximum in BSH 1 and YST 151, while no seedling mortality was observed in the case of T 27 during both the years of study. Analysis of various biochemical constituents revealed that glucosinolates, total phenols and ortho-dihydroxy phenols had inverse relationship with the aphid infestation. Higher amount of these biochemical constituents in T 27 and DLSC 2 was responsible for lower aphid infestation on these genotypes.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07992v1', ['Other'], []]
[u'SIMLR: a tool for large-scale single-cell analysis by multi-kernel learning', ['Bo Wang', 'Daniele Ramazzotti', 'Luca De Sano', 'Junjie Zhu', 'Emma Pierson', 'Serafim Batzoglou'], u'2017-03-21', u'Motivation: We here present SIMLR (Single-cell Interpretation via Multi-kernel LeaRning), an open-source tool that implements a novel framework to learn a cell-to-cell similarity measure from single-cell RNA-seq data. SIMLR can be effectively used to perform tasks such as dimension reduction, clustering, and visualization of heterogeneous populations of cells. SIMLR was benchmarked against state-of-the-art methods for these three tasks on several public datasets, showing it to be scalable and capable of greatly improving clustering performance, as well as providing valuable insights by making the data more interpretable via better a visualization. Availability and Implementation: SIMLR is available on GitHub in both R and MATLAB implementations. Furthermore, it is also available as an R package on bioconductor.org.

[u'Termite mounds harness diurnal temperature oscillations for ventilation', ['Hunter King', 'Samuel A. Ocko', 'L. Mahadevan'], u'2017-03-19', u'Many species of millimetric fungus-harvesting termites collectively build uninhabited, massive mound structures enclosing a network of broad tunnels which protrude from the ground meters above their subterranean nests. It is widely accepted that the purpose of these mounds is to give the colony a controlled micro-climate in which to raise fungus and brood by managing heat, humidity, and respiratory gas exchange. While different hypotheses such as steady and fluctuating external wind and internal metabolic heating have been proposed for ventilating the mound, the absence of direct in-situ measurement of internal air flows has precluded a definitive mechanism for this critical physiological function. By measuring diurnal variations in flow through the surface conduits of the mounds of the species Odontotermes obesus, we show that a simple combination of geometry, heterogeneous thermal mass and porosity allows the mounds to use diurnal ambient temperature oscillations for ventilation. In particular, the thin outer flute-like conduits heat up rapidly during the day relative to the deeper chimneys, pushing air up the flutes and down the chimney in a closed convection cell, with the converse situation at night. These cyclic flows in the mound flush out $\\text{CO}_2$ from the nest and ventilate the colony, in a novel example of deriving useful work from thermal oscillations.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08067v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Development and characterization of Brassica juncea fruticulosa introgression lines exhibiting resistance to mustard aphid', ['Chhaya Atri', 'Bharti Kumar', 'Hitesh Kumar', 'Sanjula Sharma', 'Surinder S. Banga'], u'2017-03-23', u'Background: Mustard aphid is a major pest of Brassica oilseeds. No source for aphid resistance is presently available in Brassica juncea . A wild crucifer, Brassica fruticulosa is known to be resistant to mustard aphid. An artificially synthesized amphiploid, AD-4 (B. fruticulosa x B. rapa var. brown sarson) was developed for use as a bridge species to transfer fruticulosa resistance to B. juncea. Using the selfed backcross we could select a large number of lines with resistance to mustard aphid. This paper reports cytogenetic stability of introgression lines, molecular evidence for alien introgression and their reaction to mustard aphid infestation. Results: Majority of introgression lines had expected euploid chromosome number(2n= 36), showed normal meiosis and high pollen grain fertility. Well-distributed and transferable simple-sequence repeats (SSR) markers for all the 18 B. juncea chromosomes helped to characterize introgression events. Average proportions of recipient and donor genome in the substitution lines were 49.72 and 35.06%, respectively. Minimum alien parent genome presence (27.29%) was observed in the introgression line, Ad3K-280 . Introgressed genotypes also varied for their resistance responses to mustard aphid infestations under artificial release conditions for two continuous seasons. Some of the test genotypes showed consistent resistant reaction. Conclusions: B.juncea-fruticulosa introgression set may prove to be a very powerful breeding tool for aphid resistance related QTL/gene discovery and fine mapping of the desired genes/QTLs to facilitate marker assisted transfer of identified gene(s) for mustard aphid resistance in the background of commercial mustard genotypes.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07987v1', ['Genomics'], []]
