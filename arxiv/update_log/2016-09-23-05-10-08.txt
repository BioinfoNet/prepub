[u'Stiffness of the C-terminal disordered linker affects the geometry of\n  the active site in endoglucanase Cel8A', ['Bartosz Rozycki', 'Marek Cieplak'], u'2016-09-22', u'Cellulosomes are complex multi-enzyme machineries which efficiently degrade\nplant cell-wall polysaccharides. The multiple domains of the cellulosome\nproteins are often tethered together by intrinsically disordered regions. The\nproperties and functions of these disordered linkers are not well understood.\nIn this work, we study endoglucanase Cel8A, which is a relevant enzymatic\ncomponent of the cellulosomes of Clostridium thermocellum. We use both all-atom\nand coarse-grained simulations to investigate how the equilibrium conformations\nof the catalytic domain of Cel8A are affected by the disordered linker at its C\nterminus. We find that when the endoglucanase is bound to its substrate, the\neffective stiffness of the linker can influence the distances between groups of\namino-acid residues throughout the entire enzymatic domain. In particular,\nvariations in the linker stiffness can lead to small changes in the geometry of\nthe active-site cleft. We suggest that such geometrical changes may, in turn,\nhave an effect on the catalytic activity of the enzyme.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07000v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]

Mortadella', 'Yaroslav Kholodov', 'David W. Ritchie', 'Sandor Vajda', 'Dima Kozakov'], u'2016-09-21', u'Energy evaluation using fast Fourier transforms enables sampling billions of\nputative complex structures and hence revolutionized rigid protein-protein\ndocking. However, in current methods efficient acceleration is achieved only in\neither the translational or the rotational subspace. Developing an efficient\nand accurate docking method that expands FFT based sampling to 5 rotational\ncoordinates is an extensively studied but still unsolved problem. The algorithm\npresented here retains the accuracy of earlier methods but yields at least\ntenfold speedup. The improvement is due to two innovations. First, the search\nspace is treated as the product manifold $\\mathbf{SO(3)x(SO(3)\\setminus S^1)}$,\nwhere $\\mathbf{SO(3)}$ is the rotation group representing the space of the\nrotating ligand, and $\\mathbf{(SO(3)\\setminus S^1)}$ is the space spanned by\nthe two Euler angles that define the orientation of the vector from the center\nof the fixed receptor toward the center of the ligand. This representation\nenables the use of efficient FFT methods developed for $\\mathbf{SO(3)}$.\nSecond, we select the centers of highly populated clusters of docked\nstructures, rather than the lowest energy conformations, as predictions of the\ncomplex, and hence there is no need for very high accuracy in energy\nevaluation. Therefore it is sufficient to use a limited number of spherical\nbasis functions in the Fourier space, which increases the efficiency of\nsampling while retaining the accuracy of docking results. A major advantage of\nthe method is that, in contrast to classical approaches, increasing the number\nof correlation function terms is computationally inexpensive, which enables\nusing complex energy functions for scoring.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.06743v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]

Using a large deviation\nprinciple, we prove the stability of the synchronized state under stochastic\nperturbations. Then, we give a lower bound on the probability of\nsynchronization for networks which are not initially synchronized. This bound\nshows the robustness of the emergence of synchronization in presence of small\nstochastic perturbations.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07103v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Mechanisms underlying different onset patterns of focal seizures', ['Yujiang Wang', 'Andrew J Trevelyan', 'Peter N Taylor', 'Antonio Valentin', 'Gonzalo Alarcon', 'Marcus Kaiser'], u'2016-09-22', u'Focal seizures are episodes of pathological brain activity that arise from a\nlocalised area of the brain. The onset patterns of focal seizure activity have\nbeen studied intensively, and they can largely be distinguished into two types.\nHere we explore whether these two patterns arise from fundamentally different\nmechanisms.\n  Using a previously established computational model of neocortical tissue, we\nshow that the two types of onset pattern can be distinguished based on the\nexcitability of the "healthy" surrounding tissue, which by itself does not\ngenerate seizures, but can support seizure activity when incited. The\ndifference in surrounding tissue excitability also predicts a difference in\nsurgical outcomes for the two patterns in the model, which appears to be\nconfirmed by clinical literature. Finally, we demonstrate how changes in tissue\nexcitability could be tracked using active stimulation.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07068v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'An equivalence between high dimensional Bayes optimal inference and\n  M-estimation', ['Madhu Advani', 'Surya Ganguli'], u'2016-09-22', u'When recovering an unknown signal from noisy measurements, the computational\ndifficulty of performing optimal Bayesian MMSE (minimum mean squared error)\ninference often necessitates the use of maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference, a\nspecial case of regularized M-estimation, as a surrogate. However, MAP is\nsuboptimal in high dimensions, when the number of unknown signal components is\nsimilar to the number of measurements. In this work we demonstrate, when the\nsignal distribution and the likelihood function associated with the noise are\nboth log-concave, that optimal MMSE performance is asymptotically achievable\nvia another M-estimation procedure. This procedure involves minimizing convex\nloss and regularizer functions that are nonlinearly smoothed versions of the\nwidely applied MAP optimization problem. Our findings provide a new heuristic\nderivation and interpretation for recent optimal M-estimators found in the\nsetting of linear measurements and additive noise, and further extend these\nresults to nonlinear measurements with non-additive noise. We numerically\ndemonstrate superior performance of our optimal M-estimators relative to MAP.\nOverall, at the heart of our work is the revelation of a remarkable equivalence\nbetween two seemingly very different computational problems: namely that of\nhigh dimensional Bayesian integration underlying MMSE inference, and high\ndimensional convex optimization underlying M-estimation. In essence we show\nthat the former difficult integral may be computed by solving the latter,\nsimpler optimization problem.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07060v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

L. da Silva'], u'2016-09-22', u'In times of plenty expectations rise, just as in times of crisis they fall.\nThis can be mathematically described as a Win-Stay-Lose-Shift strategy with\ndynamic aspiration levels, where individuals aspire to be as wealthy as their\naverage neighbor. Here we investigate this model in the realm of evolutionary\nsocial dilemmas on the square lattice and scale-free networks. By using the\nmaster equation and Monte Carlo simulations, we find that cooperators coexist\nwith defectors in the whole phase diagram, even at high temptations to defect.\nWe study the microscopic mechanism that is responsible for the striking\npersistence of cooperative behavior and find that cooperation spreads through\nsecond-order neighbors, rather than by means of network reciprocity that\ndominates in imitation-based models. For the square lattice the master equation\ncan be solved analytically in the large temperature limit of the Fermi\nfunction, while for other cases the resulting differential equations must be\nsolved numerically. Either way, we find good qualitative agreement with the\nMonte Carlo simulation results. Our analysis also reveals that the evolutionary\noutcomes are to a large degree independent of the network topology, including\nthe number of neighbors that are considered for payoff determination on\nlattices, which further corroborates the local character of the microscopic\ndynamics. Unlike large-scale spatial patterns that typically emerge due to\nnetwork reciprocity, here local checkerboard-like patterns remain virtually\nunaffected by differences in the macroscopic properties of the interaction\nnetwork.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07118v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Predicting evolutionary rescue via evolving plasticity in stochastic\n  environments', ['Jaime Ashander', 'Luis-Miguel Chevin', 'Marissa L. Baskett'], u'2016-09-21', u'Phenotypic plasticity and its evolution may help evolutionary rescue in a\nnovel and stressful environment, especially if environmental novelty reveals\ncryptic genetic variation that enables the evolution of increased plasticity.\nHowever, the environmental stochasticity ubiquitous in natural systems may\nalter these predictions because high plasticity may amplify\nphenotype-environment mismatches. Although previous studies have highlighted\nthis potential detrimental effect of plasticity in stochastic environments,\nthey have not investigated how it affects extinction risk in the context of\nevolutionary rescue and with evolving plasticity. We investigate this question\nhere by integrating stochastic demography with quantitative genetic theory in a\nmodel with simultaneous change in the mean and predictability (temporal\nautocorrelation) of the environment. We develop an approximate prediction of\nlong-term persistence under the new pattern of environmental fluctuations, and\ncompare it with numerical simulations for short- and long-term extinction risk.\nWe find that reduced predictability increases extinction risk and reduces\npersistence because it increases stochastic load during rescue. This\nunderstanding of how stochastic demography, phenotypic plasticity, and\nevolution interact when evolution acts on cryptic genetic variation revealed in\na novel environment can inform expectations for invasions, extinctions, or the\nemergence of chemical resistance in pests.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.06763v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

We study the impact of population\ngrowth has on the success of mutants. To systematically understand the effects\nof growth we decouple competition from reproduction; competition follows a\nbirth--death process and is governed by an evolutionary game, while growth is\ndetermined by an externally controlled branching rate. In stochastic\nsimulations we find non-monotonic behaviour of the fixation probability of\nmutants as the speed of growth is varied; the right amount of growth can lead\nto a higher success rate. These results are observed in both coordination and\ncoexistence game scenarios, and we find that the 'one-third law' for\ncoordination games can break down in the presence of growth.
