[u'What can topology tell us about the neural code?', ['Carina Curto'], u'2016-05-06', u'Neuroscience is undergoing a period of rapid experimental progress and\nexpansion. New mathematical tools, previously unknown in the neuroscience\ncommunity, are now being used to tackle fundamental questions and analyze\nemerging data sets. Consistent with this trend, the last decade has seen an\nuptick in the use of topological ideas and methods in neuroscience. In this\ntalk I will survey recent applications of topology in neuroscience, and explain\nwhy topology is an especially natural tool for understanding neural codes.\nNote: This is a write-up of my talk for the Current Events Bulletin, held at\nthe 2016 Joint Math Meetings in Seattle, WA.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01905v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Neural mechanisms underlying catastrophic failure in human-machine\n  interaction during aerial navigation', ['Sameer Saproo', 'Victor Shih', 'David C. Jangraw', 'Paul Sajda'], u'2016-05-05', u'Objective. We investigated the neural correlates of workload buildup in a\nfine visuomotor task called the boundary avoidance task (BAT). The BAT has been\nknown to induce naturally occurring failures of human-machine coupling in high\nperformance aircraft that can potentially lead to a crash; these failures are\ntermed pilot induced oscillations (PIOs). Approach. We recorded EEG and\npupillometry data from human subjects engaged in a flight BAT simulated within\na virtual 3D environment. Main results. We find that workload buildup in a BAT\ncan be successfully decoded from oscillatory features in the\nelectroencephalogram (EEG). Information in delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma\nspectral bands of the EEG all contribute to successful decoding, however gamma\nband activity with a lateralized somatosensory topography has the highest\ncontribution, while theta band activity with a frontocentral topography has the\nmost robust contribution in terms of real world usability. We show that the\noutput of the spectral decoder can be used to predict PIO susceptibility. We\nalso find that workload buildup in the task induces pupil dilation, the\nmagnitude of which is significantly correlated with the magnitude of the\ndecoded EEG signals. These results suggest that PIOs may result from the\ndysregulation of cortical networks such as the locus coeruleus (LC) anterior\ncingulate cortex (ACC) circuit. Significance. Our findings may generalize to\nsimilar control failures in other cases of tight man machine coupling where\ngains and latencies in the control system must be inferred and compensated for\nby the human operators. A closed-loop intervention using neurophysiological\ndecoding of workload buildup that targets the LC ACC circuit may positively\nimpact operator performance in such situations.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01784v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'A theoretical approach to understand spatial organization in complex\n  ecologies', ['Ahmed Roman', 'Debanjan Dasgupta', 'Michel Pleimling'], u'2016-05-06', u'Predicting the fate of ecologies is a daunting, albeit extremely important,\ntask. As part of this task one needs to develop an understanding of the\norganization, hierarchies, and correlations among the species forming the\necology. Focusing on complex food networks we present a theoretical method that\nallows to achieve this understanding. Starting from the adjacency matrix the\nmethod derives specific matrices that encode the various inter-species\nrelationships. The full potential of the method is achieved in a spatial\nsetting where one obtains detailed predictions for the emerging space-time\npatterns. For a variety of cases these theoretical predictions are verified\nthrough numerical simulations.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02028v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Random patterns in fish schooling enhance alertness: a hydrodynamic\n  perspective', ['Usama Kadri', 'Franz Brummer', 'Anan Kadri'], u'2016-05-05', u'One of the most highly debated questions in the field of animal swarming and\nsocial behaviour, is the collective random patterns and chaotic behaviour\nformed by some animal species, in particular if there is a danger. Is such a\nbehaviour beneficial or unfavourable for survival? Here we report on one of the\nmost remarkable forms of animal swarming and social behaviour - fish schooling\n- from a hydrodynamic point of view. We found that some fish species do not\nhave preferred orientation and they swarm in a random pattern mode, despite the\nexcess of energy consumed. Our analyses, which includes calculations of the\nhydrodynamic forces between slender bodies, show that such a behaviour enhances\nthe transfer of hydrodynamic information, and thus enhances the survivability\nof the school. These findings support the general hypothesis that a disordered\nand non-trivial collective behaviour of individuals within a nonlinear\ndynamical system is essential for optimising transfer of information - an\noptimisation that might be crucial for survival.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01973v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Metric dynamics for membrane transformation through regulated cell\n  proliferation', ['Hiroshi C. Ito'], u'2016-05-06', u'This study develops an equation for describing three-dimensional membrane\ntransformation through proliferation of its component cells regulated by\nmorphogen density distributions on the membrane. The equation is developed in a\ntwo-dimensional coordinate system mapped on the membrane, referred to as the\nmembrane coordinates. When the membrane expands, the membrane coordinates\nexpand in the same manner so that the membrane is invariant in the coordinates.\nIn the membrane coordinate system, the transformation of membrane is described\nwith a time-derivative equation for metric tensors. By defining relationships\nbetween morphogen density distributions and the direction and rate of cell\ndivision, trajectories of membrane transformation are obtained in terms of the\nmorphogen distributions. An example of the membrane transformation is shown\nnumerically.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01893v1', ['Other'], []]
[u'Deformably Registering and Annotating Whole CLARITY Brains to an Atlas\n  via Masked LDDMM', ['Kwame S. Kutten', 'Joshua T. Vogelstein', 'Nicolas Charon', 'Li Ye', 'Karl Deisseroth', 'Michael I. Miller'], u'2016-05-06', u"The CLARITY method renders brains optically transparent to enable\nhigh-resolution imaging in the structurally intact brain. Anatomically\nannotating CLARITY brains is necessary for discovering which regions contain\nsignals of interest. Manually annotating whole-brain, terabyte CLARITY images\nis difficult, time-consuming, subjective, and error-prone. Automatically\nregistering CLARITY images to a pre-annotated brain atlas offers a solution,\nbut is difficult for several reasons. Removal of the brain from the skull and\nsubsequent storage and processing cause variable non-rigid deformations, thus\ncompounding inter-subject anatomical variability. Additionally, the signal in\nCLARITY images arises from various biochemical contrast agents which only\nsparsely label brain structures. This sparse labeling challenges the most\ncommonly used registration algorithms that need to match image histogram\nstatistics to the more densely labeled histological brain atlases. The standard\nmethod is a multiscale Mutual Information B-spline algorithm that dynamically\ngenerates an average template as an intermediate registration target. We\ndetermined that this method performs poorly when registering CLARITY brains to\nthe Allen Institute's Mouse Reference Atlas (ARA), because the image histogram\nstatistics are poorly matched. Therefore, we developed a method (Mask-LDDMM)\nfor registering CLARITY images, that automatically find the brain boundary and\nlearns the optimal deformation between the brain and atlas masks. Using\nMask-LDDMM without an average template provided better results than the\nstandard approach when registering CLARITY brains to the ARA. The LDDMM\npipelines developed here provide a fast automated way to anatomically annotate\nCLARITY images.

[u'DeepPicker: a Deep Learning Approach for Fully Automated Particle\n  Picking in Cryo-EM', ['Feng Wang', 'Huichao Gong', 'Gaochao liu', 'Meijing Li', 'Chuangye Yan', 'Tian Xia', 'Xueming Li', 'Jianyang Zeng'], u'2016-05-06', u'Particle picking is a time-consuming step in single-particle analysis and\noften requires significant interventions from users, which has become a\nbottleneck for future automated electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM). Here we\nreport a deep learning framework, called DeepPicker, to address this problem\nand fill the current gaps toward a fully automated cryo-EM pipeline. DeepPicker\nemploys a novel cross-molecule training strategy to capture common features of\nparticles from previously-analyzed micrographs, and thus does not require any\nhuman intervention during particle picking. Tests on the recently-published\ncryo-EM data of three complexes have demonstrated that our deep learning based\nscheme can successfully accomplish the human-level particle picking process and\nidentify a sufficient number of particles that are comparable to those manually\nby human experts. These results indicate that DeepPicker can provide a\npractically useful tool to significantly reduce the time and manual effort\nspent in single-particle analysis and thus greatly facilitate high-resolution\ncryo-EM structure determination.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01838v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Partial DNA Assembly: A Rate-Distortion Perspective', ['Ilan Shomorony', 'Govinda M. Kamath', 'Fei Xia', 'Thomas A. Courtade', 'David N. Tse'], u'2016-05-06', u'Earlier formulations of the DNA assembly problem were all in the context of\nperfect assembly; i.e., given a set of reads from a long genome sequence, is it\npossible to perfectly reconstruct the original sequence? In practice, however,\nit is very often the case that the read data is not sufficiently rich to permit\nunambiguous reconstruction of the original sequence. While a natural\ngeneralization of the perfect assembly formulation to these cases would be to\nconsider a rate-distortion framework, partial assemblies are usually\nrepresented in terms of an assembly graph, making the definition of a\ndistortion measure challenging. In this work, we introduce a distortion\nfunction for assembly graphs that can be understood as the logarithm of the\nnumber of Eulerian cycles in the assembly graph, each of which correspond to a\ncandidate assembly that could have generated the observed reads. We also\nintroduce an algorithm for the construction of an assembly graph and analyze\nits performance on real genomes.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01941v1', ['Genomics'], []]
