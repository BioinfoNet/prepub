[u'Global analysis of VHHs framework regions with a structural alphabet', ['Floriane Noel', 'Alain Malpertuy', 'Alexandre De Brevern'], u'2016-10-05', u'The VHHs are antigen-binding region/domain of camelid heavy chain antibodies\n(HCAb). They have many interesting biotechnological and biomedical properties\ndue to their small size, high solubility and stability, and high affinity and\nspecificity for their antigens. HCAb and classical IgGs are evolutionary\nrelated and share a common fold. VHHs are composed of regions considered as\nconstant, called the frameworks (FRs) connected by Complementarity Determining\nRegions (CDRs), a highly variable region that provide interaction with the\nepitope. Actually, no systematic structural analyses had been performed on VHH\nstructures despite a significant number of structures. This work is the first\nstudy to analyse the structural diversity of FRs of VHHs. Using a structural\nalphabet that allows approximating the local conformation, we show that each of\nthe four FRs do not have a unique structure but exhibit many structural variant\npatterns. Moreover, no direct simple link between the local conformational\nchange and amino acid composition can be detected. These results indicate that\nlong-range interactions affect the local conformation of FRs and impact the\nbuilding of structural models.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01391v1', ['Biomolecules', 'Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Tuning Multiple Motor Travel Via Single Motor Velocity', ['Jing Xu', 'Zhanyong Shu', 'Stephen J. King', 'Steven P. Gross'], u'2016-10-04', u'Microtubule-based molecular motors often work in small groups to transport\ncargos in cells. A key question in understanding transport (and its regulation\nin vivo) is to identify the sensitivity of multiple-motor-based motion to\nvarious single molecule properties. Whereas both single-motor travel distance\nand microtubule binding rate have been demonstrated to contribute to cargo\ntravel, the role of single-motor velocity is yet to be explored. Here, we\nrecast a previous theoretical study, and make explicit a potential contribution\nof velocity to cargo travel. We test this possibility experimentally, and\ndemonstrate a strong negative correlation between single-motor velocity and\ncargo travel for transport driven by two motors. Our study thus discovers a\npreviously unappreciated role of single-motor velocity in regulating\nmultiple-motor transport.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01196v1', ['Biomolecules', 'Subcellular Processes'], []]

Here we report the unambiguous upregulation of multiple-kinesin travel\ndistance despite the presence of tau, via decreased single-kinesin velocity.\nInterestingly, the presence of tau also modestly reduced cargo velocity in\nmultiple-kinesin transport, and our stochastic simulations indicate that the\ntau-mediated reduction in single-kinesin travel underlies this observation.\nTaken together, our observations highlight a nontrivial interplay between\nvelocity and travel distance for kinesin transport, and suggest that\nsingle-kinesin velocity is a promising experimental handle for tuning the\neffect of tau on multiple-kinesin travel distance.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01193v1', ['Biomolecules', 'Subcellular Processes'], []]
[u'Microtubule Defects Influence Kinesin-Based Transport In Vitro', ['Winnie H. Liang', 'Qiaochu Li', 'K. M. Rifat Faysal', 'Stephen J. King', 'Ajay Gopinathan', 'Jing Xu'], u'2016-10-04', u'Microtubules are protein polymers that form "molecular highways" for\nlong-range transport within living cells. Molecular motors actively step along\nmicrotubules to shuttle cellular materials between the nucleus and the cell\nperiphery; this transport is critical for the survival and health of all\neukaryotic cells. Structural defects in microtubules exist, but whether these\ndefects impact molecular motor-based transport remains unknown. Here, we report\na new, to our knowledge, approach that allowed us to directly investigate the\nimpact of such defects. Using a modified optical-trapping method, we examined\nthe group function of a major molecular motor, conventional kinesin, when\ntransporting cargos along individual microtubules. We found that microtubule\ndefects influence kinesin-based transport in vitro. The effects depend on motor\nnumber: cargos driven by a few motors tended to unbind prematurely from the\nmicrotubule, whereas cargos driven by more motors tended to pause. To our\nknowledge, our study provides the first direct link between microtubule defects\nand kinesin function. The effects uncovered in our study may have physiological\nrelevance in vivo.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01192v1', ['Biomolecules', 'Subcellular Processes'], []]
[u'Quantitative Determination of the Probability of Multiple-Motor\n  Transport in Bead-Based Assays', ['Qiaochu Li', 'Stephen J. King', 'Ajay Gopinathan', 'Jing Xu'], u'2016-10-04', u'With their longest dimension typically being less than 100 nm, molecular\nmotors are significantly below the optical-resolution limit. Despite\nsubstantial advances in fluorescence-based imaging methodologies, labeling with\nbeads remains critical for optical-trapping-based investigations of molecular\nmotors. A key experimental challenge in bead-based assays is that the number of\nmotors on a bead is not well defined. Particularly for single-molecule\ninvestigations, the probability of single versus multiple-motor events has not\nbeen experimentally investigated. Here, we used bead travel distance as an\nindicator of multiple-motor transport and determined the lower-bound\nprobability of bead transport by two or more motors. We limited the ATP\nconcentration to increase our detection sensitivity for multiple- versus\nsingle-kinesin transport. Surprisingly, for all but the lowest motor number\nexamined, our measurements exceeded estimations of a previous model by R2-fold.\nTo bridge this apparent gap between theory and experiment, we derived a\nclosed-form expression for the probability of bead transport by multiple\nmotors, and constrained the only free parameter in this model using our\nexperimental measurements. Our data indicate that kinesin extends to ~57 nm\nduring bead transport, suggesting that kinesin exploits its conformational\nflexibility to interact with microtubules at highly curved interfaces such as\nthose present for vesicle transport in cells. To our knowledge, our findings\nprovide the first experimentally constrained guide for estimating the\nprobability of multiple-motor transport in optical trapping studies. The\nexperimental approach utilized here (limiting ATP concentration) may be\ngenerally applicable to studies in which molecular motors are labeled with\ncargos that are artificial or are purified from cellular extracts.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01189v1', ['Biomolecules', 'Quantitative Methods', 'Subcellular Processes'], []]
[u'DeepGaze II: Reading fixations from deep features trained on object\n  recognition', ['Matthias Kummerer', 'Thomas S. A. Wallis', 'Matthias Bethge'], u'2016-10-05', u'Here we present DeepGaze II, a model that predicts where people look in\nimages. The model uses the features from the VGG-19 deep neural network trained\nto identify objects in images. Contrary to other saliency models that use deep\nfeatures, here we use the VGG features for saliency prediction with no\nadditional fine-tuning (rather, a few readout layers are trained on top of the\nVGG features to predict saliency). The model is therefore a strong test of\ntransfer learning. After conservative cross-validation, DeepGaze II explains\nabout 87% of the explainable information gain in the patterns of fixations and\nachieves top performance in area under the curve metrics on the MIT300 hold-out\nbenchmark. These results corroborate the finding from DeepGaze I (which\nexplained 56% of the explainable information gain), that deep features trained\non object recognition provide a versatile feature space for performing related\nvisual tasks. We explore the factors that contribute to this success and\npresent several informative image examples.

[u'New hallmarks of criticality in recurrent neural networks', ['Yahya Karimipanah', 'Zhengyu Ma', 'Ralf Wessel'], u'2016-10-04', u'A rigorous understanding of brain dynamics and function requires a conceptual\nbridge between multiple levels of organization, including neural spiking and\nnetwork-level population activity. Mounting evidence suggests that neural\nnetworks of cerebral cortex operate at criticality. How operating near this\nnetwork state impacts the variability of neuronal spiking is largely unknown.\nHere we show in a computational model that two prevalent features of cortical\nsingle-neuron activity, irregular spiking and the decline of response\nvariability at stimulus onset, are both emergent properties of a recurrent\nnetwork operating near criticality. Importantly, our work reveals that the\nrelation between the irregularity of spiking and the number of input\nconnections to a neuron, i.e., the in-degree, is maximized at criticality. Our\nfindings establish criticality as a unifying principle for the variability of\nsingle-neuron spiking and the collective behavior of recurrent circuits in\ncerebral cortex.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01217v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

[u'Bifurcation analysis and global dynamics of a mathematical model of\n  antibiotic resistance in hospitals', ['Xiuli Cen', 'Zhilan Feng', 'Yiqiang Zheng', 'Yulin Zhao'], u'2016-09-27', u'Antibiotic-resistant bacteria has posed a grave threat to public health by\ncausing a number of nosocomial infections in hospitals. Mathematical models\nhave been used to study the transmission of antibiotic-resistant bacteria\nwithin a hospital and the measures to control antibiotic resistance in\nnosocomial pathogens. Studies presented in \\cite{LBL,LB} have shown great value\nin understanding the transmission of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in a\nhospital. However, their results are limited to numerical simulations of a few\ndifferent scenarios without analytical analysis of the models in all\nbiologically feasible parameter regions. Bifurcation analysis and\nidentification of the global stability conditions are necessary to assess the\ninterventions which are proposed to limit nosocomial infection and stem the\nspread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. In this paper we study the global\ndynamics of the mathematical model of antibiotic resistance in hospitals in\n\\cite{LBL,LB}. The invasion reproduction number $\\mathcal R_{ar}$ of\nantibiotic-resistant bacteria is introduced. We give the relationship of\n$\\mathcal R_{ar}$ and two control reproduction numbers of sensitive bacteria\nand resistant bacteria ($\\mathcal R_{sc}$ and $\\mathcal R_{rc}$). More\nimportantly, we prove that a backward bifurcation may occur at $\\mathcal\nR_{ar}=1$ when the model includes superinfection which is not mentioned in\n\\cite{LB}. That is, there exists a new threshold $\\mathcal R_{ar}^c$, and if\n$\\mathcal R_{ar}^c<\\mathcal R_{ar}<1$, then the system can have two interior\nequilibria and it supports an interesting bistable phenomenon. This provides\ncritical information on controlling the antibiotic-resistance in a hospital.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01446v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
