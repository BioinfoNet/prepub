[u'Leaders and followers: Quantifying consistency in spatio-temporal\n  propagation patterns', ['Thomas Kreuz', 'Eero Satuvuori', 'Martin Pofahl', 'Mario Mulansky'], u'2016-10-25', u'Repetitive spatio-temporal propagation patterns are encountered in fields as\nwide-ranging as climatology, social communication and network science. In\nneuroscience, perfectly consistent repetitions of the same global propagation\npattern are called a synfire pattern. For any recording of sequences of\ndiscrete events (in neuroscience terminology: sets of spike trains) the\nquestions arise how closely it resembles such a synfire pattern and which are\nthe spike trains that lead/follow. Here we address these questions and\nintroduce an algorithm built on two new indicators, termed SPIKE-Order and\nSpike Train Order, that define the Synfire Indicator value, which allows to\nsort multiple spike trains from leader to follower and to quantify the\nconsistency of the temporal leader-follower relationships for both the original\nand the optimized sorting. We demonstrate our new approach using artificially\ngenerated datasets before we apply it to analyze the consistency of propagation\npatterns in two real datasets from neuroscience (Giant Depolarized Potentials\nin mice slices) and climatology (El Ni~no sea surface temperature recordings).\nThe new algorithm is distinguished by conceptual and practical simplicity, low\ncomputational cost, as well as flexibility and universality.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.07986v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Bi-phase age-related brain gray matter magnetic resonance T1rho\n  relaxation time change', ['Yao T Li', 'Huang Hua', 'Zhizheng Zhang', 'Puxuan Lu', 'Weitian Chen', 'Yixiang J Wang'], u'2016-10-25', u'Objectives: To investigate normative value and age-related change of brain\nmagnetic resonance T1rho relaxation at 1.5 T. Methods: 20 males (age:\n40.7+/-15.5 years, range: 22-68 years) and 22 females (age: 38.5 +/-14.8 years,\nrange: 21-62 years), were scanned at 1.5 Tesla using 3D fluid suppressed turbo\nspin echo sequence. Regions-of-interests (ROIs) were obtained by atlas-based\ntissue segmentation and T1rho was calculated by fitting the mean value to\nmonoexponential model. Correlation between T1rho relaxation of brain gray\nmatter regions and age was investigated. Results: A regional difference among\nindividual gray matter areas was noted; with hippocampus (98.37+/-5.37 msec)\nand amygdala (94.95+/-4.34 msec) have the highest measurement, while pallidum\n(83.81+/-5.49) and putamen (83.93+4.76) the lowest measurement. T1rho values\ndecreased slowly (mean slope: -0.256) and significantly (p<0.05) with age in\ngray matter for subjects younger than 40 years old, while for subjects older\nthan 40 years old there was no significant correlation between T1rho relaxation\nand age. Conclusion: T1rho relaxation demonstrates a bi-phase change with age\nin adults of 22-68 years.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.07769v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Exact probabilities for the indeterminacy of complex networks as\n  perceived through press perturbations', ['David Koslicki', 'Mark Novak'], u'2016-10-25', u"We consider the goal of predicting how complex networks respond to chronic\n(press) perturbations when characterizations of their network topology and\ninteraction strengths are associated with uncertainty. Our primary result is\nthe derivation of exact formulas for the expected number and probability of\nqualitatively incorrect predictions about a system's responses under\nuncertainties drawn form arbitrary distributions of error. These formulas\nobviate the current use of simulations, algorithms, and qualitative modeling\ntechniques. Additional indices provide new tools for identifying which links in\na network are most qualitatively and quantitatively sensitive to error, and for\ndetermining the volume of errors within which predictions will remain\nqualitatively determinate (i.e. sign insensitive). Together with recent\nadvances in the empirical characterization of uncertainty in ecological\nnetworks, these tools bridge a way towards probabilistic predictions of network\ndynamics.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.07705v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Robustness of flight leadership relations in pigeons', ['Andrea Flack', 'Zsuzsa Akos', 'Mate Nagy', 'Tamas Vicsek', 'Dora Biro'], u'2016-10-25', u"Collective animal movements produce spectacular natural phenomena that arise\nfrom simple local interactions among group members. Flocks of homing pigeons,\nColumba livia, provide a useful model for the study of collective motion and\ndecision making. During homing flights, flock members are forced to resolve\npotentially divergent navigational preferences in order to stay together and\nbenefit from flying in a group. Recent work has demonstrated that some\nindividuals consistently contribute more to the movement decisions of the flock\nthan others do, thereby generating stable hierarchical leader/follower\nnetworks. Yet, what attributes of a flying pigeon reliably predict leadership\nremains an open question. We examined the flexibility of an individual's\nhierarchical leadership rank (i.e. its ordinal position when flock members are\nranked according to the average time differences with which they lead or follow\nothers) as a function of changes in its navigational knowledge. We manipulated\nalready established hierarchical networks in three different flocks, by\nproviding certain individuals with additional homing experience. We found that\nsuch training did not consistently lead to an increase in birds' leadership\nranks, and that, in general, the nature of leader/follower interactions between\ntrained and untrained birds remained unaffected. Thus, leadership hierarchies\nin pigeon flocks appear resistant to changes in the navigational knowledge of a\nsubset of their members, at least when these changes are relatively small. We\ndiscuss the implications of our results in light of the potential benefits of\nstructural stability in decision-making networks.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.07784v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]

Materials and Methods: In total 19\nhealth subjects (10 males, 9 females; mean age: 37.4 yrs; range: 23-54 yrs)\nparticipated in the study. 11 subjects had liver scanned twice in the same\nsession to access scan-rescan repeatability. 12 subjects had liver scanned\ntwice in two sessions with 7-10 days' interval to access scan-rescan\nreproducibility. MR was performed with a 3.0 T scanner with dual transmitter.\nThe MR sequence allows simultaneous acquisition of 4 spin lock times (TSLs:\n0ms, 10 ms, 30 ms, 50ms) in 10 second. Inherent black blood effect of fast spin\necho and double inversion recovery were utilized to achieve blood signal\nsuppression. Results: The technique demonstrated good image quality and minimal\nartifacts. For liver parenchyma, Bland-Altman plot showed the scan-rescan\nrepeatability mean difference was 0.025 ms (95% limits of agreement: -1.163 to\n1.213 ms), and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was 0.977. The\nscan-rescan reproducibility mean difference was -0.075 ms (95% limits of\nagreement: -3.280 to 3.310 ms), and ICC was 0.820 which is better than the ICC\nof 0.764 of a previous bright blood multi-breath hold gradient echo acquisition\ntechnique. The liver T1rho value was 39.9 +/- 2.4 ms (range: 36.1 - 44.2 ms),\nwhich is lower than the value of 42.8=/-2.1 ms acquired with the previous\nbright blood technique. Conclusion: This study validated the application of a\nsingle breathhold black blood single shot fast spin echo acquisition based for\nhuman liver T1rho imaging. The lower liver parenchyma T1rho value and higher\nscan rescan reproducibility may improve of the sensitivity of this technique.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.07767v1', ['Tissues and Organs'], []]
[u'Recovering Metabolic Networks using A Novel Hyperlink Prediction Method', ['Muhan Zhang', 'Zhicheng Cui', 'Tolutola Oyetunde', 'Yinjie Tang', 'Yixin Chen'], u'2016-10-21', u'Studying metabolic networks is vital for many areas such as novel drugs and\nbio-fuels. For biologists, a key challenge is that many reactions are\nimpractical or expensive to be found through experiments. Our task is to\nrecover the missing reactions. By exploiting the problem structure, we model\nreaction recovery as a hyperlink prediction problem, where each reaction is\nregarded as a hyperlink connecting its participating vertices (metabolites).\nDifferent from the traditional link prediction problem where two nodes form a\nlink, a hyperlink can involve an arbitrary number of nodes. Since the\ncardinality of a hyperlink is variable, existing classifiers based on a fixed\nnumber of input features become infeasible. Traditional methods, such as common\nneighbors and Katz index, are not applicable either, since they are restricted\nto pairwise similarities. In this paper, we propose a novel hyperlink\nprediction algorithm, called Matrix Boosting (MATBoost). MATBoost conducts\ninference jointly in the incidence space and adjacency space by performing an\niterative completion-matching optimization. We carry out extensive experiments\nto show that MATBoost achieves state-of-the-art performance. For a metabolic\nnetwork with 1805 metabolites and 2583 reactions, our algorithm can\nsuccessfully recover nearly 200 reactions out of 400 missing reactions.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06941v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]

In analogy with these systems, the\ndistribution of activity bursts displays scaling laws that are universal in\ndifferent cell types and for cells moving on different substrates.
