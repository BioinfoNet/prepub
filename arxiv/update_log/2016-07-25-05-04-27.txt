[u'Gerbil: A Fast and Memory-Efficient $k$-mer Counter with GPU-Support', ['Marius Erbert', 'Steffen Rechner', 'Matthias Muller-Hannemann'], u'2016-07-22', u'A basic task in bioinformatics is the counting of $k$-mers in genome strings.\nThe $k$-mer counting problem is to build a histogram of all substrings of\nlength $k$ in a given genome sequence. We present the open source $k$-mer\ncounting software Gerbil that has been designed for the efficient counting of\n$k$-mers for $k\\geq32$. Given the technology trend towards long reads of\nnext-generation sequencers, support for large $k$ becomes increasingly\nimportant. While existing $k$-mer counting tools suffer from excessive memory\nresource consumption or degrading performance for large $k$, Gerbil is able to\nefficiently support large $k$ without much loss of performance. Our software\nimplements a two-disk approach. In the first step, DNA reads are loaded from\ndisk and distributed to temporary files that are stored at a working disk. In a\nsecond step, the temporary files are read again, split into $k$-mers and\ncounted via a hash table approach. In addition, Gerbil can optionally use GPUs\nto accelerate the counting step. For large $k$, we outperform state-of-the-art\nopen source $k$-mer counting tools for large genome data sets.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06618v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Ephemeral protein binding to DNA shapes stable nuclear bodies and\n  chromatin domains', ['C. A. Brackley', 'B. Liebchen', 'D. Michieletto', 'F. Mouvet', 'P. R. Cook', 'D. Marenduzzo'], u'2016-07-22', u'Fluorescence microscopy reveals that the contents of many (membrane-free)\nnuclear "bodies" exchange rapidly with the soluble pool whilst the underlying\nstructure persists; such observations await a satisfactory biophysical\nexplanation. To shed light on this, we perform large-scale Brownian dynamics\nsimulations of a chromatin fiber interacting with an ensemble of (multivalent)\nDNA-binding proteins; these proteins switch between two states -- active\n(binding) and inactive (non-binding). This system provides a model for any\nDNA-binding protein that can be modified post-translationally to change its\naffinity for DNA (e.g., like the phosphorylation of a transcription factor).\nDue to this out-of-equilibrium process, proteins spontaneously assemble into\nclusters of self-limiting size, as individual proteins in a cluster exchange\nwith the soluble pool with kinetics like those seen in photo-bleaching\nexperiments. This behavior contrasts sharply with that exhibited by\n"equilibrium", or non-switching, proteins that exist only in the binding state;\nwhen these bind to DNA non-specifically, they form clusters that grow\nindefinitely in size. Our results point to post-translational modification of\nchromatin-bridging proteins as a generic mechanism driving the self-assembly of\nhighly dynamic, non-equilibrium, protein clusters with the properties of\nnuclear bodies. Such active modification also reshapes intra-chromatin contacts\nto give networks resembling those seen in topologically-associating domains, as\nswitching markedly favors local (short-range) contacts over distant ones.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06640v1', ['Subcellular Processes'], []]
