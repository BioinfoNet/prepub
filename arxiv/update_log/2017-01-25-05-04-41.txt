[u'Stability of casein micelles cross-linked with genipin: a physicochemical study as a function of pH', ['Federico Casanova', 'Naaman F. Nogueira Silva', 'Frederic Gaucheron', 'Marcio H. Nogueira', 'Alvaro V. N. C. Teixeira', 'Italo Tuler Perrone', 'Maura Pinhero Alves', 'Priscila Cardoso Fidelis', 'Antonio F. de Carvalho'], u'2017-01-20', u'Chemical or enzymatic cross-linking of casein micelles (CMs) increases their stability against dissociating agents. In this paper, a comparative study of stability between native CMs and CMs cross-linked with genipin (CMs-GP) as a function of pH is described. Stability to temperature and ethanol were investigated in the pH range 2.0-7.0. The size and the charge ($\\zeta$-potential) of the particles were determined by dynamic light scattering. Native CMs precipitated below pH 5.5, CMs-GP precipitated from pH 3.5 to 4.5, whereas no precipitation was observed at pH 2.0-3.0 or pH 4.5-7.0. The isoelectric point of CMs-GP was determined to be pH 3.7. Highest stability against heat and ethanol was observed for CMs-GP at pH 2, where visible coagulation was determined only after 800 s at 140 $^\\circ$C or 87.5% (v/v) of ethanol. These results confirmed the hypothesis that cross-linking by GP increased the stability of CMs.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06638v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Sparse models for Computer Vision', ['Laurent Perrinet'], u'2017-01-24', u'The representation of images in the brain is known to be sparse. That is, as neural activity is recorded in a visual area ---for instance the primary visual cortex of primates--- only a few neurons are active at a given time with respect to the whole population. It is believed that such a property reflects the efficient match of the representation with the statistics of natural scenes. Applying such a paradigm to computer vision therefore seems a promising approach towards more biomimetic algorithms. Herein, we will describe a biologically-inspired approach to this problem. First, we will describe an unsupervised learning paradigm which is particularly adapted to the efficient coding of image patches. Then, we will outline a complete multi-scale framework ---SparseLets--- implementing a biologically inspired sparse representation of natural images. Finally, we will propose novel methods for integrating prior information into these algorithms and provide some preliminary experimental results. We will conclude by giving some perspective on applying such algorithms to computer vision. More specifically, we will propose that bio-inspired approaches may be applied to computer vision using predictive coding schemes, sparse models being one simple and efficient instance of such schemes.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06859v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], [u'INT']]
[u'Identifiability and Reconstructibility of Species Phylogenies Under a Modified Coalescent', ['Colby Long', 'Laura Kubatko'], u'2017-01-24', u'Coalescent models of evolution account for incomplete lineage sorting by specifying a species tree parameter which determines a distribution on gene trees. It has been shown that the unrooted topology of the species tree parameter of the multispecies coalescent is generically identifiable. Moreover, a statistically consistent reconstruction method called SVDQuartets has been developed to recover this parameter. In this paper, we describe a modified multispecies coalescent model that allows for varying effective population size and violations of the molecular clock. We show that the unrooted topology of the species tree for these models is generically identifiable and that SVDQuartets is still a statistically consistent method for inferring this parameter.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06871v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Optimal interdependence enhances robustness of complex systems', ['R. K. Singh', 'Sitabhra Sinha'], u'2017-01-24', u'While interdependent systems have usually been associated with increased fragility, we show that strengthening the interdependence between dynamical processes on different networks can make them more robust. By coupling the dynamics of networks that in isolation exhibit catastrophic collapse with extinction of nodal activity, we demonstrate system-wide persistence of activity for an optimal range of interdependence between the networks. This is related to the appearance of attractors of the global dynamics comprising disjoint sets ("islands") of stable activity.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06730v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Evolutionary games on cycles with strong selection', ['Philipp M. Altrock', 'Arne Traulsen', 'Martin A. Nowak'], u'2017-01-23', u'Evolutionary games on graphs describe how strategic interactions and population structure determine evolutionary success, quantified by the probability that a single mutant takes over a population. Graph structures, compared to the well-mixed case, can act as amplifiers or suppressors of selection by increasing or decreasing the fixation probability of a beneficial mutant. Properties of the associated mean fixation times can be more intricate, especially when selection is strong. The intuition is that fixation of a beneficial mutant happens fast (in a dominance game), that fixation takes very long (in a coexistence game), and that strong selection eliminates demographic noise. Here we show that these intuitions can be misleading in structured populations. We analyze mean fixation times on the cycle graph under strong frequency-dependent selection for two different microscopic evolutionary update rules (death-birth and birth-death). We establish exact analytical results for fixation times under strong selection, and show that there are coexistence games in which fixation occurs in time polynomial in population size. Depending on the underlying game, we observe inherence of demographic noise even under strong selection, if the process is driven by random death before selection for birth of an offspring (death-birth update). In contrast, if selection for an offspring occurs before random removal (birth-death update), strong selection can remove demographic noise almost entirely.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06615v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

[u'Comparable variable selection with Lasso', ['Lingfei Wang', 'Tom Michoel'], u'2017-01-24', u'P-values are being computed for increasingly complicated statistics but lacking evaluations on their quality. Meanwhile, accurate p-values enable significance comparison across batches of hypothesis tests and consequently unified false discover rate (FDR) control. This article discusses two related questions in this setting. First, we propose statistical tests to evaluate the quality of p-value and the cross-batch comparability of any other statistic. Second, we propose a lasso based variable selection statistic, based on when the predictor variable first becomes active, and compute its p-value to achieve unified FDR control across multiple selections. In the end, we apply our tests on covTest, selectiveInference, and our statistic, based on real and null datasets for network inference in normal and high-dimensional settings. Results demonstrate higher p-value quality from our statistic and reveal p-value errors from others hidden before. We implement our statistic as lassopv in R.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07011v1', ['Quantitative Methods', 'Molecular Networks'], []]
[u'Dynamic Mortality Risk Predictions in Pediatric Critical Care Using Recurrent Neural Networks', ['M Aczon', 'D Ledbetter', 'L Ho', 'A Gunny', 'A Flynn', 'J Williams', 'R Wetzel'], u'2017-01-23', u"Viewing the trajectory of a patient as a dynamical system, a recurrent neural network was developed to learn the course of patient encounters in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) of a major tertiary care center. Data extracted from Electronic Medical Records (EMR) of about 12000 patients who were admitted to the PICU over a period of more than 10 years were leveraged. The RNN model ingests a sequence of measurements which include physiologic observations, laboratory results, administered drugs and interventions, and generates temporally dynamic predictions for in-ICU mortality at user-specified times. The RNN's ICU mortality predictions offer significant improvements over those from two clinically-used scores and static machine learning algorithms.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06675v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Microenvironmental cooperation promotes early spread and bistability of a Warburg-like phenotype', ['Jorge Fernandez-de-Cossio-Diaz', 'Andrea De Martino', 'Roberto Mulet'], u'2017-01-24', u'We introduce an in silico model for the initial spread of an aberrant phenotype with Warburg-like overflow metabolism within a healthy homeostatic tissue in contact with a nutrient reservoir (the blood), aimed at characterizing the role of the microenvironment for aberrant growth. Accounting for cellular metabolic activity, competition for nutrients, spatial diffusion and their feedbacks on aberrant replication and death rates, we obtain a phase portrait where distinct asymptotic whole-tissue states are found upon varying the tissue-blood turnover rate and the level of blood-borne primary nutrient. Over a broad range of parameters, the spreading dynamics is bistable as random fluctuations can impact the final state of the tissue. Such a behaviour turns out to be linked to the re-cycling of overflow products by non-aberrant cells. Quantitative insight on the overall emerging picture is provided by a spatially homogeneous version of the model.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06781v1', ['Tissues and Organs', 'Molecular Networks'], []]
[u'A multiphase Cahn-Hilliard-Darcy model for tumour growth with necrosis', ['Harald Garcke', 'Kei Fong Lam', 'Robert Nurnberg', 'Emanuel Sitka'], u'2017-01-23', u'We derive a Cahn-Hilliard-Darcy model to describe multiphase tumour growth taking interactions with multiple chemical species into account as well as the simultaneous occurrence of proliferating, quiescent and necrotic regions. Via a coupling of the Cahn-Hilliard-Darcy equations to a system of reaction-diffusion equations a multitude of phenomena such as nutrient diffusion and consumption, angiogenesis, hypoxia, blood vessel growth, and inhibition by toxic agents, which are released for example by the necrotic cells, can be included. A new feature of the modelling approach is that a volume-averaged velocity is used, which dramatically simplifies the resulting equations. With the help of formally matched asymptotic analysis we develop new sharp interface models. Finite element numerical computations are performed and in particular the effects of necrosis on tumour growth is investigated numerically.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06656v1', ['Tissues and Organs'], []]
[u'Design Principles of Length Control of Cytoskeletal Structures', ['Lishibanya Mohapatra', 'Bruce L. Goode', 'Predrag Jelenkovic', 'Rob Phillips', 'Jane Kondev'], u'2017-01-19', u'Cells contain elaborate and interconnected networks of protein polymers which make up the cytoskeleton. The cytoskeleton governs the internal positioning and movement of vesicles and organelles, and controls dynamic changes in cell polarity, shape and movement. Many of these processes require tight control of the size and shape of cytoskeletal structures, which is achieved despite rapid turnover of their molecular components. Here we review mechanisms by which cells control the size of filamentous cytoskeletal structures from the point of view of simple quantitative models that take into account stochastic dynamics of their assembly and disassembly. Significantly, these models make experimentally testable predictions that distinguish different mechanisms of length-control. While the primary focus of this review is on cytoskeletal structures, we believe that the broader principles and mechanisms discussed herein will apply to a range of other subcellular structures whose sizes are tightly controlled and are linked to their functions.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.05473v1', ['Subcellular Processes'], []]
[u'A generalized linear model for decomposing genetic, parent-of-origin, and maternal effects on allele-specific gene expression', ['Yasuaki Takada', 'Ryutaro Miyagi', 'Aya Takahashi', 'Toshinori Endo', 'Naoki Osada'], u'2017-01-24', u'Joint quantification of genetic and epigenetic effects on gene expression is important for understanding the establishment of complex gene regulation systems in living organisms. In particular, genomic imprinting and maternal effects play important roles in the developmental process of mammals and flowering plants. However, the influence of these effects on gene expression are difficult to quantify because they act simultaneously with cis-regulatory mutations. Here we propose a simple method to decompose cis-regulatory mutational (i.e., allelic genotype, AG), genomic imprinting (i.e., parent-of-origin, PO), and maternal (i.e., maternal genotype, MG) effects on allele-specific gene expression using RNA-seq data obtained from reciprocal crosses. We evaluated the methodologic efficiency using a simulated dataset and applied the method to whole-body Drosophila and mouse trophoblast stem cell (TSC) and liver RNA-seq data. Consistent with previous studies, we found no evidence of PO and MG effects in adult Drosophila samples. In contrast, we identified hundreds of mouse genes with significant PO and MG effects. Interestingly, the PO effect was mostly conserved between mouse TSCs and livers, whereas the MG effect was mostly observed in livers. Further method application studies will clarify how these three effects influence gene expression levels in different tissues and developmental stages, and provide novel insight into the evolution of gene expression regulation.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06776v1', ['Genomics'], []]
