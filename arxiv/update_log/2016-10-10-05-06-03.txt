[u'Kinetics of spontaneous filament nucleation via oligomers: insights from\n  theory and simulation', ['Anela Saric', 'Thomas C. T. Michaels', 'Alessio Zaccone', 'Tuomas P. J. Knowles', 'Daan Frenkel'], u'2016-10-07', u'Nucleation processes are at the heart of a large number of phenomena, from\ncloud formation to protein crystallization. A recently emerging area where\nnucleation is highly relevant is the initiation of filamentous protein\nself-assembly, a process that has broad implications from medicine to\nnanotechnology. As such, spontaneous nucleation of protein fibrils has received\nmuch attention in recent years with many theoretical and experimental studies\nfocusing on the underlying physical principles. In this paper we make a step\nforward in this direction and explore the early time behaviour of filamentous\nprotein growth in the context of nucleation theory. We first provide an\noverview of the thermodynamics and kinetics of spontaneous nucleation in\nprotein filaments in the presence of one relevant degree of freedom, namely the\ncluster size. In this case, we review how key kinetic observables, such as the\nreaction order of spontaneous nucleation, are directly related to the physical\nsize of the critical nucleus. We then focus on the increasingly prominent case\nof filament nucleation that includes a conformational conversion of the\nnucleating building-block as an additional slow step in the nucleation process.\nUsing computer simulations, we study the concentration dependence of the\nnucleation rate. We find that, under these circumstances, the reaction order of\nspontaneous nucleation with respect to the free monomer does no longer relate\nto the overall physical size of the nucleating aggregate but rather to the\nsubset of proteins within the aggregate that actively participate in the\nconformational conversion. Our results thus provide a novel interpretation of\nthe kinetic descriptors of protein filament formation, including the reaction\norder of the nucleation step or the scaling exponent of lag times, and put into\nperspective current theoretical descriptions of protein aggregation.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02320v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]

[u'Geometric-optical illusions and Riemannian geometry', ['Werner Ehm', 'Jiri Wackermann'], u'2016-10-07', u'Geometric-optical illusions (GOI) are a subclass of a vast variety of visual\nillusions. A special class of GOIs originates from the superposition of a\nsimple geometric figure ("target") with an array of non-intersecting\ncurvilinear elements ("context") that elicits a perceptual distortion of the\ntarget element. Here we specifically deal with the case of circular targets.\nStarting from the fact that (half)circles are geodesics in a model of\nhyperbolic geometry, we conceive of the deformations of the target as resulting\nfrom a context-induced perturbation of that "base" geometry. We present\ncomputational methods for predicting distorted shapes of the target in\ndifferent contexts, and we report the results of a psychophysical pilot\nexperiment with eight subjects and four contexts to test the predictions.\nFinally, we propose a common scheme for modeling GOIs associated with more\ngeneral types of target curves, subsuming those studied previously.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02227v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Computational Tradeoffs in Biological Neural Networks: Self-Stabilizing\n  Winner-Take-All Networks', ['Nancy Lynch', 'Cameron Musco', 'Merav Parter'], u'2016-10-06', u"We initiate a line of investigation into biological neural networks from an\nalgorithmic perspective. We develop a simplified but biologically plausible\nmodel for distributed computation in stochastic spiking neural networks and\nstudy tradeoffs between computation time and network complexity in this model.\nOur aim is to abstract real neural networks in a way that, while not capturing\nall interesting features, preserves high-level behavior and allows us to make\nbiologically relevant conclusions.\n  In this paper, we focus on the important `winner-take-all' (WTA) problem,\nwhich is analogous to a neural leader election unit: a network consisting of\n$n$ input neurons and $n$ corresponding output neurons must converge to a state\nin which a single output corresponding to a firing input (the `winner') fires,\nwhile all other outputs remain silent. Neural circuits for WTA rely on\ninhibitory neurons, which suppress the activity of competing outputs and drive\nthe network towards a converged state with a single firing winner. We attempt\nto understand how the number of inhibitors used affects network convergence\ntime.\n  We show that it is possible to significantly outperform naive WTA\nconstructions through a more refined use of inhibition, solving the problem in\n$O(\\theta)$ rounds in expectation with just $O(\\log^{1/\\theta} n)$ inhibitors\nfor any $\\theta$. An alternative construction gives convergence in\n$O(\\log^{1/\\theta} n)$ rounds with $O(\\theta)$ inhibitors. We compliment these\nupper bounds with our main technical contribution, a nearly matching lower\nbound for networks using $\\ge \\log\\log n$ inhibitors. Our lower bound uses\nfamiliar indistinguishability and locality arguments from distributed computing\ntheory. It lets us derive a number of interesting conclusions about the\nstructure of any network solving WTA with good probability, and the use of\nrandomness and inhibition within such a network.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02084v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

[u'Neutral Aggregation in Finite Length Genotype space', ['Bahram Houchmandzadeh'], u'2016-10-07', u'The advent of modern genome sequencing techniques allows for a more stringent\ntest of the neutrality hypothesis of Evolution, where all individuals have the\nsame fitness. Using the individual based model of Wright and Fisher, we compute\nthe amplitude of neutral aggregation in the genome space, i.e., the probability\nPL,$\\Theta$,M (k) of finding two individuals at genetic distance k for a genome\nof size L and mutation and migration number $\\Theta$ and M. In well mixed\npopulations, we show that for $\\Theta$ $\\ll$ L, neutral aggregation is the\ndominant force and most individuals are found at short genetic distances from\neach other. For $\\Theta$ $\\sim$ L/2 on the contrary, individuals are randomly\ndispersed in genome space.

[u'Phenomenology of infant death rates. Identification of the peaks of\n  viral and bacterial diseases', ['Peter Richmond', 'Bertrand M. Roehner'], u'2016-10-07', u"After birth setting up an effective immune system is a major challenge for\nall living organisms. In this paper we show that this process can be explored\nby using the age-specific infant death rate as a kind of sensor. This is made\npossible because, as shown by the authors in Berrut et al. (2016), between\nbirth and a critical age t_c, for all mammals the death rate decreases with age\nas an hyperbolic function. For humans t_c is equal to 10 years. At some ages\nthe hyperbolic fall displays spikes which, it is assumed, correspond to\nspecific events in the organism's response to exogenous factors. One of these\nspikes occurs 10 days after birth and there is another at the age of about 300\ndays. It is shown that the first spike is related to viral infections whereas\nthe second is related to bacterial diseases. By going back to former time\nperiods during which infant mortality was much higher than currently, it is\npossible to get a magnified view of these peaks which in turn may give us\nuseful information about how an organism adapts to new conditions. Apart from\npathogens, the same methodology can be used to study the response to changes in\nother external conditions, e.g. supply of food, temperature or oxygen level.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02198v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Parallel STEPS: Large Scale Stochastic Spatial Reaction-Diffusion\n  Simulation with High Performance Computers', ['Weiliang Chen', 'Erik De Schutter'], u'2016-10-07', u'Stochastic, spatial reaction-diffusion simulations have been widely used in\nsystems biology and computational neuroscience. However, the increasing scale\nand complexity of simulated models and morphologies have exceeded the capacity\nof any serial implementation. This led to development of parallel solutions\nthat benefit from the boost in performance of modern large-scale\nsupercomputers. In this paper, we describe an MPI-based, parallel\nOperator-Splitting implementation for stochastic spatial reaction-diffusion\nsimulations with irregular tetrahedral meshes. The performance of our\nimplementation is first examined and analyzed with simulations of a simple\nmodel. We then demonstrate its usage in real-world research by simulating the\nreaction-diffusion components of a published calcium burst model in both\nPurkinje neuron sub-branch and full dendrite morphologies. Simulation results\nindicate that our implementation is capable of achieving super-linear speedup\nfor balanced loading simulations with reasonable molecule density and mesh\nquality. In the best scenario a parallel simulation with 2000 processes\nachieves more than 3600 times of speedup relative to its serial SSA counterpart\nand more than 20 times of speedup relative to parallel simulation with 100\nprocesses. While simulation performance is affected by unbalanced loading, a\nsubstantial speedup can still be observed without any special treatment.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02258v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Dynamics of suspended rigid aggregating particles in flowing medium:\n  theory, analysis and scientific computing', ['Sarthok Sircar', 'Anthony J. Roberts'], u'2016-10-06', u'We develop and present a unified multi-scale model (involving three scales of\nspatial organisation) to study the dynamics of rigid aggregating particles\nsuspended in a viscous fluid medium and subject to a steady poiseuille flow. At\nmicro-level, the theory of adhesion describing the attachment / detachment\nkinetics of two rigid spheres coated with binding ligands, is utilized to\ndescribe the collision frequency function. The meso-scale dynamics is outlined\nthrough a continuous general dynamic equation governing the time rate of change\nof the particle size distribution function. The micro-meso coupling is achieved\nvia the balancing of the mesoscale drag forces and couples with the micro-scale\nforces associated with the binder kinetics. Inside the macro domain (i.e., a\nlong pipe), the model is equation free and divided into equal sized patches.\nThe macroscale solution within each patch is obtained via appropriate\n(extrapolatory) coupling and amplitude conditions.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02100v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Formation and maintenance of nitrogen fixing cell patterns in\n  filamentous cyanobacteria', ['Javier Munoz-Garcia', 'Saul Ares'], u'2016-10-07', u'Cyanobacteria forming one-dimensional filaments are paradigmatic model\norganisms of the transition between unicellular and multicellular living forms.\nUnder nitrogen limiting conditions, in filaments of the genus Anabaena, some\ncells differentiate into heterocysts, which lose the possibility to divide but\nare able to fix environmental nitrogen for the colony. These heterocysts form a\nquasi-regular pattern in the filament, representing a prototype of patterning\nand morphogenesis in prokaryotes. Recent years have seen advances in the\nidentification of the molecular mechanism regulating this pattern. We use this\ndata to build a theory on heterocyst pattern formation, for which both genetic\nregulation and the effects of cell division and filament growth are key\ncomponents. The theory is based on the interplay of three generic mechanisms:\nlocal autoactivation, early long range inhibition, and late long range\ninhibition. These mechanisms can be identified with the dynamics of hetR, patS\nand hetN expression. Our theory reproduces quantitatively the experimental\ndynamics of pattern formation and maintenance for wild type and mutants. We\nfind that hetN alone is not enough to play the role as the late inhibitory\nmechanism: a second mechanism, hypothetically the products of nitrogen fixation\nsupplied by heterocysts, must also play a role in late long range inhibition.\nThe preponderance of even intervals between heterocysts arises naturally as a\nresult of the interplay between the timescales of genetic regulation and cell\ndivision. We also find that a purely stochastic initiation of the pattern,\nwithout a two-stage process, is enough to reproduce experimental observations.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02301v1', ['Tissues and Organs', 'Cell Behavior'], []]
[u'Mathematical modeling of local perfusion in large distensible\n  microvascular networks', ['Paola Causin', 'Francesca Malgaroli'], u'2016-09-28', u"Microvessels -blood vessels with diameter less than 200 microns- form large,\nintricate networks organized into arterioles, capillaries and venules. In these\nnetworks, the distribution of flow and pressure drop is a highly interlaced\nfunction of single vessel resistances and mutual vessel interactions. In this\npaper we propose a mathematical and computational model to study the behavior\nof microcirculatory networks subjected to different conditions. The network\ngeometry is composed of a graph of connected straight cylinders, each one\nrepresenting a vessel. The blood flow and pressure drop across the single\nvessel, further split into smaller elements, are related through a generalized\nOhm's law featuring a conductivity parameter, function of the vessel cross\nsection area and geometry, which undergo deformations under pressure loads. The\nmembrane theory is used to describe the deformation of vessel lumina, tailored\nto the structure of thick-walled arterioles and thin-walled venules. In\naddition, since venules can possibly experience negative transmural pressures,\na buckling model is also included to represent vessel collapse. The complete\nmodel including arterioles, capillaries and venules represents a nonlinear\nsystem of PDEs, which is approached numerically by finite element\ndiscretization and linearization techniques. We use the model to simulate flow\nin the microcirculation of the human eye retina, a terminal system with a\nsingle inlet and outlet. After a phase of validation against experimental\nmeasurements, we simulate the network response to different interstitial\npressure values. Such a study is carried out both for global and localized\nvariations of the interstitial pressure. In both cases, significant\nredistributions of the blood flow in the network arise, highlighting the\nimportance of considering the single vessel behavior along with its position\nand connectivity in the network.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02292v1', ['Tissues and Organs'], []]
[u'Analysis of a model microswimmer with applications to blebbing cells and\n  mini-robots', ['Qixuan Wang', 'Hans G.

One mode\nis swimming by blebbing or other shape changes, and in this paper we analyze a\nclass of models for movement of cells by blebbing and of nano- robots in a\nviscous fluid at low Reynolds number. At the level of individuals, the shape\nchanges comprise volume exchanges between connected spheres that can control\ntheir separation, which are simple enough that significant analytical results\ncan be obtained. The goal is to understand how the efficiency of move- ment\ndepends on the amplitude and period of the volume exchanges when the spheres\napproach closely during a cycle. Previous analyses were predicated on wide\nseparation, and we show that the speed in- creases significantly as the\nseparation decreases due to the strong hydrodynamic interactions between\nspheres in close proximity. The scallop theorem asserts that at least two\ndegrees of freedom are needed to produce net motion in a cyclic sequence of\nshape changes, and we show that these degrees can reside in different swimmers\nwhose collective motion is studied. We also show that different combinations of\nmode sharing can lead to significant differences in the translation and\nperformance of pairs of swimmers.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02090v1', ['Cell Behavior'], []]
[u'Effective Classification of MicroRNA Precursors Using Combinatorial\n  Feature Mining and AdaBoost Algorithms', ['Ling Zhong', 'Jason T. L. Wang'], u'2016-10-06', u'MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs with approximately 22 nucleotides (nt)\nthat are derived from precursor molecules. These precursor molecules or\npre-miRNAs often fold into stem-loop hairpin structures. However, a large\nnumber of sequences with pre-miRNA-like hairpins can be found in genomes. It is\na challenge to distinguish the real pre-miRNAs from other hairpin sequences\nwith similar stem-loops (referred to as pseudo pre-miRNAs). Several\ncomputational methods have been developed to tackle this challenge. In this\npaper we propose a new method, called MirID, for identifying and classifying\nmicroRNA precursors. We collect 74 features from the sequences and secondary\nstructures of pre-miRNAs; some of these features are taken from our previous\nstudies on non-coding RNA prediction while others were suggested in the\nliterature. We develop a combinatorial feature mining algorithm to identify\nsuitable feature sets. These feature sets are then used to train support vector\nmachines to obtain classification models, based on which classifier ensemble is\nconstructed. Finally we use an AdaBoost algorithm to further enhance the\naccuracy of the classifier ensemble.
