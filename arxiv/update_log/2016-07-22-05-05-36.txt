[u'Retardation of Bulk Water Dynamics by Disaccharide Osmolytes', ['Nimesh Shukla', 'Enrico Pomarico', 'Lee Chen', 'Majed Chergui', 'Christina M. Othon'], u'2016-07-21', u'The bioprotective nature of disaccharides is hypothesized to derive from the\nmodification of the hydrogen bonding network of water which protects\nbiomolecules through lowered water activity at the protein interface. Using\nultrafast fluorescence spectroscopy we measured the relaxation of bulk water\ndynamics around the induced dipole moment of two fluorescent probes (Lucifer\nYellow Ethylenediamine and Tryptophan). Our results indicate a reduction in\nbulk water reorganization rate of approximately of 30%. We observe this\nretardation in the low concentration regime measured at 0.1M and 0.25 M, far\nbelow the onset of glassy dynamics. This reduction in water activity could be\nsignificant in crowded biological systems, contributing to global change in\nprotein energy landscape, resulting in a significant enhancement of protein\nstability under environmental stress. We observed similar dynamic reduction for\ntwo disaccharide osmolytes, sucrose and trehalose, with trehalose being the\nmore effective dynamic reducer.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06369v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Next generation neural mass models', ['Stephen Coombes', 'Aine Byrne'], u'2016-07-21', u'Neural mass models have been actively used since the 1970s to model the\ncoarse grained activity of large populations of neurons and synapses. They have\nproven especially useful in understanding brain rhythms. However, although\nmotivated by neurobiological considerations they are phenomenological in\nnature, and cannot hope to recreate some of the rich repertoire of responses\nseen in real neuronal tissue. In this chapter we consider the $\\theta$-neuron\nmodel that has recently been shown to admit to an exact mean-field description\nfor instantaneous pulsatile interactions. We show that the inclusion of a more\nrealistic synapse model leads to a mean-field model that has many of the\nfeatures of a neural mass model coupled to a further dynamical equation that\ndescribes the evolution of network synchrony. A bifurcation analysis is used to\nuncover the primary mechanism for generating oscillations at the single and two\npopulation level. Numerical simulations also show that the phenomena of event\nrelated synchronisation and desynchronisation are easily realised. Importantly\nunlike its phenomenological counterpart this \\textit{next generation neural\nmass model} is an exact macroscopic description of an underlying microscopic\nspiking neurodynamics, and is a natural candidate for use in future large scale\nhuman brain simulations.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06251v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Stochastic Ising model with plastic interactions', ['Eugene Pechersky', 'Guillem Via', 'Anatoly Yambartsev'], u'2016-07-20', u'We propose a new model based on the Ising model with the aim to study\nsynaptic plasticity phenomena in neural networks. It is today well established\nin biology that the synapses or connections between certain types of neurons\nare strengthened when the neurons are co-active, a form of the so called\nsynaptic plasticity. Such mechanism is believed to mediate the formation and\nmaintenance of memories. The proposed model describes some features from that\nphenomenon. Together with the spin-flip dynamics, in our model the coupling\nconstants are also subject to stochastic dynamics, so that they interact with\neach other. The evolution of the system is described by a continuous-time\nMarkov jump process.\n  Keyword Markov chain, Stochastic Ising model, synaptic plasticity, neural\nnetworks, transience', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06133v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Do branch lengths help to locate a tree in a phylogenetic network?', ['Philippe Gambette', 'Leo van Iersel', 'Steven Kelk', 'Fabio Pardi', 'Celine Scornavacca'], u'2016-07-21', u'Phylogenetic networks are increasingly used in evolutionary biology to\nrepresent the history of species that have undergone reticulate events such as\nhorizontal gene transfer, hybrid speciation and recombination. One of the most\nfundamental questions that arise in this context is whether the evolution of a\ngene with one copy in all species can be explained by a given network. In\nmathematical terms, this is often translated in the following way: is a given\nphylogenetic tree contained in a given phylogenetic network? Recently this tree\ncontainment problem has been widely investigated from a computational\nperspective, but most studies have only focused on the topology of the phylo-\ngenies, ignoring a piece of information that, in the case of phylogenetic\ntrees, is routinely inferred by evolutionary analyses: branch lengths. These\nmeasure the amount of change (e.g., nucleotide substitutions) that has occurred\nalong each branch of the phylogeny. Here, we study a number of versions of the\ntree containment problem that explicitly account for branch lengths. We show\nthat, although length information has the potential to locate more precisely a\ntree within a network, the problem is computationally hard in its most general\nform. On a positive note, for a number of special cases of biological\nrelevance, we provide algorithms that solve this problem efficiently. This\nincludes the case of networks of limited complexity, for which it is possible\nto recover, among the trees contained by the network with the same topology as\nthe input tree, the closest one in terms of branch lengths.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06285v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Species survival and scaling laws in hostile and fluctuating\n  environments', ['Rodrigo P. Rocha', 'Wagner Figueiredo', 'Samir Suweis', 'Amos Maritan'], u'2016-07-21', u'In this work we study the likelihood of survival of single-species in the\ncontext of hostile and fluctuating environments. Population dynamics in this\nenvironment, as modeled by the Fisher equation, is characterized by negative\naverage growth rate, except in some random spatially distributed patches that\nmay support life. In particular, we are interested in the phase diagram of the\nsurvival probability and in the critical size problem, i.e., the minimum patch\nsize required for surviving in the long time dynamics. We propose a measure for\nthe critical patch size as being proportional to the participation ratio ($PR$)\nof the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of the linearized\nFisher dynamics. We obtain the (extinction-survival) phase diagram and the\nprobability distribution function (PDF) of the critical patch sizes for two\ntopologies, namely, the one-dimensional system and the fractal Peano basin. We\nshow that both topologies share the same qualitative features, but the fractal\ntopology requires higher spatial fluctuations to guarantee species survival. We\nperform a finite-size scaling and we obtain the associated critical exponents.\nIn addition, we show that the PDF of the critical patch sizes has an universal\nshape for the 1D case in terms of the model parameters (diffusion, growth rate,\netc.). In contrast, the diffusion coefficient has a drastic effect on the PDF\nof the critical patch sizes of the fractal Peano basin, and it does not obey\nthe same scaling law of the 1D case.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06225v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Bayesian uncertainty analysis for complex systems biology models:\n  emulation, global parameter searches and evaluation of gene functions', ['Ian Vernon', 'Junli Liu', 'Michael Goldstein', 'James Rowe', 'Jen Topping', 'Keith Lindsey'], u'2016-07-21', u'Background: Many mathematical models have now been employed across every area\nof systems biology. These models increasingly involve large numbers of unknown\nparameters, have complex structure which can result in substantial evaluation\ntime relative to the needs of the analysis, and need to be compared to observed\ndata. The correct analysis of such models usually requires a global parameter\nsearch, over a high dimensional parameter space, that incorporates and respects\nthe most important sources of uncertainty. This can be an extremely difficult\ntask, but it is essential for any meaningful inference or prediction to be made\nabout any biological system. It hence represents a fundamental challenge for\nthe whole of systems biology.\n  Results: Bayesian statistical methodology for the uncertainty analysis of\ncomplex models is introduced, which is designed to address the high dimensional\nglobal parameter search problem. Bayesian emulators that mimic the systems\nbiology model but which are extremely fast to evaluate are embedded within an\niterative history match: an efficient method to search high dimensional spaces\nwithin a more formal statistical setting, while incorporating major sources of\nuncertainty. The approach is demonstrated via application to two models of\nhormonal crosstalk in Arabidopsis root development, which have 32 rate\nparameters, for which we identify the sets of rate parameter values that lead\nto acceptable matches to observed trend data. The biological consequences of\nthe resulting comparison, including the evaluation of gene functions, are\ndescribed.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06358v1', ['Quantitative Methods', 'Molecular Networks', 'Cell Behavior'], []]
[u'Seasonal and geographical influence on sleeping patterns inferred from\n  mobile phone data', ['Daniel Monsivais', 'Kunal Bhattacharya', 'Asim Ghosh', 'Kimmo Kaski'], u'2016-07-21', u'Influence of the sunrise, sunset and daylight on the human sleep wake cycle\nhas been primarily studied using questionnaires from limited size cohorts. The\nstudies indicate that it varies along the year while the sunrise and sunset\ncould be related with the onset and conclusion of sleep. Here, we take an\nempirical data-driven approach by utilizing anonymized mobile phone data or\n"digital footprints" of very large size cohort during a year. Using aggregated\ncalling patterns we construct the distributions for the daily first and last\ncalls in different cities along the year. We also characterize a daily period\nof low calling activity that allows to infer the dependence of the sleep-wake\ncycle on geographical location and the seasonal changes. We find rather\nsurprisingly that the mobile phone users synchronize their last and first calls\nwith the local sun transit time along the longitude they are located. Further\nanalysis reveals that the difference between the durations of the low activity\nperiod in the summer and the winter is governed by the latitude of the users\'\ndomiciles, such that people in the southern cities experience a time difference\nalmost twice as large as the people in cities located 8 degrees to the north.\nFinally, we argue that the synchronization of the onset and the middle of the\nperiod of low calling activity in cities is entrained by sun-based clocks with\nthe solar noon (or solar midnight) being the most plausible candidate for this\npacemaking.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06341v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
