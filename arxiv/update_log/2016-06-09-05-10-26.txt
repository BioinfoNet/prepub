[u'Role of Genome in the Formation of Conical Retroviral Shells', ['Gonca Erdemci-Tandogan', 'Jef Wagner', 'Paul van der Schoot', 'Roya Zandi'], u'2016-05-23', u'Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) capsid proteins spontaneously assemble\naround the genome into a protective protein shell called the capsid, which can\ntake on a variety of shapes broadly classified as conical, cylindrical and\nirregular. The majority of capsids seen in in vivo studies are conical in\nshape, while in vitro experiments have shown a preference for cylindrical\ncapsids. The factors involved in the selection of the unique shape of HIV\ncapsids are not well understood, and in particular the impact of RNA on the\nformation of the capsid is not known. In this work, we study the role of the\ngenome and its interaction with the capsid protein by modeling the genomic RNA\nthrough a mean-field theory. Our results show that the confinement free energy\nfor a homopolymeric model genome confined in a conical capsid is lower than\nthat in a cylindrical capsid, at least when the genome does not interact with\nthe capsid, which seems to be the case in in vivo experiments. Conversely, the\nconfinement free energy for the cylinder is lower than for a conical capsid if\nthe genome is attracted to the capsid proteins as the in vitro experiments.\nUnderstanding the factors that contribute to the formation of conical capsids\nmay shed light on the infectivity of HIV particles.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07226v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Brains on Beats', ['Umut Guclu', 'Jordy Thielen', 'Michael Hanke', 'Marcel A. J. van Gerven'], u'2016-06-08', u'We developed task-optimized deep neural networks (DNNs) that achieved\nstate-of-the-art performance in different evaluation scenarios for automatic\nmusic tagging. These DNNs were subsequently used to probe the neural\nrepresentations of music. Representational similarity analysis revealed the\nexistence of a representational gradient across the superior temporal gyrus\n(STG). Anterior STG was shown to be more sensitive to low-level stimulus\nfeatures encoded in shallow DNN layers whereas posterior STG was shown to be\nmore sensitive to high-level stimulus features encoded in deep DNN layers.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02627v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

Starr', 'Agustin Ibanez', 'Mario A. Parra', 'Javier Escudero', 'Pierre Vandergheynst'], u'2016-06-08', u"Visual short-term memory binding tasks are a promising early biomarker for\nAlzheimer's disease (AD). We probe the transient physiological underpinnings of\nthese tasks over the healthy brain's functional connectome by contrasting shape\nonly (Shape) and shape-colour binding (Bind) conditions, displayed in the left\nand right sides of the screen, separately, in young volunteers.\nElectroencephalogram recordings during the encoding and maintenance periods of\nthese tasks are analysed using functional connectomics. Particularly, we\nintroduce and implement a novel technique named Modular Dirichlet Energy (MDE)\nwhich allows robust and flexible analysis of the connectome with\nunprecedentedly high temporal precision. We find that connectivity in the Bind\ncondition is stronger than in the Shape condition in both occipital and frontal\nnetwork modules during the encoding period of the right screen condition but\nnot the left screen condition. Using MDE we are able to discern driving effects\nin the occipital module between 100-140ms, which noticeably coincides with the\nP100 visually evoked potential, and a driving effect in the interaction of\noccipital and frontal modules between 120-140ms, suggesting a delayed\ninformation processing difference between these modules. This provides\ntemporally precise information over a heterogenous population for tasks related\nto the sensitive and specific detection of AD.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02587v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Entrainment of traveling waves to rhythmic motor acts', ['Joaquin Rapela'], u'2016-06-08', u'We hypothesized that rhythmic motor acts entrain neural oscillations in\nspeech production brain regions. We tested this hypothesis in an experiment\nwhere a subject produced consonant-vowel (CV) syllables in a rhythmic fashion,\nwhile we performed ECoG recordings. Over the ventral sensorimotor cortex (vSMC)\nwe detected significant concentration of phase across trials at the specific\nfrequency of speech production. We also observed amplitude modulations. In\naddition we found significant coupling between the phase of brain oscillations\nat the frequency of speech production and their amplitude in the high-gamma\nrange (i.e., phase-amplitude coupling, PAC). Furthermore, we saw that brain\noscillations at the frequency of speech production organized as traveling waves\n(TWs), synchronized to the rhythm of speech production. It has been\nhypothesized that PAC is a mechanism to allow low-frequency oscillations to\nsynchronize with high-frequency neural activity so that spiking occurs at\nbehaviorally relevant times. If this hypothesis is true, when PAC coexists with\nTWs, we expect a specific organization of PAC curves. We observed this\norganization experimentally and verified that the peaks of high-gamma\noscillations, and therefore spiking, occur at the same times across electrodes.\nImportantly, we observed that these spiking times were synchronized with the\nrhythm of speech production. To our knowledge, this is the first report of\nmotor actions organizing (a) the phase coherence of low-frequency brain\noscillations, (b) the coupling between the phase of these oscillations and the\namplitude of high-frequency oscillations, and (c) TW. It is also the first\ndemonstration that TWs induce an organization of PAC so that spiking across\nspatial locations is synchronized to behaviorally relevant times.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02372v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Locally-Optimized Inter-Subject Alignment of Functional Cortical Regions', ['Marius Catalin Iordan', 'Armand Joulin', 'Diane M. Beck', 'Li Fei-Fei'], u'2016-06-07', u'Inter-subject registration of cortical areas is necessary in functional\nimaging (fMRI) studies for making inferences about equivalent brain function\nacross a population. However, many high-level visual brain areas are defined as\npeaks of functional contrasts whose cortical position is highly variable. As\nsuch, most alignment methods fail to accurately map functional regions of\ninterest (ROIs) across participants. To address this problem, we propose a\nlocally optimized registration method that directly predicts the location of a\nseed ROI on a separate target cortical sheet by maximizing the functional\ncorrelation between their time courses, while simultaneously allowing for\nnon-smooth local deformations in region topology. Our method outperforms the\ntwo most commonly used alternatives (anatomical landmark-based AFNI alignment\nand cortical convexity-based FreeSurfer alignment) in overlap between predicted\nregion and functionally-defined LOC. Furthermore, the maps obtained using our\nmethod are more consistent across subjects than both baseline measures.\nCritically, our method represents an important step forward towards predicting\nbrain regions without explicit localizer scans and deciphering the poorly\nunderstood relationship between the location of functional regions, their\nanatomical extent, and the consistency of computations those regions perform\nacross people.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02349v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Resting state brain networks from EEG: Hidden Markov states vs.\n  classical microstates', ['Tammo Rukat', 'Adam Baker', 'Andrew Quinn', 'Mark Woolrich'], u'2016-06-07', u'Functional brain networks exhibit dynamics on the sub-second temporal scale\nand are often assumed to embody the physiological substrate of cognitive\nprocesses. Here we analyse the temporal and spatial dynamics of these states,\nas measured by EEG, with a hidden Markov model and compare this approach to\nclassical EEG microstate analysis. We find dominating state lifetimes of\n100--150\\,ms for both approaches. The state topographies show obvious\nsimilarities. However, they also feature distinct spatial and especially\ntemporal properties. These differences may carry physiological meaningful\ninformation originating from patterns in the data that the HMM is able to\nintegrate while the microstate analysis is not. This hypothesis is supported by\na consistently high pairwise correlation of the temporal evolution of EEG\nmicrostates which is not observed for the HMM states and which seems unlikely\nto be a good description of the underlying physiology. However, further\ninvestigation is required to determine the robustness and the functional and\nclinical relevance of EEG HMM states in comparison to EEG microstates.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02344v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

We then\ndescribe three published studies in which we have developed EGT models that\nhelp explain how structural and external conditions in a society affect the\nemergence of social norms.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02570v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'The Generalized Langevin Equation and the Parameterization from Data', ['Huan Lei', 'Nathan Baker', 'Xiantao Li'], u'2016-06-08', u'We present a data-driven approach to determine the memory kernel and random\nnoise of the generalized Langevin equation. To facilitate practical\nimplementations, we parameterize the kernel function in the Laplace domain by a\nrational function, with coefficients directly linked to the equi- librium\nstatistics of the coarse-grain variables. Further, we show that such an\napproximation can be constructed to arbitrarily high order. Within these\napproximations, the generalized Langevin dynamics can be embedded in an\nextended stochastic model without memory. We demonstrate how to introduce the\nstochastic noise so that the fluctuation-dissipation theorem is exactly\nsatisfied.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02596v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
