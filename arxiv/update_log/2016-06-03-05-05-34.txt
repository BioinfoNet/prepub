[u'Multi-View Treelet Transform', ['Brian A. Mitchell', 'Linda R. Petzold'], u'2016-06-02', u'Current multi-view factorization methods make assumptions that are not\nacceptable for many kinds of data, and in particular, for graphical data with\nhierarchical structure. At the same time, current hierarchical methods work\nonly in the single-view setting. We generalize the Treelet Transform to the\nMulti-View Treelet Transform (MVTT) to allow for the capture of hierarchical\nstructure when multiple views are avilable. Further, we show how this\ngeneralization is consistent with the existing theory and how it might be used\nin denoising empirical networks and in computing the shared response of\nfunctional brain data.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00800v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Towards a statistical mechanics of consciousness: maximization of number\n  of connections is associated with conscious awareness', ['R. Guevara Erra', 'D. M. Mateos', 'R. Wennberg', 'J. L. Perez Velazquez'], u'2016-06-01', u'It has been said that complexity lies between order and disorder. In the case\nof brain activity, and physiology in general, complexity issues are being\nconsidered with increased emphasis. We sought to identify features of brain\norganization that are optimal for sensory processing, and that may guide the\nemergence of cognition and consciousness, by analysing neurophysiological\nrecordings in conscious and unconscious states. We find a surprisingly simple\nresult: normal wakeful states are characterised by the greatest number of\npossible configurations of interactions between brain networks, representing\nhighest entropy values. Therefore, the information content is larger in the\nnetwork associated to conscious states, suggesting that consciousness could be\nthe result of an optimization of information processing. These findings\nencapsulate three main current theories of cognition, as discussed in the text,\nand more specifically the conceptualization of consciousness in terms of brain\ncomplexity. We hope our study represents the preliminary attempt at finding\norganising principles of brain function that will help to guide in a more\nformal sense inquiry into how consciousness arises from the organization of\nmatter.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00821v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Noise Induced Synchronization on Collective Dynamics of Citrus\n  Production', ['Nina Sviridova', 'Kenshi Sakai'], u'2016-06-02', u'It is very common to observe nonlinear features in agricultural and\necological systems. For example, in tree crop production, alternate bearing is\nwell known phenomena caused by nonlinear dynamics. Production of single tree of\nCitrus Unshiu trees is recognized to be driven by a mechanistic process modeled\nwith the so-called "resource budget model", which demonstrates phenomenon of\nalternate bearing. However, the term of alternative bearing is used not only\nfor an individual tree\'s production but also for total production of a large\nsized population of trees. In this paper, we developed noise induced uncoupled\ndynamics model for population alternate bearing based on Isagi\'s resource\nbudget model. Based on numerical experiments with the developed model,\ntheoretical possibility of a substantial alternate bearing effect even in a\nnational market was proposed.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00632v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

[u'Permutation-based cluster size correction for voxel-based lesion-symptom\n  mapping', ['Daniel Mirman', 'Jon-Frederick Landrigan', 'Spiro Kokolis', 'Sean Verillo', 'Casey Ferrara'], u'2016-06-01', u'Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) is a major method for studying\nbrain-behavior relationships that leverages modern neuroimaging analysis\ntechniques to build on the classic approach of examining the relationship\nbetween location of brain damage and cognitive deficits. Testing an association\nbetween deficit severity and lesion status in each voxel involves very many\nindividual tests and requires statistical correction for multiple comparisons.\nSeveral strategies have been adapted from analysis of functional neuroimaging\ndata, though VLSM faces a more difficult trade-off between avoiding false\npositives and statistical power (missing true effects). One such strategy is\nusing permutation to non-parametrically determine a null distribution of\ncluster sizes, which is then used to establish a minimum cluster size\nthreshold. This strategy is intuitively appealing because it respects the\nnecessary spatial contiguity of stroke lesions and connects with the typical\ncluster-based interpretation of VLSM results. We evaluated this strategy for\ndetecting true lesion-symptom relations using simulated deficit scores based on\npercent damage to defined brain regions (BA 45 and BA 39) in a sample of 124\nindividuals with left hemisphere stroke. Even under the most conservative\nsettings tested here, the region identified by VLSM with cluster size\ncorrection systematically extended well beyond the true region. As a result,\nthis strategy appears to be effective for ruling out situations with no true\nlesion-symptom relations, but the spatial contiguity of stroke lesions may\ncause identified lesion-symptom relations to extend beyond their true regions.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00475v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Conditions for cell size homeostasis: A stochastic hybrid systems\n  approach', ['Cesar Augusto Vargas-Garcia', 'Mohammad Soltani', 'Abhyudai Singh'], u'2016-06-02', u'A ubiquitous feature of living cells is their growth over time followed by\ndivision into daughter cells. How isogenic cell populations maintain size\nhomeostasis, i.e., a narrow distribution of cell size, is an intriguing\nfundamental problem. We model cell size using a stochastic hybrid system, where\na cell grows exponentially in size (volume) over time and probabilistic\ndivision events are triggered at discrete time intervals. Moreover, whenever\ndivision events occur, size is randomly partitioned among daughter cells. We\nfirst consider a scenario, where a timer (i.e., cell-cycle clock) that measures\nthe time since the last division event regulates both the cellular growth and\ndivision rates. Analysis reveals that such a timer-controlled system cannot\nachieve size homeostasis, in the sense that, the cell-to-cell size variation\ngrows unboundedly with time. To explore biologically meaningful mechanisms for\ncontrolling size we consider two classes of regulation: a size-dependent growth\nrate and a size-dependent division rate. Our results show that these strategies\ncan provide bounded intercellular variation in cell size, and exact\nmathematical conditions on the form of regulation needed for size homeostasis\nare derived. Different known forms of size control strategies, such as, the\nadder and the sizer are shown to be consistent with these results.\nInterestingly, for timer-based division mechanisms, the mean cell size depends\non the noise in the cell-cycle duration but independent of errors incurred in\npartitioning of volume among daughter cells. In contrast, the mean cell size\ndecreases with increasing partitioning errors for size-based division\nmechanisms. Finally, we discuss how organisms ranging from bacteria to\nmammalian cells have adopted different control approaches for maintaining size\nhomeostasis.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00535v1', ['Cell Behavior'], []]

We\ndeveloped a dynamic sequence-based barcode for lineage tracing and have\ndemonstrated its performance in C. elegans, a model organism whose lineage tree\nis well established. The strategy we use creates lineage trees based upon the\nintroduction of specific mutations into cells and the propagation of these\nmutations to daughter cells at each cell division. We present an experimental\nproof of concept along with a corresponding simulation and analytical model for\ndeeper understanding of the coding capacity of the system.
