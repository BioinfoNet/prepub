[u'Ripping RNA by Force using Gaussian Network Models', ['Changbong Hyeon', 'D.

Although the unfolding pathways under tension are complicated to\npredict studies in the context of proteins have shown that topology plays is\nthe major determinant of the unfolding landscapes. By building on this finding\nwe study the responses of RNA molecules to force by adapting Gaussian network\nmodel (GNM) that represents RNAs using a bead-spring network with isotropic\ninteractions. Cross-correlation matrices of residue fluctuations, which are\nanalytically calculated using GNM even upon application of mechanical force,\nshow distinct allosteric communication as RNAs rupture. The model is used to\ncalculate the force-extension curves at full thermodynamic equilibrium, and the\ncorresponding unfolding pathways of four RNA molecules subject to a\nquasi-statically increased force.Our study finds that the analysis using GNM\ncaptures qualitatively the unfolding pathway of \\emph{T}. ribozyme elucidated\nby the optical tweezers measurement. However, the simple model is not\nsufficient to capture subtle features, such as bifurcation in the unfolding\npathways or the ion effects, in the forced-unfolding of RNAs.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05321v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Multi-contact synapses for stable networks: a spike-timing dependent\n  model of dendritic spine plasticity and turnover', ['Moritz Deger', 'Alexander Seeholzer', 'Wulfram Gerstner'], u'2016-09-19', u'Excitatory synaptic connections in the adult neocortex consist of multiple\nsynaptic contacts, almost exclusively formed on dendritic spines. Changes of\ndendritic spine shape and volume, a correlate of synaptic strength, can be\ntracked in vivo for weeks. Here, we present a combined model of spike-timing\ndependent dendritic spine plasticity and turnover that explains the steady\nstate multi-contact configuration of synapses in adult neocortical networks. In\nthis model, many presynaptic neurons compete to make strong synaptic\nconnections onto postsynaptic neurons, while the synaptic contacts comprising\neach connection cooperate via postsynaptic firing. We demonstrate that the\nmodel is consistent with experimentally observed long-term dendritic spine\ndynamics under steady-state and lesion induced conditions, and show that\ncooperation of multiple synaptic contacts is crucial for stable, long-term\nsynaptic memories. In simulations of a simplified network of barrel cortex, our\nplasticity rule reproduces whisker-trimming induced rewiring of\nthalamo-cortical and recurrent synaptic connectivity on realistic time scales.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05730v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'The effect of distributed time-delays on the synchronization of neuronal\n  networks', ['Ajay Deep Kachhvah'], u'2016-09-19', u'Here we investigate the synchronization of networks of FitzHugh-Nagumo\nneurons coupled in scale-free, small-world and random topologies, in the\npresence of distributed time delays in the coupling of neurons. We explore how\nthe synchronization transition is affected when the time delays in the\ninteractions between pairs of interacting neurons are non-uniform. We find that\nthe presence of distributed time-delays does not change the behavior of the\nsynchronization transition significantly, vis-a-vis networks with constant\ntime-delay, where the value of the constant time-delay is the mean of the\ndistributed delays. We also notice that a normal distribution of delays gives\nrise to a transition at marginally lower coupling strengths, vis-a-vis\nuniformly distributed delays. These trends hold across classes of networks and\nfor varying standard deviations of the delay distribution, indicating the\ngenerality of these results. So we conclude that distributed delays, which may\nbe typically expected in real-world situations, do not have a notable effect on\nsynchronization. This allows results obtained with constant delays to remain\nrelevant even in the case of randomly distributed delays.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05606v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

[u'Evolution as a coexistence mechanism: Does genetic architecture matter?', ['Sebastian J. Schreiber', 'Swati Patel', 'Casey terHorst'], u'2016-09-19', u'Species sharing a prey or a predator species may go extinct due to\nexploitative or apparent competition. We examined whether evolution of the\nshared species acts as a coexistence mechanism and to what extent the answer\ndepends on the genetic architecture underlying the evolving traits. Our models\nconsider two ecological modules in which either two predators share one prey\nspecies (exploitative competition) or one predator species exploits two prey\n(apparent competition). The shared species evolves defense or prey use in these\nmodules. Evolving species are either haploid or diploid. A single locus\npleiotropically determines the nutritional quality of prey and the ability to\ncapture prey. When pleiotropy is sufficiently antagonistic (e.g. nutritional\nprey are harder to capture), community assembly culminates in one of two stable\nstates supporting only two species. When pleiotropy is weakly antagonistic or\nsynergistic, the assembly dynamics are intransitive: species-genotype pairs are\nsuccessively displaced in a cyclic fashion by rare invasions of the missing\ngenotypes or species. This intransitive dynamic allows for coexistence if,\nalong its equilibria, the geometric mean of recovery rates of rare genotypes or\nspecies exceeds the geometric mean of loss rates of rare genotypes or species.\nBy affecting these rates, synergistic pleiotropy can mediate coexistence, while\nantagonistic pleiotropy does not. For diploid populations experiencing weak\nantagonistic pleiotropy, superadditive contributions of alleles to heterozygote\nfitness can mitigate coexistence via an eco-evolutionary storage effect.\nDensity-dependence and mutations also can mitigate coexistence. These results\nsuggest that eco-evolutionary feedbacks can maintain genetic and species\ndiversity, but the strength of this coexistence mechanism depends on the\nunderlying genetic architecture.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05571v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Public Goods Games on Adaptive Coevolutionary Networks', ['Avi M.

Public Goods Games (PGGs) are frequently used\nto study the development of social connections and cooperative behavior in\nmodel societies. In such games, contributions to the public good are made only\nby cooperators, while all players, including defectors, can reap public goods\nbenefits. Classic results of game theory show that mutual defection, as opposed\nto cooperation, is the Nash Equilibrium of PGGs in well-mixed populations,\nwhere each player interacts with all others. In this paper, we explore the\ncoevolutionary dynamics of a low information public goods game on a network\nwithout spatial constraints in which players adapt to their environment in\norder to increase individual payoffs. Players adapt by changing their\nstrategies, either to cooperate or to defect, and by altering their social\nconnections.

[u'Improving landscape inference by integrating heterogeneous data in the\n  inverse Ising problem', ['Pierre Barrat-Charlaix', 'Matteo Figliuzzi', 'Martin Weigt'], u'2016-09-19', u'The inverse Ising problem and its generalizations to Potts and continuous\nspin models have recently attracted much attention thanks to their successful\napplications in the statistical modeling of biological data. In the standard\nsetting, the parameters of an Ising model (couplings and fields) are inferred\nusing a sample of equilibrium configurations drawn from the Boltzmann\ndistribution. However, in the context of biological applications, quantitative\ninformation for a limited number of microscopic spins configurations has\nrecently become available. In this paper, we extend the usual setting of the\ninverse Ising model by developing an integrative approach combining the\nequilibrium sample with (possibly noisy) measurements of the energy performed\nfor a number of arbitrary configurations. Using simulated data, we show that\nour integrative approach outperforms standard inference based only on the\nequilibrium sample or the energy measurements, including error correction of\nnoisy energy measurements.

[u'Uncertainty of current understanding regarding OBT formation in plants', ['Anca Melintescu', 'Dan Galeriu'], u'2016-09-16', u'The radiological impact models are important tools for supporting nuclear\nsafety. For tritium, a special radionuclide entering the life cycle, the\nprocesses involved in its transport into the environment are complex and not\nwell enough understood. The tritiated water (HTO) enters the plants by\natmospheric and root pathway and is converted to organically bound tritium\n(OBT) in exchangeable and non-exchangeable forms. The observed OBT/HTO ratios\nin crops exhibit a large variability and contradict the current models for\nroutine releases. If a spike release (i.e. short time but intense atmospheric\nrelease higher than the normal release rate) occurs during routine emission,\nthe dose to public is higher than for normal routine emission. The experimental\ndata for a short and intense atmospheric contamination of wheat are presented\ntogether with the models predictions. Although the current understanding of\nprocesses involved in OBT formation in plants is still insufficient,\nconsidering the non-equilibrium situation in field conditions, some results are\nobtained. The OBT/HTO ratio depends on the dynamics of stack emission, receptor\nlocation and crop type. The models for public dose assessment can be used in a\nprobabilistic way or deterministic way using more conservative parameters. The\ninfluence of a spike release is analysed, but the quantitative results are not\npossible due to models uncertainties. The experimental data on wheat\ndemonstrate that the OBT formation is a long process, there are differences\nbetween night and day releases and the HTO dynamics in leaf and ear is a very\nimportant contributor to OBT formation.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05052v1', ['Tissues and Organs'], []]
[u'Fundamental costs in the production and destruction of persistent\n  polymer copies', ['Thomas E. Ouldridge', 'Pieter Rein ten Wolde'], u'2016-09-18', u'The copying of a polymer sequence into a new polymer is central to biology.\nAlthough the growth of a copy attached to its template has received much\nattention, effective copies must persist after template separation. We show\nthat this separation has three fundamental thermodynamic effects. Firstly,\nattractive polymer-template interactions favor polymerization but inhibit\nseparation, playing a double-edged role. Secondly, given separation, more work\nis always necessary to create a specific copy than a non-specific polymer of\nthe same length. Finally, the mixing of copies from distinct templates makes\ncorrelations between template and copy sequences unexploitable, combining with\ncopying inaccuracy to reduce the free energy stored in a polymer ensemble. This\nlower stored free energy in turn reduces the minimal entropy generation during\nnon-specific depolymerization.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05554v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
[u'A Deterministic Mathematical Model for Bidirectional Excluded Flow with\n  Langmuir Kinetics', ['Yoram Zarai', 'Michael Margaliot', 'Tamir Tuller'], u'2016-09-19', u'In many important cellular processes, including mRNA translation, gene\ntranscription, phosphotransfer, and intracellular transport, biological\n"particles" move along some kind of "tracks". The motion of these particles can\nbe modeled as a one-dimensional movement along an ordered sequence of sites.\nThe biological particles (e.g., ribosomes, RNAPs, phosphate groups, motor\nproteins) have volume and cannot surpass one another. In some cases, there is a\npreferred direction of movement along the track, but in general the movement\nmay be two-directional, and furthermore the particles may attach or detach from\nvarious regions along the tracks (e.g. ribosomes may drop off the mRNA molecule\nbefore reaching a stop codon). We derive a new deterministic mathematical model\nfor such transport phenomena that may be interpreted as the dynamic mean-field\napproximation of an important model from mechanical statistics called the\nasymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) with Langmuir kinetics. Using tools\nfrom the theory of monotone dynamical systems and contraction theory we show\nthat the model admits a unique globally asymptotically stable equilibrium. This\nmeans that the occupancy in all the sites along the lattice converges to a\nsteady-state value that depends on the parameters but not on the initial\nconditions. We also show that the model entrains (or phase locks) to periodic\nexcitations in any of its forward, backward, attachment, or detachment rates.\nWe demonstrate an application of this phenomenological transport model for\nanalyzing the effect of ribosome drop off in mRNA translation. One may perhaps\nexpect that drop off from a jammed site may increase the total flow by reducing\ncongestion. Our results show that this is not true. Drop off has a substantial\neffect on the flow, yet always leads to a reduction in the steady-state protein\nproduction rate.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05676v1', ['Subcellular Processes'], []]
[u'Self-tolerance and autoimmunity in a minimal model of the idiotypic\n  network', ['Stefan Landmann', 'Nicolas Preuss', 'Ulrich Behn'], u'2016-09-19', u'We consider self-tolerance and its failure -autoimmunity- in a minimal\nmathematical model of the idiotypic network. A node in the network represents a\nclone of B-lymphocytes and its antibodies of the same idiotype which is encoded\nby a bitstring. The links between nodes represent possible interactions between\nclones of almost complementary idiotype. A clone survives only if the number of\npopulated neighbored nodes is neither too small nor too large. The dynamics is\ndriven by the influx of lymphocytes with randomly generated idiotype from the\nbone marrow. Previous work has revealed that the network evolves towards a\nhighly organized modular architecture, characterized by groups of nodes which\nshare statistical properties. The structural properties of the architecture can\nbe described analytically, the statistical properties determined from\nsimulations are confirmed by a modular mean-field theory. To model the presence\nof self we permanently occupy one or several nodes. These nodes influence their\nlinked neighbors, the autoreactive clones, but are themselves not affected by\nidiotypic interactions. The architecture is very similar to the case without\nself, but organized such that the neighbors of self are only weakly occupied,\nthus providing self-tolerance. This supports the perspective that self-reactive\nclones, which regularly occur in healthy organisms, are controlled by\nanti-idiotypic clones. We discuss how perturbations, like an infection with\nforeign antigen, a change in the influx of new idiotypes, or the random removal\nof idiotypes, may lead to autoreactivity and devise protocols which cause a\nreconstitution of the self-tolerant state. The results could be helpful to\nunderstand network and probabilistic aspects of autoimmune disorders.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05735v1', ['Cell Behavior'], []]

In particular, highly abundant\nproteins - which can determine cellular behavior - exhibit large variability in\ncopy number among individuals. Their distribution has a universal shape common\nto different proteins and microorganisms; the same distribution shape is\nmeasured both in populations and in single-cell temporal traces. Moreover,\ndifferent highly expressed proteins are statistically correlated with cell size\nand with cell-cycle time. These results indicate coupling between measurable\nproperties in the cell and buffering of their statistics from the microscopic\nscale. We propose a modeling framework in which the complex intracellular\nprocesses produce a phenotype composed of many effectively interacting\ncomponents. These interactions, as well as the imperfect nature of cell\ndivision events, provide a simple model that reconstructs many properties of\nphenotypic variability on several timescales. These include fluctuating\naccumulation rates along consecutive cell-cycles, with correlations among the\nrates of phenotype components; universal and non-universal properties of\ndistributions; correlations between cell-cycle time and different phenotype\ncomponents; and temporally structured autocorrelation functions with long\n($\\sim 10$ generation) timescales.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05513v1', ['Cell Behavior'], []]
