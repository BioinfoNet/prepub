[u'Trends for isolated amino acids and dipeptides: Conformation, divalent\n  ion binding, and remarkable similarity of binding to calcium and lead', ['Matti Ropo', 'Volker Blum', 'Carsten Baldauf'], u'2016-06-07', u'We derive structural and binding energy trends for twenty amino acids, their\ndipeptides, and their interactions with the divalent cations Ca$^{2+}$,\nBa$^{2+}$, Sr$^{2+}$, Cd$^{2+}$, Pb$^{2+}$, and Hg$^{2+}$. The underlying data\nset consists of 45,892 first-principles predicted conformers with relative\nenergies up to about 4 eV (about 400kJ/mol). We show that only very few\ndistinct backbone structures of isolated amino acids and their dipeptides\nemerge as lowest-energy conformers. The isolated amino acids predominantly\nadopt structures that involve an acidic proton shared between the carboxy and\namino function. Dipeptides adopt one of two intramolecular-hydrogen bonded\nconformations C$_5$ or equatorial C$_7$. Upon complexation with a divalent\ncation, the accessible conformational space shrinks and intramolecular hydrogen\nbonding is prevented due to strong electrostatic interaction of backbone and\nside chain functional groups with cations. Clear correlations emerge from the\nbinding energies of the six divalent ions with amino acids and dipeptides.\nCd$^{2+}$ and Hg$^{2+}$ show the largest binding energies - a potential\ncorrelation with their known high acute toxicities. Ca$^{2+}$ and Pb$^{2+}$\nreveal almost identical binding energies across the entire series of amino\nacids and dipeptides. This observation validates past indications that\nion-mimicry of calcium and lead should play an important role in a\ntoxicological context.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02151v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Inference of Causal Information Flow in Collective Animal Behavior', ['Warren M. Lord', 'Jie Sun', 'Nicholas T. Ouellette', 'Erik M. Bollt'], u'2016-06-03', u'Understanding and even defining what constitutes animal interactions remains\na challenging problem. Correlational tools may be inappropriate for detecting\ncommunication be- tween a set of many agents exhibiting nonlinear behavior. A\ndifferent approach is to define coordinated motions in terms of an information\ntheoretic channel of direct causal information flow. In this work, we present\nan application of the optimal causation entropy (oCSE) principle to identify\nsuch channels between insects engaged in a type of collective motion called\nswarming. The oCSE algorithm infers channels of direct causal inference between\ninsects from time series describing spatial movements. The time series are\ndiscovered by an experimental protocol of optical tracking. The collection of\nchannels infered by oCSE describes a network of information flow within the\nswarm. We find that information channels with a long spatial range are more\ncommon than expected under the assumption that causal information flows should\nbe spatially localized. The tools developed herein are general and applicable\nto the inference and study of intercommunication networks in a wide variety of\nnatural settings.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01932v1', ['Populations and Evolution', 'Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'A multistate dynamic site occupancy model for spatially aggregated\n  sessile communities', ['Keiichi Fukaya', 'J. Andrew Royle', 'Takehiro Okuda', 'Masahiro Nakaoka', 'Takashi Noda'], u'2016-06-07', u'Markov community models have been applied to sessile organisms because such\nmodels facilitate estimation of transition probabilities by tracking species\noccupancy at many fixed observation points over multiple periods of time.\nEstimation of transition probabilities of sessile communities seems easy in\nprinciple but may still be difficult in practice because resampling error\n(i.e., a failure to resample exactly the same location at fixed points) may\ncause significant estimation bias. Previous studies have developed novel\nanalytical methods to correct for this estimation bias. However, they did not\nconsider the local structure of community composition induced by the aggregated\ndistribution of organisms that is typically observed in sessile assemblages and\nis very likely to affect observations. In this study, we developed a multistate\ndynamic site occupancy model to estimate transition probabilities that accounts\nfor resampling errors associated with local community structure. The model\napplies a nonparametric multivariate kernel smoothing methodology to the latent\noccupancy component to estimate the local state composition near each\nobservation point, which is assumed to determine the probability distribution\nof data conditional on the occurrence of resampling error. By using computer\nsimulations, we confirmed that an observation process that depends on local\ncommunity structure may bias inferences about transition probabilities. By\napplying the proposed model to a real dataset of intertidal sessile\ncommunities, we also showed that estimates of transition probabilities and of\nthe properties of community dynamics may differ considerably when spatial\ndependence is taken into account. Our approach can even accommodate an\nanisotropic spatial correlation of species composition, and may serve as a\nbasis for inferring complex nonlinear ecological dynamics.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02101v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'DNA-to-go: A portable smartphone-enabled PCR assay platform', ['Aashish Priye', 'Victor Ugaz'], u'2016-06-02', u'We address the need for affordable, rapid, and easy to use diagnostic\ntechnologies by coupling an innovative thermocycling system that harnesses\nnatural convection to perform rapid DNA amplification via the polymerase chain\nreaction (PCR) with smartphone-based detection. Our approach offers an\ninherently simple design that enables PCR to be completed in 10-20 minutes.\nElectrical power requirements are dramatically reduced by harnessing natural\nconvection to actuate the reaction, allowing the entire system to be operated\nfrom a standard USB connection (5 V) via solar battery packs.

[u'Run-and-tumble dynamics of cytoskeletal motor proteins', ['Anne E. Hafner', 'Ludger Santen', 'Heiko Rieger', 'M. Reza Shaebani'], u'2016-06-07', u'Cytoskeletal motor proteins are involved in major intracellular transport\nprocesses which are vital for maintaining appropriate cellular function. The\nmotor exhibits distinct states of motility: active motion along filaments, and\neffectively stationary phase in which it detaches from the filaments and\nperforms passive diffusion in the vicinity of the detachment point due to\ncytoplasmic crowding. The transition rates between motion and pause phases are\nasymmetric in general, and considerably affected by changes in environmental\nconditions which influences the efficiency of cargo delivery to specific\ntargets. By considering the motion of molecular motor on a single filament as\nwell as a dynamic filamentous network, we present an analytical model for the\ndynamics of self-propelled particles which undergo frequent pause phases. The\ninterplay between motor processivity, structural properties of filamentous\nnetwork, and transition rates between the two states of motility drastically\nchanges the dynamics: multiple transitions between different types of anomalous\ndiffusive dynamics occur and the crossover time to the asymptotic diffusive or\nballistic motion varies by several orders of magnitude. We map out the phase\ndiagrams in the space of transition rates, and address the role of initial\nconditions of motion on the resulting dynamics.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02191v1', ['Subcellular Processes'], []]
[u'Small-volume effect enables the spine robust, sensitive and efficient\n  information transfer', ['Masashi Fujii', 'Kaoru Ohashi', 'Yasuaki Karasawa', 'Minori Hikichi', 'Shinya Kuroda'], u'2016-06-07', u'Why is the spine of a neuron so small that only small numbers of molecules\ncan exist and reactions inevitably become stochastic? Despite such noisy\nconditions, we previously showed that the spine exhibits robust, sensitive and\nefficient features of information transfer using probability of Ca$^{2+}$\nincrease; however, their mechanisms remains unknown. Here we show that the\nsmall-volume effect enables robust, sensitive and efficient information\ntransfer in the spine volume, but not in the cell volume. In the spine volume,\nintrinsic noise in reactions becomes larger than extrinsic noise of input,\nmaking robust information transfer against input fluctuation. Stochastic\nfacilitation of Ca$^{2+}$ increase occurs in the spine volume, making higher\nsensitivity to lower intensity of input. Volume-dependency of information\ntransfer enables efficient information transfer per input in the spine volume.\nThus, we propose that the small-volume effect is the functional reasons why the\nspine has to be so small.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02084v1', ['Subcellular Processes'], []]

Luisa Iruela-Arispe', 'Yi Jiang'], u'2016-06-07', u'During angiogenesis, new blood vessels headed by a migrating endothelial tip\ncell sprout from pre-existing ones. This process is known to be regulated by\ntwo signaling pathways concurrently, vascular endothelial growth factor A\n(VEGFA) and Notch-Delta. Extracellular VEGFA activates the intracellular\nNotch-Delta pathway in nearby endothelial cells which results in endothelial\n(stalk, tip) differentiation. Retinal astrocytes appear to play a crucial role\nin polarizing new sprouts by secreting VEGFA. \\emph{In vivo} retinal\nangiogenesis experiments in neonatal mouse generated quantitative data on daily\ncell counts and morphological data of vascular network expanding over\nfibronectin-rich matrix. Based on this set of data and other existing ones, we\ndeveloped a cell-based, multiscale mathematical model using the cellular Potts\nmodel framework to investigate the sprout evolution by integrating the VEGFA\nand Notch-Delta signaling pathways. The model incorporates three levels of\ndescription: intracellular, intercellular, and extracellular. Starting with a\nsingle astrocyte embedded in a fibronectin-rich matrix, we use the model to\nassess different scenarios regarding VEGFA levels and its interaction with\nmatrix proteins. Simulation results suggest that astrocyte-derived VEGFA\ngradients along with heterogeneous ECM reproduces sprouting morphology, and the\nextension speed is in agreement with experimental data in 7 days postnatal\nmouse retina. Results also reproduce empirical observations in sprouting\nangiogenesis, including anastomosis, dynamic tip cell competition, and sprout\nregression as a result of Notch blockade.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02167v1', ['Cell Behavior'], []]
