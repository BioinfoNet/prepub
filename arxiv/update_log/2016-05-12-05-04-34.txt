[u'Increasing cognitive-emotional flexibility with meditation and hypnosis:\n  The cognitive neuroscience of de-automatization', ['Kieran C. R. Fox', 'Yoona Kang', 'Michael Lifshitz', 'Kalina Christoff'], u'2016-05-11', u'Meditation and hypnosis both aim to facilitate cognitive-emotional\nflexibility, i.e., the "de-automatization" of thought and behavior. However,\nlittle research or theory has addressed how internal thought patterns might\nchange after such interventions, even though alterations in the internal flow\nof consciousness may precede externally observable changes in behavior. This\nchapter outlines three mechanisms by which meditation or hypnosis might alter\nor reduce automatic associations and elaborations of spontaneous thought: by an\noverall reduction of the chaining of thoughts into an associative stream; by\nde-automatizing and diversifying the content of thought chains (i.e.,\nincreasing thought flexibility or variety); and, finally, by re-automatizing\nchains of thought along desired or valued paths (i.e., forming new, voluntarily\nchosen mental habits). The authors discuss behavioral and cognitive\nneuroscientific evidence demonstrating the influence of hypnosis and meditation\non internal cognition and highlight the putative neurobiological basis, as well\nas potential benefits, of these forms of de-automatization.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03553v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Quantifying spatial pattern similarity in multivariate analysis using\n  functional anisotropy', ['Roee Gilron', 'Jonathan Rosenblatt', 'Oluwasanmi Koyejo', 'Russell A. Poldrack', 'Roy Mukamel'], u'2016-05-11', u'Multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) has gained enormous popularity in the\nneuroimaging community over the past few years. At the group level, most MVPA\nstudies adopt an "information based" approach in which the sign of the effect\nof individual subjects is discarded and a non-directional summary statistic is\ncarried over to the second level. This is in contrast to a directional\n"activation based" approach which is typical in univariate group level\nanalysis, in which both signal magnitude and sign are taken into account. The\ntransition from examining effects in one voxel at a time vs. several voxels\n(univariate vs. multivariate) has thus tacitly entailed a transition from\ndirectional to non-directional signal definition at the group level. While a\ndirectional MVPA approach implies that individuals share multivariate spatial\npatterns of activity, in a non-directional approach each individual may have a\ndistinct spatial pattern of activity. Here we show using an experimental\ndataset that indeed directional and non-directional MVPA approaches uncover\ndistinct brain regions with some overlap. Moreover, we developed a descriptive\nmeasure to quantify the degree to which subjects share spatial patterns of\nactivity. Our approach is based on adapting the Fractional Anisotropy (FA)\nmeasure, originally developed for examining diffusion MRI signals, in a novel\nway to quantify the degree to which subjects share a spatial pattern of\nactivity. We term this measure "Functional Anisotropy" (FuA). Applying FuA to\nan auditory task, we found higher values in primary auditory regions compared\nto secondary and control regions. This highlights the potential of the FuA\nmeasure in second-level MVPA analysis to detect differences in the consistency\nof spatial patterns across subjects and their relationship to functional\ndomains in the brain.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03482v1', ['Neurons and Cognition', 'Quantitative Methods'], []]

The inverse problem of decoding,\nwhere the stimulus is reconstructed from spikes, has received less attention,\nin particular for complex input movies that should be reconstructed\n"pixel-by-pixel". We recorded around a hundred neurons from a dense patch in a\nrat retina and decoded movies of multiple small discs executing\nmutually-avoiding random motions. We constructed nonlinear (kernelized)\ndecoders that improved significantly over linear decoding results, mostly due\nto their ability to reliably separate between neural responses driven by\nlocally fluctuating light signals, and responses at locally constant light\ndriven by spontaneous or network activity. This improvement crucially depended\non the precise, non-Poisson temporal structure of individual spike trains,\nwhich originated in the spike-history dependence of neural responses. Our\nresults suggest a general paradigm in which downstream neural circuitry could\ndiscriminate between spontaneous and stimulus-driven activity on the basis of\nhigher-order statistical structure intrinsic to the incoming spike trains.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03373v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

Sharkey'], u'2016-05-11', u"We consider a generalised form of Karrer and Newman's (Phys. Rev. E 82,\n016101, 2010) message passing representation of S(E)IR dynamics and show that\nthis, and hence the original system of Karrer and Newman, has a unique feasible\nsolution. The rigorous bounds on the stochastic dynamics, and exact results for\ntrees, first obtained by Karrer and Newman, still hold in this more general\nsetting. We also derive an expression which provides a rigorous lower bound on\nthe variance of the number of susceptibles at any time for trees. By applying\nthe message passing approach to stochastic SIR dynamics on symmetric graphs, we\nthen obtain several key results. Firstly we obtain a low-dimensional message\npassing system comprising of only four equations. From this system, by assuming\nthat transmission processes are Poisson and independent of the recovery\nprocesses, we derive a non-Markovian pairwise model which gives exactly the\nsame infectious time series as the message passing system. Thus, this pairwise\nmodel provides the same rigorous bounds on the stochastic epidemic. Next we\nderive the classic non-Markovian epidemic model of Kermack and McKendrick\n(Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A 115, 700--721, 1927) as an asymptotic case of the\nmessage passing system. Finally, we analyse the low-dimensional message passing\nsystem to obtain results relating to its long-term behaviour, and implications\nfor the stochastic epidemic, and also state a theorem which addresses the\nintuitively understood idea that cycles in the graph tend to inhibit epidemics.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03555v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Simplification, innateness, and the absorption of meaning from context:\n  how novelty arises from gradual network evolution', ['Adi Livnat'], u'2016-05-11', u'The theory of interaction-based evolution argues that, at the most basic\nlevel of analysis, there is a third alternative for how adaptive evolution\nworks besides a) accidental mutation and natural selection and b) Lamarckism,\nnamely, c) information provided by natural selection on the fit between the\norganism and its environment is absorbed by non-accidental mutation. This\nnon-accidental mutation is non-Lamarckian yet useful for evolution, and is due\nto evolved and continually evolving mutational mechanisms operating in the germ\ncells. However, this theory has left a fundamental problem open: If mutational\nmechanisms are not Lamarckian---if they are not "aware" of the environment and\nthe macroscale phenotype---then how could heritable novelty be due to anything\nother than accidental mutation? This paper aims to address this question by\narguing the following. Mutational mechanisms can be broadly construed as\nenacting local simplification operations on the DNA in germ cells, along with\ngene duplication. The joint action of these mutational operations and natural\nselection provides simplification under performance pressure. This joint action\ncreates from preexisting biological interactions new elements that have the\ninherent capacity to come together into unexpected useful interactions with\nother such elements, thus explaining nature\'s tendency for cooption. Novelty\nthus arises not from a local genetic accident but from gradual network-level\nevolution. Many empirical observations are explained from this perspective,\nfrom cooption and gene fusion at the molecular level, to the evolution of\nbehavior and instinct at the organismal level. Finally, the nature of\nmutational mechanisms and the need to study them in detail are described, and a\nconnection is drawn between evolution and learning.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03440v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

[u'Forward Reachable Sets: Analytically derived properties of connected\n  components for dynamic networks', ['Benjamin Armbruster', 'Li Wang', 'Martina Morris'], u'2016-05-10', u'Formal analysis of the emergent structural properties of dynamic networks is\nlargely uncharted territory. We focus here on the properties of forward\nreachable sets (FRS) as a function of the underlying degree distribution and\nedge duration. FRS are defined as the set of nodes that can be reached from an\ninitial seed via a path of temporally ordered edges; a natural extension of\nconnected component measures to dynamic networks. Working in a stochastic\nframework, we derive closed-form expressions for the mean and variance of the\nexponential growth rate of the FRS for temporal networks with both edge and\nnode dynamics. For networks with node dynamics, we calculate thresholds for the\ngrowth of the FRS. The effects of finite population size are explored via\nsimulation and approximation. We examine how these properties vary by edge\nduration and different cross-sectional degree distributions that characterize a\nrange of scientifically interesting normative outcomes (Poisson and Bernoulli).\nThe size of the forward reachable set gives an upper bound for the epidemic\nsize in disease transmission network models, relating this work to epidemic\nmodeling (Ferguson 2000, Eames 2004).', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03241v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'eQTL mapping and inherited risk enrichment analysis : a systems biology\n  approach for coronary artery disease', ['Hassan Foroughi Asl'], u'2016-05-11', u'Despite extensive research during the last decades, coronary artery disease\n(CAD) remains the number one cause of death, responsible for near 50% of global\nmortality. A main reason for this is that CAD has a complex inheritance and\netiology that unlike rare single gene disorders cannot fully be understood from\nstudies of of genes one-by-one.In parallel, studies that simultaneously assess\nmultiple, functionally associated genes are warranted. For this reason we\nundertook the Stockholm Atherosclerosis Gene Expression (STAGE) study that\nbesides careful clinical characterization and genome-wide DNA genotyping also\nassessed the global gene expression profiles from seven CAD-relevant vascular\nand metabolic tissues. In this thesis report we show that by integrating GWAS\nwith genetics of gene expression studies like STAGE, we can advance our\nunderstanding from the perspective of multiple genes and gene variants acting\nin conjunction to cause CAD in the form of regulatory gene networks. This is\ndone through developing new bioinformatics tools and applying them to\ndisease-specific, genetics of global gene expression studies like STAGE. These\ntools are necessary to go beyond our current limited single-gene understanding\nof complex traits, like CAD.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03394v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u"What's the value in more moments?", ['Timothy Daley', 'Andrew D Smith'], u'2016-05-11', u'The moment-based non-parametric species richness estimator of Chao is one of\nthe most widely used estimators for the number of unobserved species in a\nsampling experiment. This is due in large part to its simplicity and\nrobustness. This simplicity can also be a drawback, as it only uses a small\namount of information contained in the observed experiment, essentially only\nthe first moment. Previous authors, specifically Harris and Chao, have\npresented a general moment-based framework for estimating species richness that\nincludes the Chao estimator. The application of this framework has been stymied\nby both the lack of deep sampling experiments, where higher moments can be\naccurately estimated, and the lack of efficient algorithms to properly use this\ninformation. Technological advances have filled the former void, allowing for\nsampling experiments orders of magnitude larger than previously considered. We\naim to address the latter by connecting results from the theory of moment\nspaces and Gaussian quadrature to provide a general moment-based non-parametric\nestimator of species richness that uses more information through more moments\nand is computationally efficient. We show this estimator performs well and\nimproves upon the Chao estimator on discrete abundance distributions, the\nsimplest cases of heterogeneity. We demonstrate the performance on a simulated\npopulations taken from emerging high-throughput technologies such as RNA-seq,\nimmune repertoire, and metagenomic sequencing.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03294v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Quantifying efficient information transduction of biochemical signaling\n  cascades', ['Tatsuaki Tsuruyama'], u'2016-05-11', u'Cells can be considered as systems that utilize changes in thermodynamic\nentropy as information. Therefore, they serve as useful models for\ninvestigating the relationships between entropy production and information\ntransmission, i.e., signal transduction. Based on the hypothesis that cells\napply a chemical reaction cascade for the most efficient transduction of\ninformation, we adopted a coding design that minimizes the number of bits per\nconcentration of molecules that are employed for information transduction. As a\nresult, the average rate of entropy production is uniform across all cycles in\na cascade reaction.

[u'Functional Characteristics of Gene Expression Motifs with Single and\n  Dual Strategies of Regulation', ['Mainak Pal', 'Sayantari Ghosh', 'Indrani Bose'], u'2016-05-11', u'Transcriptional regulation by transcription factors and post-transcriptional\nregulation by microRNAs constitute two major modes of regulation of gene\nexpression. While gene expression motifs incorporating solely transcriptional\nregulation are well investigated, the dynamics of motifs with dual strategies\nof regulation, i.e., both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation,\nhave not been studied as extensively. In this paper, we probe the dynamics of a\nfour-gene motif with dual strategies of regulation of gene expression. Some of\nthe functional characteristics are compared with those of a two-gene motif, the\ngenetic toggle, employing only transcriptional regulation. Both the motifs\ndefine positive feedback loops with the potential for bistability and\nhysteresis. The four-gene motif, contrary to the genetic toggle, is found to\nexhibit bistability even in the absence of cooperativity in the regulation of\ngene expression. The four-gene motif further exhibits a novel dynamical feature\nin which two regions of monostability with linear threshold response are\nseparated by a region of bistability with digital response.\n  Using the linear noise approximation (LNA), we further show that the\ncoefficient of variation (a measure of noise), associated with the protein\nlevels in the steady state, has a lower magnitude in the case of the four-gene\nmotif as compared to the case of the genetic toggle. We next compare\ntranscriptional with post-transcriptional regulation from an information\ntheoretic perspective. We focus on two gene expression motifs, Motif 1 with\ntranscriptional regulation and Motif 2 with post-transcriptional regulation.\n  We show that amongst the two motifs, Motif 2 has a greater capacity for\ninformation transmission for an extended range of parameter values.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03358v1', ['Molecular Networks', 'Cell Behavior'], []]
[u'Slip of grip of a molecular motor on a crowded track: Modeling shift of\n  reading frame of ribosome on RNA template', ['Bhavya Mishra', 'Gunter M. Schutz', 'Debashish Chowdhury'], u'2016-05-11', u'We develop a stochastic model for the programmed frameshift of ribosomes\nsynthesizing a protein while moving along a mRNA template. Normally the reading\nframe of a ribosome decodes successive triplets of nucleotides on the mRNA in a\nstep-by-step manner. We focus on the programmed shift of the ribosomal reading\nframe, forward or backward, by only one nucleotide which results in a fusion\nprotein; it occurs when a ribosome temporarily loses its grip to its mRNA\ntrack. Special "slippery" sequences of nucleotides and also downstream\nsecondary structures of the mRNA strand are believed to play key roles in\nprogrammed frameshift. Here we explore the role of an hitherto neglected\nparameter in regulating -1 programmed frameshift. Specifically, we demonstrate\nthat the frameshift frequency can be strongly regulated also by the density of\nthe ribosomes, all of which are engaged in simultaneous translation of the same\nmRNA, at and around the slippery sequence. Monte Carlo simulations support the\nanalytical predictions obtained from a mean-field analysis of the stochastic\ndynamics.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03434v1', ['Subcellular Processes'], []]
