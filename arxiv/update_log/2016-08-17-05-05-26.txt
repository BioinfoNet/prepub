[u'Synchronization dynamics on the picosecond timescale in coupled\n  Josephson junction neurons', ['Ken Segall', 'Matthew LeGro', 'Steven Kaplan', 'Oleksiy Svitelskiy', 'Shreeya Khadka', 'Patrick Crotty', 'Daniel Schult'], u'2016-08-16', u'Conventional digital computation is rapidly approaching physical limits for\nspeed and energy dissipation. Here we fabricate and test a simple neuromorphic\ncircuit that models neuronal somas, axons and synapses with superconducting\nJosephson junctions. Similar to biological neurons, two mutually-coupled\nJosephson junction neurons synchronize in one of two states, symmetric\n(in-phase) or anti-symmetric (anti-phase). The experimental alteration of the\ndelay and strength of the connecting synapses can toggle the system back and\nforth in a collective behavior known as a phase-flip bifurcation. Firing\nsynchronization states are calculated >70,000 times faster than conventional\ndigital approaches. With their speed and very low energy dissipation (10-17\nJoules/spike), Josephson junction neurons are now established as a viable\napproach for vast improvements in neuronal computation as well as applications\nin neuromorphic computing.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04680v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Dopamine modulation of prefrontal delay activity-reverberatory activity\n  and sharpness of tuning curves', ['Gabriele Scheler', 'Jean-Marc Fellous'], u'2016-08-16', u'Recent electrophysiological experiments have shown that dopamine (D1)\nmodulation of pyramidal cells in prefrontal cortex reduces spike frequency\nadaptation and enhances NMDA transmission. Using four models, from\nmulticompartmental to integrate and fire, we examine the effects of these\nmodulations on sustained (delay) activity in a reverberatory network. We find\nthat D1 modulation may enable robust network bistability yielding selective\nreverberation among cells that code for a particular item or location. We\nfurther show that the tuning curve of such cells is sharpened, and that\nsignal-to-noise ratio is increased. We postulate that D1 modulation affects the\ntuning of "memory fields" and yield efficient distributed dynamic\nrepresentations.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04540v1', ['Neurons and Cognition', 'Subcellular Processes'], []]
[u'HVC Interneuron Properties from Statistical Data Assimilation', ['Daniel Breen', 'Sasha Shirman', 'Eve Armstrong', 'Nirag Kadakia', 'Henry Abarbanel'], u'2016-08-15', u'Data assimilation (DA) solves the inverse problem of inferring initial\nconditions given data and a model. Here we use biophysically motivated\nHodgkin-Huxley (HH) models of avian HVCI neurons, experimentally obtained\nrecordings of these neurons, and our data assimilation algorithm to infer the\nfull set of parameters and a minimal set of ionic currents precisely\nreproducing the observed waveform information. We find many distinct validated\nsets of parameters selected by our DA method and choice of model. We conclude\nexploring variations on the inverse problem applied to neurons producing\naccurate or inaccurate results; by manipulating data presented to the\nalgorithm, varying sample rate and waveform; and by manipulating the model by\nadding and subtracting ionic currents.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04433v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Descision Making on Fitness Landscapes', ['Rudy Arthur', 'Paolo Sibani'], u'2016-08-16', u'We discuss fitness landscapes and how they can be modified to account for\nco-evolution. We are interested in using the landscape as a way to model\nrational decision making in a toy economic system. We develop a model very\nsimilar to the Tangled Nature Model of Christensen et. al. that we call the\nTangled Decision Model. This is a natural setting for our discussion of\nco-evolutionary fitness landscapes. We use a Monte Carlo step to simulate\ndecision making and investigate two different decision making procedures.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04568v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Persistence analysis of the age-structured population model on several\n  patches', ['Vladimir Kozlov', 'Sonja Radosavljevic', 'Vladimir G. Tkachev', 'Uno Wennergren'], u'2016-08-16', u'We consider a system of nonlinear partial differential equations that\ndescribes an age-structured population living in changing environment on $N$\npatches. We prove existence and uniqueness of solution and analyze large time\nbehavior of the system in time-independent case, for periodically changing and\nfor irregularly varying environment. Under the assumption that every patch can\nbe reached from every other patch, directly or through several intermediary\npatches, and that net reproductive operator has spectral radius larger than\none, we prove that population is persistent on all patches. If the spectral\nradius is less or equal one, extinction on all patches is imminent.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04492v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Stability of Equilibria in Modified-Gradient Systems', ['Benjamin J. Ridenhour', 'Jerry R. Ridenhour'], u'2016-08-15', u'Motivated by questions in biology, we investigate the stability of equilibria\nof the dynamical system $\\mathbf{x}^{\\prime}=P(t)\\nabla f(x)$ which arise as\ncritical points of $f$, under the assumption that $P(t)$ is positive\nsemi-definite. It is shown that the condition\n$\\int^{\\infty}\\lambda_{1}(P(t))~dt=\\infty$, where $\\lambda_{1}(P(t))$ is the\nsmallest eigenvalue of $P(t)$, plays a key role in guaranteeing uniform\nasymptotic stability and in providing information on the basis of attraction of\nthose equilibria.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04423v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'A Data-Driven Approach to Estimating the Number of Clusters in\n  Hierarchical Clustering', ['Antoine Zambelli'], u'2016-08-16', u'We propose two new methods for estimating the number of clusters in a\nhierarchical clustering framework in the hopes of creating a fully automated\nprocess with no human intervention. The methods are completely data-driven and\nrequire no input from the researcher, and as such are fully automated. They are\nquite easy to implement and not computationally intensive in the least. We\nanalyze performance on several simulated data sets and the Biobase Gene\nExpression Set, comparing our methods to the established Gap statistic and\nElbow methods and outperforming both in multi-cluster scenarios.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04700v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Influence of gene copy number on self-regulated gene expression', ['Jakub Jedrak', 'Anna Ochab-Marcinek'], u'2016-08-16', u'Using an analytically solvable stochastic model, we study the properties of a\nsimple genetic circuit consisting of multiple copies of an self-regulating\ngene. We analyse how the variation in gene copy number and the mutations\nchanging the auto-regulation strength affect the steady-state distribution of\nprotein concentration.\n  We predict that one-reporter assay, an experimental method where the\nextrinsic noise level is inferred from the comparison of expression variance of\na single and duplicated reporter gene, may give an incorrect estimation of the\nextrinsic noise contribution when applied to self-regulating genes.\n  We also show that an imperfect duplication of an auto-activated gene,\nchanging the regulation strength of one of the copies, may lead to a hybrid,\nbinary+graded response of these genes to external signal.\n  The analysis of relative changes in mean gene expression before and after\nduplication suggests that evolutionary accumulation of gene duplications may\nnon-trivially depend on the inherent noisiness of a given gene, quantified by\nmaximal mean frequency of bursts.\n  Moreover, we find that the dependence of gene expression noise on gene copy\nnumber and auto-regulation strength may qualitatively differ, e.g. in\nmonotonicity, depending on whether the noise is measured by Fano factor or\ncoefficient of variation. Thus, experimentally-based hypotheses linking gene\nexpression noise and evolutionary optimisation may be ambiguous as they are\ndependent on the particular function chosen to quantify noise.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04541v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
