[u'The neurobiology of self-generated thought from cells to systems:\n  Integrating evidence from lesion studies, human intracranial\n  electrophysiology, neurochemistry, and neuroendocrinology', ['Kieran C. R. Fox', 'Jessica R. Andrews-Hanna', 'Kalina Christoff'], u'2016-07-04', u'Investigation of the neural basis of self-generated thought is moving beyond\na simple identification with default network activation toward a more\ncomprehensive view recognizing the role of the frontoparietal control network\nand other areas. A major task ahead is to unravel the functional roles and\ntemporal dynamics of the widely distributed brain regions recruited during\nself-generated thought. We argue that various other neuroscientific methods -\nincluding lesion studies, human intracranial electrophysiology, and\nmanipulation of neurochemistry - have much to contribute to this project. These\ndiverse data have yet to be synthesized with the growing understanding of\nself-generated thought gained from neuroimaging, however. Here, we highlight\nseveral areas of ongoing inquiry and illustrate how evidence from other\nmethodologies corroborates, complements, and clarifies findings from functional\nneuroimaging. Each methodology has particular strengths: functional\nneuroimaging reveals much about the variety of brain areas and networks\nreliably recruited. Lesion studies point to regions critical to generating and\nconsciously experiencing self-generated thought. Human intracranial\nelectrophysiology illuminates how and where in the brain thought is generated\nand where this activity subsequently spreads. Finally, measurement and\nmanipulation of neurotransmitter and hormone levels can clarify what kind of\nneurochemical milieu drives or facilitates self-generated cognition.\nIntegrating evidence from multiple complementary modalities will be a critical\nstep on the way to improving our understanding of the neurobiology of\nfunctional and dysfunctional forms of self-generated thought.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01029v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

The role of white matter in this\ncoordination is poorly understood, nor is it easy to quantify how such\nstructure emerges across development. We use a network representation of\ndiffusion imaging data to show the optimization of white matter connectivity\nfor a diverse range of dynamics in 190 adults from ages 18 to 22. Such\noptimized topologies emerge across 882 youth from ages 8 to 22 evidencing\nincreasing local specialization. Notably, stable controllers in subcortical\nareas are negatively related to cognitive performance.

[u'Cholera forecast for Dhaka, Bangladesh, with the 2016 El Ni\xf1o', ['Pamela P. Martinez', 'Robert C. Reiner Jr.', 'Manojit Roy', 'Benjamin A. Cash', 'Md. Yunus', 'A. S. G. Faruque', 'Sayeeda Huq', 'Aaron A. King', 'Mercedes Pascual'], u'2016-07-04', u"A substantial body of work supports a teleconnection between the El Ni\\~no\nSouthern Oscillation (ENSO) and cholera incidence in Bangladesh. In particular,\nhigh positive anomalies during the winter (Dec-Feb) in Sea Surface Temperatures\n(SST) in the Tropical Pacific have been shown to exacerbate the seasonal\noutbreak of cholera following the monsoons from Aug to Nov, and climate studies\nhave indicated a role of regional precipitation over Bangladesh in mediating\nthis long-distance effect. Thus, the current strong El Ni\\~no has the potential\nto significantly increase cholera risk this year in Dhaka, Bangladesh, where\nthe last five years have experienced low seasons of the disease. To examine\nthis possibility and produce a forecast for the city, we considered two models\nfor the transmission dynamics of cholera: a statistical model previously\ndeveloped for the disease in this region, and a process-based model presented\nhere that includes the effect of SST anomalies in the force of infection and is\nfitted to extensive cholera surveillance record between 1995 and 2010.\nPrediction accuracy was evaluated with 'out-of-fit' data from the same\nsurveillance efforts, by comparing the total number of cholera cases observed\nfor the season to those predicted by model simulations 8 to 12 months ahead,\nstarting in January each year. Encouraged by accurate forecasts for the low\nrisk of cholera for this period, we then generated a prediction for this coming\nseason. An increase above the third quantile in cholera cases is expected for\nthe period of Aug - Dec 2016 with 92% and 87% probability respectively for the\ntwo models. This alert warrants the preparedness of the public health system.\nWe discuss the possible limitations of our approach, including variations in\nthe impact of El Ni\\~no events, and the importance of this large, warm event\nfor further informing an early-warning system for cholera in Dhaka", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01008v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Do dogs live in joint families? Understanding allo-parental care in\n  free-ranging dogs', ['Manabi Paul', 'Anindita Bhadra'], u'2016-07-05', u'Cooperative breeding is an excellent example of altruistic cooperation in\nsocial groups. Domestic dogs have evolved from cooperatively hunting and\nbreeding ancestors, but have adapted to a facultatively social scavenging\nlifestyle on streets, and solitary living in human homes. Pets typically breed\nand reproduce under human supervision, but free-ranging dogs can provide\ninsights into the natural breeding biology of dogs. We conducted a five year\nlong study on parental care of free-ranging dogs in India. We observed\nwidespread alloparenting by both adult males and females. Allomothers provided\nsignificantly less care that the mothers, but the putative fathers showed\ncomparable levels of care with the mothers. However, the nature of care varied;\nmothers invested more effort in feeding and allogrooming, while the putative\nfathers played and protected more. We were unsure of the relatedness of the\npups with the putative fathers, but all the allomothers were maternal relatives\nof the pups, which provides support for both the benefit-of-philopatry and\nassured fitness returns hypotheses. Free-ranging dogs are not cooperative\nbreeders like wolves, but are more similar to communal breeders. Their breeding\nbiology bears interesting similarities with the human joint family system.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01138v1', ['Other'], []]
[u'Clever mothers balance time and effort in parental care: a study on\n  free-ranging dogs', ['Manabi Paul', 'Shubhra Sau', 'Anjan K. Nandi', 'Anindita Bhadra'], u'2016-07-05', u'Mammalian offspring require parental care, at least in the form of suckling\nduring their early development. While mothers need to invest considerable time\nand energy in ensuring the survival of their current offspring, they also need\nto optimize their investment in one batch of offspring in order to ensure\nfuture reproduction and hence lifetime reproductive success. Free-ranging dogs\nlive in small social groups, mate promiscuously, and lack the cooperative\nbreeding biology of other group living canids. They face high early life\nmortality, which in turn reduces fitness benefits of the mother from a batch of\npups. We carried out a field based study on free-ranging dogs in India to\nunderstand the nature of parental care provided by mothers at different stages\nof pup development. Using behavioural patterns of mother-pup interactions, we\ndraw up a timeline of pup ontogeny. Our analysis reveals that mothers cleverly\nreduce investment in energy intensive active care and increase passive care as\nthe pups grow older, thereby keeping overall levels of parental care more or\nless constant over pup age.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01135v1', ['Other'], []]
[u'Minimum Message Length based Mixture Modelling using Bivariate von Mises\n  Distributions with Applications to Bioinformatics', ['Parthan Kasarapu'], u'2016-07-05', u"The modelling of empirically observed data is commonly done using mixtures of\nprobability distributions. In order to model angular data, directional\nprobability distributions such as the bivariate von Mises (BVM) is typically\nused. The critical task involved in mixture modelling is to determine the\noptimal number of component probability distributions. We employ the Bayesian\ninformation-theoretic principle of minimum message length (MML) to distinguish\nmixture models by balancing the trade-off between the model's complexity and\nits goodness-of-fit to the data. We consider the problem of modelling angular\ndata resulting from the spatial arrangement of protein structures using BVM\ndistributions. The main contributions of the paper include the development of\nthe mixture modelling apparatus along with the MML estimation of the parameters\nof the BVM distribution. We demonstrate that statistical inference using the\nMML framework supersedes the traditional methods and offers a mechanism to\nobjectively determine models that are of practical significance.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01312v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]

This technology measures impedance changes caused by the gradual increase\nof electrode surface occupation by cells during the course of time and provide\na Cell Index which is proportional to cellular morphology, spreading, ruffling\nand adhesion quality as well as cell number. In this paper we propose a\nmacroscopic mathematical model, based on \\emph{advection-reaction-diffusion}\npartial differential equations, describing the cell migration assay using the\nreal-time technology. We carried out numerical simulations to compare simulated\nmodel dynamics with data of observed biological experiments on three different\ncell lines and in two experimental settings: absence of chemotactic signals\n(basal migration) and presence of a chemoattractant.
