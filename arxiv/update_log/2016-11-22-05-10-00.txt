[u'3D Reconstruction of Heterogeneous Virus Particles with Statistical\n  Geometric Symmetry', ['Nan Xu', 'Peter C. Doershuck'], u'2016-11-21', u'In 3-D reconstruction problems, the image data obtained from cryo electron\nmicroscopy is the projection of many heterogeneous instances of the object\nunder study (e.g., a virus). When the object is heterogeneous but has an\noverall symmetry, it is natural to describe the object as stochastic with\nsymmetrical statistics. This paper presents a maximum likelihood reconstruction\napproach which allows each object to lack symmetry while constraining the {\\it\nstatistics} of the ensemble of objects to have symmetry. This algorithm is\ndemonstrated on bacteriophage HK97 and is contrasted with an existing algorithm\nin which each object, while still heterogeneous, has the symmetry.\nReconstruction results show that the proposed algorithm eliminates\nlong-standing distortions in previous heterogeneity calculations associated\nwith symmetry axes, and provides estimates that make more biologically sense\nthan the estimates of existing algorithms.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06618v1', ['Biomolecules', 'Quantitative Methods'], []]

Lichtman', 'Hanspeter Pfister'], u'2016-11-21', u'Reconstructing a synaptic wiring diagram, or connectome, from electron\nmicroscopy (EM) images of brain tissue currently requires many hours of manual\nannotation or proofreading (Kasthuri and Lichtman, 2010; Lichtman and Sanes,\n2008; Seung, 2009). The desire to reconstruct ever larger and more complex\nnetworks has pushed the collection of ever larger EM datasets. A cubic\nmillimeter of raw imaging data would take up 1 PB of storage and present an\nannotation project that would be impractical without relying heavily on\nautomatic segmentation methods. The RhoanaNet image processing pipeline was\ndeveloped to automatically segment large volumes of EM data and ease the burden\nof manual proofreading and annotation. Based on (Kaynig et al., 2015), we\nupdated every stage of the software pipeline to provide better throughput\nperformance and higher quality segmentation results. We used state of the art\ndeep learning techniques to generate improved membrane probability maps, and\nGala (Nunez-Iglesias et al., 2014) was used to agglomerate 2D segments into 3D\nobjects.\n  We applied the RhoanaNet pipeline to four densely annotated EM datasets, two\nfrom mouse cortex, one from cerebellum and one from mouse lateral geniculate\nnucleus (LGN). All training and test data is made available for benchmark\ncomparisons. The best segmentation results obtained gave\n$V^\\text{Info}_\\text{F-score}$ scores of 0.9054 and 09182 for the cortex\ndatasets, 0.9438 for LGN, and 0.9150 for Cerebellum.\n  The RhoanaNet pipeline is open source software.

[u'Using inspiration from synaptic plasticity rules to optimize traffic\n  flow in distributed engineered networks', ['Jonathan Y. Suen', 'Saket Navlakha'], u'2016-11-21', u'Controlling the flow and routing of data is a fundamental problem in many\ndistributed networks, including transportation systems, integrated circuits,\nand the Internet. In the brain, synaptic plasticity rules have been discovered\nthat regulate network activity in response to environmental inputs, which\nenable circuits to be stable yet flexible. Here, we develop a new\nneuro-inspired model for network flow control that only depends on modifying\nedge weights in an activity-dependent manner. We show how two fundamental\nplasticity rules (long-term potentiation and long-term depression) can be cast\nas a distributed gradient descent algorithm for regulating traffic flow in\nengineered networks. We then characterize, both via simulation and\nanalytically, how different forms of edge-weight update rules affect network\nrouting efficiency and robustness. We find a close correspondence between\ncertain classes of synaptic weight update rules derived experimentally in the\nbrain and rules commonly used in engineering, suggesting common principles to\nboth.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06937v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'A statistical model for brain networks inferred from large-scale\n  electrophysiological signals', ['Catalina Obando', 'Fabrizio De Vico Fallani'], u'2016-11-21', u'Network science has been extensively developed to characterize structural\nproperties of complex systems, including brain networks inferred from\nneuroimaging data. As a result of the inference process, networks estimated\nfrom experimentally obtained biological data, represent one instance of a\nlarger number of realizations with similar intrinsic topology. A modeling\napproach is therefore needed to support statistical inference on the bottom-up\nlocal connectivity mechanisms influencing the formation of the estimated brain\nnetworks. We adopted a statistical model based on exponential random graphs\n(ERG) to reproduce brain networks, or connectomes, estimated by spectral\ncoherence between high-density electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. We\nvalidated this approach in a dataset of 108 healthy subjects during eyes-open\n(EO) and eyes-closed (EC) resting-state conditions. Results showed that the\ntendency to form triangles and stars better explained the global properties of\nthe EEG connectomes as compared to other combinations of graph metrics. The\nsynthetic networks generated by this model configuration replicated the\ncharacteristic differences found in brain networks, with EO eliciting\nsignificantly higher segregation in the alpha band (8-13 Hz) as compared to EC.\nFurthermore, the fitted ERGM parameter values provided complementary\ninformation showing that triangle-like structures are significantly more\nrepresented in EO brain networks compared to EC in the alpha range, but also in\nthe beta band (14-29 Hz), which is known to play a crucial role in cortical\nprocessing of visual input and externally oriented attention. Taken together,\nthese findings support the current view of the brain functional integration and\nsegregation in terms of network hubs and modules, and provide a statistical\napproach to extract new information on the (re)organizational mechanisms in\nhealthy and diseased brains.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06893v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Differential response of the retinal neural code with respect to the\n  sparseness of natural images', ['Cesar Ravello', 'Maria-Jose Escobar', 'Adrian Palacios', 'Laurent Perrinet'], u'2016-11-21', u'Natural images follow statistics inherited by the structure of our physical\n(visual) environment. In particular, a prominent facet of this structure is\nthat images can be described by a relatively sparse number of features. To\ninvestigate the role of this sparseness in the efficiency of the neural code,\nwe designed a new class of random textured stimuli with a controlled sparseness\nvalue inspired by measurements of natural images. Then, we tested the impact of\nthis sparseness parameter on the firing pattern observed in a population of\nretinal ganglion cells recorded ex vivo in the retina of a rodent, the Octodon\ndegus. These recordings showed in particular that the reliability of spike\ntimings varies with respect to the sparseness with globally a similar trend\nthan the distribution of sparseness statistics observed in natural images.\nThese results suggest that the code represented in the spike pattern of\nganglion cells may adapt to this aspect of the statistics of natural images.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06834v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], [u'CINV', u'INT']]
[u'Rhythms of the collective brain: Metastable synchronization and\n  cross-scale interactions in connected multitudes', ['Miguel Aguilera'], u'2016-11-21', u'Collective social events operate at many levels of organization -- from\nindividuals to crowds -- presenting a variety of temporal and spatial scales of\nactivity, whose causal interactions challenge our understanding of social\nsystems. Large data sets of social media activity provide an unprecedented\nopportunity to investigate the processes that govern the coordination within\nand between those scales. Using as a case study a data set comprising 1.5\nmillion Twitter messages of the activity around the 15M movement in Spain as an\nexample of multitudinous self-organization, we propose a generic description of\nthe coordination dynamics of the system based on phase-locking statistics at\ndifferent frequencies using wavelet functions, identifying 8 frequency bands of\nentrained oscillations between 15 geographical urban nodes. We apply maximum\nentropy inference methods to extract Ising models capturing phase-locking\nactivity between geographical nodes in our data at each frequency band.\nInspecting the properties of the resulting models for each frequency we show\nthat 1) all frequency bands of the system are operating in a regime of\ncriticality and 2) while fast frequencies present only a few metastable states\ndisplaying all-or-none synchronization, slow frequencies present a variety of\nmetastable states displaying distinct modes of partial synchronization.\nFurthermore, describing states of coordination at each frequency using the\nenergy function inferred for each Ising model, we use symbolic transfer entropy\nto characterize cross-scale interactions between frequency bands, showing 1) a\ncascade of upward information flows in which each frequency band influences its\ncontiguous slower frequency bands and 2) downward information flows where slow\nfrequencies modulate distant fast frequencies.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06831v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

Understanding the population\ndynamics of MRSA through modeling is essential to identify the causal\nmechanisms driving the epidemics and to generalize conclusions to different\ncontexts. We develop an innovative high-resolution spatiotemporal contact\nnetwork model of interactions between patients to reproduce the hospital\npopulation in the context of the Stockholm County in Sweden and simulate the\nspread of MRSA within this population. Our model captures the spatial and\ntemporal heterogeneity caused by human behavior and by the dynamics of mobility\nwithin wards and hospitals. We estimate that in this population the epidemic\nthreshold is at about 0.008. We also identify that these heterogeneous contact\npatterns cause the emergence of super-spreader patients and a polynomial growth\nof the epidemic curve. We finally study the effect of standard intervention\ncontrol strategies and identify that screening is more effective than improved\nhygienic in order to cause smaller or null outbreaks.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06784v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
