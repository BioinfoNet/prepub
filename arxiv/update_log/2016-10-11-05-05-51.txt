[u'Finding dominant transition pathways via global optimization of action', ['Juyong Lee', 'In-Ho Lee', 'InSuk Joung', 'Jooyoung Lee', 'Bernard R. Brooks'], u'2016-10-09', u'We present a new computational approach, Action-CSA, to sample multiple\nreaction pathways with fixed initial and final states through global\noptimization of the Onsager-Machlup action using the conformational space\nannealing method. This approach successfully samples not only the most dominant\npathway but also many other possible paths without initial guesses on reaction\npathways. Pathway space is efficiently sampled by crossover operations of a set\nof paths and preserving the diversity of sampled pathways. The sampling ability\nof the approach is assessed by finding pathways for the conformational changes\nof alanine dipeptide and hexane. The benchmarks demonstrate that the rank order\nand the transition time distribution of multiple pathways identified by the new\napproach are in good agreement with those of long molecular dynamics\nsimulations. We also show that the lowest action folding pathway of the\nmini-protein FSD-1 identified by the new approach is consistent with previous\nmolecular dynamics simulations and experiments.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02652v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Exploring brain transcriptomic patterns: a topological analysis using\n  spatial expression networks', ['Zhana Kuncheva', 'Michelle L. Krishnan', 'Giovanni Montana'], u'2016-10-08', u"Characterizing the transcriptome architecture of the human brain is\nfundamental in gaining an understanding of brain function and disease. A number\nof recent studies have investigated patterns of brain gene expression obtained\nfrom an extensive anatomical coverage across the entire human brain using\nexperimental data generated by the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA) project. In\nthis paper, we propose a new representation of a gene's transcription activity\nthat explicitly captures the pattern of spatial co-expression across different\nanatomical brain regions. For each gene, we define a Spatial Expression Network\n(SEN), a network quantifying co-expression patterns amongst several anatomical\nlocations. Network similarity measures are then employed to quantify the\ntopological resemblance between pairs of SENs and identify naturally occurring\nclusters. Using network-theoretical measures, three large clusters have been\ndetected featuring distinct topological properties. We then evaluate whether\ntopological diversity of the SENs reflects significant differences in\nbiological function through a gene ontology analysis. We report on evidence\nsuggesting that one of the three SEN clusters consists of genes specifically\ninvolved in the nervous system, including genes related to brain disorders,\nwhile the remaining two clusters are representative of immunity, transcription\nand translation. These findings are consistent with previous studies showing\nthat brain gene clusters are generally associated with one of these three major\nbiological processes.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02548v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Honing Theory: A Complex Systems Framework for Creativity', ['Liane Gabora'], u'2016-10-08', u'This paper proposes a theory of creativity, referred to as honing theory,\nwhich posits that creativity fuels the process by which culture evolves through\ncommunal exchange amongst minds that are self-organizing, self-maintaining, and\nself-reproducing. According to honing theory, minds, like other selforganizing\nsystems, modify their contents and adapt to their environments to minimize\nentropy. Creativity begins with detection of high psychological entropy\nmaterial, which provokes uncertainty and is arousalinducing. The creative\nprocess involves recursively considering this material from new contexts until\nit is sufficiently restructured that arousal dissipates. Restructuring involves\nneural synchrony and dynamic binding, and may be facilitated by temporarily\nshifting to a more associative mode of thought. A creative work may similarly\ninduce restructuring in others, and thereby contribute to the cultural\nevolution of more nuanced worldviews. Since lines of cultural descent\nconnecting creative outputs may exhibit little continuity, it is proposed that\ncultural evolution occurs at the level of self-organizing minds, outputs\nreflect their evolutionary state. Honing theory addresses challenges not\naddressed by other theories of creativity, such as the factors that guide\nrestructuring, and in what sense creative works evolve. Evidence comes from\nempirical studies, an agent-based computational model of cultural evolution,\nand a model of concept combination.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02484v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

[u'A Music-generating System Inspired by the Science of Complex Adaptive\n  Systems', ['Shawn Bell', 'Liane Gabora'], u'2016-10-08', u"This paper presents NetWorks (NW), an interactive music generation system\nthat uses a hierarchically clustered scale free network to generate music that\nranges from orderly to chaotic. NW was inspired by the Honing Theory of\ncreativity, according to which human-like creativity hinges on (1) the ability\nto self-organize and maintain dynamics at the 'edge of chaos' using something\nakin to 'psychological entropy', and (2) the capacity to shift between analytic\nand associative processing modes. At the 'edge of chaos', NW generates patterns\nthat exhibit emergent complexity through coherent development at low, mid, and\nhigh levels of musical organization, and often suggests goal seeking behaviour.\nThe architecture consists of four 16-node modules: one each for pitch,\nvelocity, duration, and entry delay. The Core allows users to define how nodes\nare connected, and rules that determine when and how nodes respond to their\ninputs. The Mapping Layer allows users to map node output values to MIDI data\nthat is routed to software instruments in a digital audio workstation. By\nshifting between bottom-up and top-down NW shifts between analytic and\nassociative processing modes.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02475v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'The Creative Process in Musical Composition: An Introspective Account', ['Liane Gabora'], u'2016-10-08', u"This chapter charts the creative process in the composition of a piece of\nmusic titled 'Stream not gone dry' that unfolded, while I was primarily\noccupied with other matters, over the course of nearly two decades. It avoids\ndiscussion of the technical aspects of musical composition, and it can be read\nby someone with no formal knowledge of music. The focus here is on what the\nprocess of composing this particular piece of music says about how the creative\nprocess works. My interpretation of the music-making process may be biased by\nmy academic view of creativity, but I believe that the influence works\nprimarily in the other direction, my understanding of how the creative process\nworks is derived from experiences creating. This intuitive understanding is\nshaped over time by the process of reading scholarly papers on creativity and\nworking them into my own evolving theory of creativity, but the papers that I\nresonate with and incorporate are those that are in line with my experience.\nThis chapter just makes the influence of personal experience more explicit than\nin other more scholarly writings on creativity.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02471v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Causal-order superposition as an enabler of free will', ['Salvador Malo'], u'2016-10-08', u'It is often argued that bottom-up causation under a physicalist, reductionist\nworldview precludes free will in the libertarian sense. On the one hand, the\nparadigm of classical mechanics makes determinism inescapable, while on the\nother, the leading models that allow a role for quantum effects are\nnoncommittal regarding how conscious agents are supposed to translate\nindeterminacy into self-formed choice. Recent developments, however, not only\nimply that self-formed decisions are possible, but actually suggest how they\nmight come about. The cornerstone appears to be causality superposition rather\nthan quantum-state entanglement, as is usually assumed, and the natural arena\nfor applying these developments is (perhaps ironically) a framework that was\nbuilt without any consideration for quantum effects.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02395v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Evolution of new regulatory functions on biophysically realistic fitness\n  landscapes', ['Tamar Friedlander', 'Roshan Prizak', 'Nicholas H. Barton', 'Gasper Tkacik'], u'2016-10-10', u'Regulatory networks consist of interacting molecules with a high degree of\nmutual chemical specificity. How can these molecules evolve when their function\ndepends on maintenance of interactions with cognate partners and simultaneous\navoidance of deleterious "crosstalk" with non-cognate molecules? Although\nphysical models of molecular interactions provide a framework in which\nco-evolution of network components can be analyzed, most theoretical studies\nhave focused on the evolution of individual alleles, neglecting the network. In\ncontrast, we study the elementary step in the evolution of gene regulatory\nnetworks: duplication of a transcription factor followed by selection for TFs\nto specialize their inputs as well as the regulation of their downstream genes.\nWe show how to coarse grain the complete, biophysically realistic\ngenotype-phenotype map for this process into macroscopic functional outcomes\nand quantify the probability of attaining each. We determine which evolutionary\nand biophysical parameters bias evolutionary trajectories towards fast\nemergence of new functions and show that this can be greatly facilitated by the\navailability of "promiscuity-promoting" mutations that affect TF specificity.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02864v1', ['Populations and Evolution', 'Molecular Networks'], []]
[u'Synchronized and mixed outbreaks of coupled recurrent epidemics', ['Muhua Zheng', 'Ming Zhao', 'Byungjoon Min', 'Zonghua Liu'], u'2016-10-08', u'Epidemic spreading has been studied for a long time and most of them are\nfocused on the growing aspect of a single epidemic outbreak. Recently, we\nextended the study to the case of recurrent epidemics (Sci. Rep. {\\bf 5}, 16010\n(2015)) but limited only to a single network. We here report from the real data\nof coupled regions or cities that the recurrent epidemics in two coupled\nnetworks are closely related to each other and can show either synchronized\noutbreak phase where outbreaks occur simultaneously in both networks or mixed\noutbreak phase where outbreaks occur in one network but do not in another one.\nTo reveal the underlying mechanism, we present a two-layered network model of\ncoupled recurrent epidemics to reproduce the synchronized and mixed outbreak\nphases. We show that the synchronized outbreak phase is preferred to be\ntriggered in two coupled networks with the same average degree while the mixed\noutbreak phase is preferred for the case with different average degrees.\nFurther, we show that the coupling between the two layers is preferred to\nsuppress the mixed outbreak phase but enhance the synchronized outbreak phase.\nA theoretical analysis based on microscopic Markov-chain approach is presented\nto explain the numerical results. This finding opens a new window for studying\nthe recurrent epidemics in multi-layered networks.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02528v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'A topological approach to the problem of emergence in complex systems', ['Alberto Pascual-Garcia'], u'2016-10-07', u'Emergent patterns in complex systems are related to many intriguing phenomena\nin modern science and philosophy. Several conceptions such as weak, strong and\nrobust emergence have been proposed to emphasize different epistemological and\nontological aspects of the problem. One of the most important concerns is\nwhether emergence is an intrinsic property of the reality we observe, or it is\nrather a consequence of epistemological limitations. To elucidate this\nquestion, we propose a novel approximation through constructive topology, a\nframework that allow us to map the space of observed objects (ontology) with\nthe knowledge subject conceptual apparatus (epistemology). Focusing in a\nparticular type of emergent processes, namely those accessible through\nexperiments and from which we have still no clue on the mechanistic processes\nyielding its formation, we analyse how a knowledge subject would build a\nconceptual explanatory framework. Working on these systems, we identify concept\ndisjunction as a critical logical operation needed to identify the constraints\nof the system. Next, focusing on a three-bits synthetic system, we show how the\nnumber and scope of the constraints hinder the development of such scheme.\nInterestingly, we observe that our framework is unable to identify global\nconstraints, clearly linking the epistemological limits of the framework with\nan ontological feature of the system. This allows us to propose a definition of\nemergence strength which we make compatible with the scientific method through\nthe active intervention of the observer on the system. We think that this\ndefinition reconciles previous attempts to classify emergent processes, at\nleast for the specific kind we discuss here. The paper finishes discussing the\nrelevance of global constraints in biological systems, understood as a downward\ncausal influence exerted by natural selection.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02448v1', ['Other'], []]
[u'Perspectives on the mathematics of biological patterning and\n  morphogenesis', ['Krishna Garikipati'], u'2016-10-08', u'A central question in developmental biology is how size and position are\ndetermined. The genetic code carries instructions on how to control these\nproperties in order to regulate the pattern and morphology of structures in the\ndeveloping organism. Transcription and protein translation mechanisms implement\nthese instructions. However, this cannot happen without some manner of sampling\nof epigenetic information on the current patterns and morphological forms of\nstructures in the organism. Any rigorous description of space- and time-varying\npatterns and morphological forms reduces to one among various classes of\nspatio-temporal partial differential equations. Reaction-transport equations\nrepresent one such class. Starting from simple Fickian diffusion, the\nincorporation of reaction, phase segregation and advection terms can represent\nmany of the patterns seen in the animal and plant kingdoms. Morphological form,\nrequiring the development of three-dimensional structure, also can be\nrepresented by these equations of mass transport, albeit to a limited degree.\nThe recognition that physical forces play controlling roles in shaping tissues\nleads to the conclusion that (nonlinear) elasticity governs the development of\nmorphological form. In this setting, inhomogeneous growth drives the elasticity\nproblem. The combination of reaction-transport equations with those of\nelasto-growth makes accessible a potentially unlimited spectrum of patterning\nand morphogenetic phenomena in developmental biology. This perspective\ncommunication is a survey of the partial differential equations of mathematical\nphysics that have been proposed to govern patterning and morphogenesis in\ndevelopmental biology. Several numerical examples are included to illustrate\nthese equations and the corresponding physics, with the intention of providing\nphysical insight wherever possible.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02584v1', ['Tissues and Organs', 'Cell Behavior'], []]

[u'Flexible Dynamics of Two Quorum Sensing Coupled Repressilators', ['Edward H. Hellen', 'Evgeny Volkov'], u'2016-10-07', u'Genetic oscillators play important roles in cell life regulation. The\nregulatory efficiency usually depends strongly on the emergence of stable\ncollective dynamic modes, which requires designing the interactions between\ngenetic networks. We investigate the dynamics of two identical synthetic\ngenetic repressilators coupled by an additional plasmid which implements quorum\nsensing (QS) in each network thereby supporting global coupling. In a basic\ngenetic ring oscillator network in which three genes inhibit each other in\nunidirectional manner, QS stimulates the transcriptional activity of chosen\ngenes providing for competition between inhibitory and stimulatory activities\nlocalized in those genes. The "promoter strength", the Hill cooperativity\ncoefficient of transcription repression, and the coupling strength, i.e.,\nparameters controlling the basic rates of genetic reactions, were chosen for\nextensive bifurcation analysis. The results are presented as a map of dynamic\nregimes. We found that the remarkable multistability of the anti-phase limit\ncycle and stable homogeneous and inhomogeneous steady states exists over broad\nranges of control parameters. We studied the anti-phase limit cycle stability\nand the evolution of irregular oscillatory regimes in the parameter areas where\nthe anti-phase cycle loses stability. In these regions we observed developing\ncomplex oscillations, collective chaos, and multistability between regular\nlimit cycles and complex oscillations over uncommonly large intervals of\ncoupling strength. QS-coupling stimulates the appearance of intrachaotic\nperiodic windows with spatially symmetric and asymmetric partial limit cycles\nwhich, in turn, change the type of chaos from a simple anti-phase character\ninto chaos composed of pieces of the trajectories having alternating polarity.\nAbstract truncated...', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02440v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
