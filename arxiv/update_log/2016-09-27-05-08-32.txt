[u'Universal bound on the efficiency of molecular motors', ['Patrick Pietzonka', 'Andre C. Barato', 'Udo Seifert'], u'2016-09-26', u'The thermodynamic uncertainty relation provides an inequality relating any\nmean current, the associated dispersion and the entropy production rate for\narbitrary non-equilibrium steady states. Applying it here to a general model of\na molecular motor running against an external force or torque, we show that the\nthermodynamic efficiency of such motors is universally bounded by an expression\ninvolving only experimentally accessible quantities. For motors pulling cargo\nthrough a viscous fluid, a universal bound for the corresponding Stokes\nefficiency follows as a variant. A similar result holds if mechanical force is\nused to synthesize molecules of high chemical potential. Crucially, no\nknowledge of the detailed underlying mechano-chemical mechanism is required for\napplying these bounds.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08046v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Free Energy Landscape of GAGA and UUCG RNA Tetraloops', ['Sandro Bottaro', 'Pavel Banas', 'Jiri Sponer', 'Giovanni Bussi'], u'2016-09-26', u'We report the folding thermodynamics of ccUUCGgg and ccGAGAgg RNA tetraloops\nusing atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. We obtain a previously\nunreported estimation of the folding free energy using parallel tempering in\ncombination with well-tempered metadynamics. A key ingredient is the use of a\nrecently developed metric distance, eRMSD, as a biased collective variable. We\nfind that the native fold of both tetraloops is not the global free energy\nminimum using the Amber\\c{hi}OL3 force field. The estimated folding free\nenergies are 30.2kJ/mol for UUCG and 7.5 kJ/mol for GAGA, in striking\ndisagreement with experimental data. We evaluate the viability of all possible\none-dimensional backbone force field corrections. We find that disfavoring the\ngauche+ region of {\\alpha} and {\\zeta} angles consistently improves the\nexisting force field. The level of accuracy achieved with these corrections,\nhowever, cannot be considered sufficient by judging on the basis of available\nthermodynamic data and solution experiments.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07898v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'In vivo compaction dynamics of bacterial DNA: A fingerprint of DNA/RNA\n  demixing ?', ['Marc Joyeux'], u'2016-09-26', u'The volume occupied by unconstrained bacterial DNA in physiological solutions\nexceeds 1000 times the volume of the cell. Still, it is confined to a well\ndefined region of the cell called the nucleoid, which occupies only a fraction\nof the cell volume. There is still no general agreement on the mechanism\nleading to the compaction of the DNA and the formation of the nucleoid.\nHowever, advances in in vivo sub-wavelength resolution microscopy techniques\nhave recently allowed the observation of the nucleoid at an unprecedented level\nof detail. In particular, these observations show that the compaction of the\nnucleoid is not static but is instead a highly dynamic feature, which depends\non several factors, like the richness of the nutrient, the cell cycle stage,\ntemperature, the action of an osmotic shock or antibiotics, etc. After a short\ndescription of the electrolyte content of the cytosol and a brief overview of\nthe different mechanisms that may lead to the formation of the nucleoid, this\npaper reviews some of the most fascinating recent results of in vivo\nsub-wavelength resolution microscopy. It is furthermore argued that these\nobservations provide converging indications in favor of a model that describes\nthe cytosol as an aqueous electrolyte solution containing several\nmacromolecular species, where demixing and segregative phase separation occur\nbetween DNA and RNA (essentially rRNA and mRNA involved in translation\ncomplexes, but also the large amounts of rRNA synthesized at the rrn operons of\ncells growing in rich media). It is also pointed out that crowding may play a\ncrucial role through its synergy with electrostatic forces. By constraining\nmacromolecules to remain at short distances from one another and feel\nelectrostatic interactions in spite of the strong screening exerted by\nelectrolyte species, crowding favors stronger DNA/RNA demixing and nucleoid\ncompaction.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07892v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]

Reiner'], u'2016-09-26', u"The neural basis of human memory is incredibly complex. We argue that the\ndiversity of neural systems underlying various forms of memory suggests that\nany discussion of enhancing 'memory' per se is too broad, thus obfuscating the\nbiopolitical debate about human enhancement. Memory can be differentiated into\nat least four major (and several minor) systems with largely dissociable (i.e.,\nnon-overlapping) neural substrates. We outline each system, and discuss both\nthe practical and the ethical implications of these diverse neural substrates.\nIn practice, distinct neural bases imply the possibility, and likely the\nnecessity, of specific approaches for the safe and effective enhancement of\nvarious memory systems. In the debate over the ethical and social implications\nof enhancement technologies, this fine-grained perspective clarifies - and may\npartially mitigate - certain common concerns in enhancement debates, including\nissues related to safety, fairness, coercion, and authenticity. While many\nresearchers certainly appreciate the neurobiological complexity of memory, the\npolitical debate tends to revolve around a monolithic one-size-fits-all\nconception.

Nathan Kutz'], u'2016-09-24', u"Neurodegenerative diseases and traumatic brain injuries (TBI) are among the\nmain causes of cognitive dysfunction in humans. Both manifestations exhibit the\nextensive presence of focal axonal swellings (FAS). FAS compromises the\ninformation encoded in spike trains, thus leading to potentially severe\nfunctional deficits. Complicating our understanding of the impact of FAS is our\ninability to access small scale injuries with non-invasive methods, the overall\ncomplexity of neuronal pathologies, and our limited knowledge of how networks\nprocess biological signals. Building on Hopfield's pioneering work, we extend a\nmodel for associative memory to account for FAS and its impact on memory\nencoding. We calibrate all FAS parameters from biophysical observations of\ntheir statistical distribution and size, providing a framework to simulate the\neffects of brain disorders on memory recall performance. A face recognition\nexample is used to demonstrate and validate the functionality of the novel\nmodel. Our results link memory recall ability to observed FAS statistics,\nallowing for a description of different stages of brain disorders within\nneuronal networks. This provides a first theoretical model to bridge\nexperimental observations of FAS in neurodegeneration and TBI with compromised\nmemory recall, thus closing the large gap between theory and experiment on how\nbiological signals are processed in damaged, high-dimensional functional\nnetworks.

We explicitly consider the self\nvolume of the prey restraining their dynamics on the lattice. The movement of\nboth predator and prey is chosen to include an intelligent, decision making\nstep based on their respective sighting ranges, the radius in which they can\ndetect the other species (prey cannot recognise each other besides the self\nvolume interaction): after spotting each other the motion of prey and predator\nturns from a nearest neighbour random walk into direct escape or chase,\nrespectively. We consider a large range of prey densities and sighting ranges\nand compute the mean first passage time for a predator to catch a prey as well\nas characterise the effective dynamics of the hunted prey. We find that the\nprey's sighting range dominates their life expectancy and the predator profits\nmore from a bad eyesight of the prey than from his own good eye sight. We\ncharacterise the dynamics in terms of the mean distance between the predator\nand the nearest prey. It turns out that effectively the dynamics of this\ndistance coordinate can be captured in terms of a simple Ornstein-Uhlenbeck\npicture. Reducing the many-body problem to a simple two-body problem by\nimagining predator and nearest prey to be connected by a Hookean bond, all\nfeatures of the model such as prey density and sighting ranges merge into the\neffective binding constant.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07855v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

This raises the question of whether stable\ncooperation can form despite an intrinsically fragmented social fabric. Here we\ndevelop a framework to study the evolution of cooperation on temporal networks\nin the setting of the classic Prisoner's Dilemma. By analyzing both real and\nsynthetic datasets, we find that temporal networks generally facilitate the\nevolution of cooperation compared to their static counterparts. More\ninterestingly, we find that the intrinsic human interactive pattern like bursty\nbehavior impedes the evolution of cooperation.

It is however challenging to assay large number (>3) of signaling\nspecies in live-cell imaging which makes it difficult to probe single cell\nsignaling kinetic trajectories in large dimensions. Flow and mass cytometry\ntechniques can measure a large number (4 - >40) of signaling species but are\nunable to track single cells. Thus cytometry experiments provide detailed time\nstamped snapshots of single cell signaling kinetics. Is it possible to use the\ntime stamped cytometry data to reconstruct single cell signaling trajectories?\nBorrowing concepts of conserved and slow variables from non-equilibrium\nstatistical physics we develop an approach to reconstruct signaling\ntrajectories using snapshot data by creating new variables that remain\ninvariant or vary slowly during the signaling kinetics. We apply this approach\nto reconstruct trajectories using snapshot data obtained from in silico\nsimulations and live-cell imaging measurements. The use of invariants and slow\nvariables to reconstruct trajectories provides a radically different way to\ntrack object using snapshot data. The approach is likely to have implications\nfor solving matching problems in a wide range of disciplines.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08035v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]

Thus, transcriptional gene-regulation is often\ncontrolled by poorly expressed transcription-factors, such as E.coli lac\nrepressor with few tens of copies. Here we study the effects of inherent\nconcentration fluctuations of substrate-molecules on the seminal\nMichaelis-Menten scheme of biochemical reactions. We present a universal\ncorrection to the Michaelis-Menten equation for the reaction-rates. The\nrelevance and validity of this correction for enzymatic reactions and\nintracellular gene-regulation is demonstrated. Our analytical theory and\nsimulation results confirm that the proposed variance-corrected\nMichaelis-Menten equation predicts the rate of reactions with remarkable\naccuracy even in the presence of large non-equilibrium concentration\nfluctuations.

The variables are averaged at the regional scale over ten Arctic\nbiogeographic zones and treated as input matrices at four vertical habitat\nlevels. Nutrient-light-salt limited ice algal growth is computed along with the\nassociated grazing plus mortality. Vertical transport is diffusive but responds\nto pore structure. Simulated bottom layer chlorophyll maxima are reasonable,\nthough delayed by about a month relative to observations. This highlights major\nuncertainties deriving from snow thickness variability.

The growth\nrate of the precipitate is found to be proportional to the square root of time,\nwhich is characteristic of diffusive transport. However, the dependence of the\ngrowth rate on the concentrations of hydroxide and metal ions is approximately\nlinear and quadratic, respectively. We show that such a difference in ionic\ntransport dynamics arises from the enhanced transport of metal ions across a\nthin gel layer present at the surface of the precipitate. The fluctuations in\ntransverse velocity in this wavy porous gel layer allow an enhanced transport\nof the cation, so that the effective diffusivity is about an order of magnitude\nhigher than that expected from molecular diffusion alone.
