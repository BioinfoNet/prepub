[u'Interpretable Nonlinear Dynamic Modeling of Neural Trajectories', ['Yuan Zhao', 'Il Memming Park'], u'2016-08-23', u'A central challenge in neuroscience is understanding how neural system\nimplements computation through its dynamics. We propose a nonlinear time series\nmodel aimed at characterizing interpretable dynamics from neural trajectories.\nOur model assumes low-dimensional continuous dynamics in a finite volume. It\nincorporates a prior assumption about globally contractional dynamics to avoid\noverly enthusiastic extrapolation outside of the support of observed\ntrajectories. We show that our model can recover qualitative features of the\nphase portrait such as attractors, slow points, and bifurcations, while also\nproducing reliable long-term future predictions in a variety of dynamical\nmodels and in real neural data.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06546v1', ['Neurons and Cognition', 'Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'LFADS - Latent Factor Analysis via Dynamical Systems', ['David Sussillo', 'Rafal Jozefowicz', 'L. F.

Currently, there is little\nconsensus on how such data should be analyzed. Here we introduce LFADS (Latent\nFactor Analysis via Dynamical Systems), a method to infer latent dynamics from\nsimultaneously recorded, single-trial, high-dimensional neural spiking data.\nLFADS is a sequential model based on a variational auto-encoder. By making a\ndynamical systems hypothesis regarding the generation of the observed data,\nLFADS reduces observed spiking to a set of low-dimensional temporal factors,\nper-trial initial conditions, and inferred inputs. We compare LFADS to existing\nmethods on synthetic data and show that it significantly out-performs them in\ninferring neural firing rates and latent dynamics.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06315v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Fundamental principles of cortical computation: unsupervised learning\n  with prediction, compression and feedback', ['Micah Richert', 'Dimitry Fisher', 'Filip Piekniewski', 'Eugene M. Izhikevich', 'Todd L. Hylton'], u'2016-08-19', u'There has been great progress in understanding of anatomical and functional\nmicrocircuitry of the primate cortex. However, the fundamental principles of\ncortical computation - the principles that allow the visual cortex to bind\nretinal spikes into representations of objects, scenes and scenarios - have so\nfar remained elusive. In an attempt to come closer to understanding the\nfundamental principles of cortical computation, here we present a functional,\nphenomenological model of the primate visual cortex. The core part of the model\ndescribes four hierarchical cortical areas with feedforward, lateral, and\nrecurrent connections. The three main principles implemented in the model are\ninformation compression, unsupervised learning by prediction, and use of\nlateral and top-down context. We show that the model reproduces key aspects of\nthe primate ventral stream of visual processing including Simple and Complex\ncells in V1, increasingly complicated feature encoding, and increased\nseparability of object representations in higher cortical areas. The model\nlearns representations of the visual environment that allow for accurate\nclassification and state-of-the-art visual tracking performance on novel\nobjects.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06277v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

Previous finding\nrevealed that these species are genetically distinct and easily recognized by\nthe number of flowers per inflorescence and pod dimensions. However,\nbiometrical traits and isozyme patterns intermediacy between these two species\nhad detected the existence of a potential spontaneous interspecific hybrid\noriginating from Sedjnane locality in Tunisia. Indeed, the present work has\nshown significant decrease of pollen fertility and seed production for this\npopulation when compared to the others(pollen viability 75%, pollen\ngerminability 8% and pod production=9%).

[u'Age-dependent Branching Processes and Applications to the\n  Luria-Delbr\xfcck Experiment', ['Stephen Montgomery-Smith', 'Hesam Oveys'], u'2016-08-22', u'Microbial populations adapt to their environment by acquiring advantageous\nmutations, but in the early twentieth century, questions about how these\norganisms acquire mutations arose. The experiment of Salvador Luria and Max\nDelbr\\"uck that won them a Nobel Prize in 1969 confirmed that mutations don\'t\noccur out of necessity, but instead can occur many generations before there is\na selective advantage, and thus organisms follow Darwinian evolution instead of\nLamarckian. Since then, new areas of research involving microbial evolution\nhave spawned as a result of their experiment. Determining the mutation rate of\na cell is one such area. Probability distributions that determine the number of\nmutants in a large population have been derived by D. E. Lea, C. A. Coulson,\nand J. B. S. Haldane. However, not much work has been done when time of cell\ndivision is dependent on the cell age, and even less so when cell division is\nasymmetric, which is the case in most microbial populations. Using probability\ngenerating function methods, we rigorously construct a probability distribution\nfor the cell population size given a life-span distribution for both mother and\ndaughter cells, and then determine its asymptotic growth rate. We use this to\nconstruct a probability distribution for the number of mutants in a large cell\npopulation, which can be used with likelihood methods to estimate the cell\nmutation rate.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06314v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

Danforth'], u'2016-08-16', u"Herbert Simon's classic rich-gets-richer model is one of the simplest\nempirically supported mechanisms capable of generating heavy-tail size\ndistributions for complex systems. Simon argued analytically that a population\nof flavored elements growing by either adding a novel element or randomly\nreplicating an existing one would afford a distribution of group sizes with a\npower-law tail. Here, we show that, in fact, Simon's model does not produce a\nsimple power law size distribution as the initial element has a dominant\nfirst-mover advantage, and will be overrepresented by a factor proportional to\nthe inverse of the innovation probability. The first group's size discrepancy\ncannot be explained away as a transient of the model, and may therefore be many\norders of magnitude greater than expected. We demonstrate how Simon's analysis\nwas correct but incomplete, and expand our alternate analysis to quantify the\nvariability of long term rankings for all groups. We find that the expected\ntime for a first replication is infinite, and show how an incipient group must\nbreak the mechanism to improve their odds of success. Our findings call for a\nreexamination of preceding work invoking Simon's model and provide a revised\nunderstanding going forward.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06313v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

The two spikes, or Miyake Events, have now been\nwidely identified in tree-rings that grew in the years 775 and 994 CE.\nFurthermore, all other plant material that grew in these years would also have\nincorporated the anomalously high concentrations of radiocarbon. Crucially,\nsome plant-based artefacts, such as papyrus documents, timber beams and linen\ngarments, can also be allocated to specific positions within long, currently\nunfixed, historical sequences. Thus, Miyake Events represent a new source of\ntie-points that could provide the means for anchoring early chronologies to the\nabsolute timescale.

[u'Approximation and inference methods for stochastic biochemical kinetics\n  - a tutorial review', ['David Schnoerr', 'Guido Sanguinetti', 'Ramon Grima'], u'2016-08-23', u'Stochastic fluctuations of molecule numbers are ubiquitous in biological\nsystems. Important examples include gene expression and enzymatic processes in\nliving cells. Such systems are typically modelled as chemical reaction networks\nwhose dynamics are governed by the Chemical Master Equation. Despite its simple\nstructure, no analytic solutions to the Chemical Master Equation are known for\nmost systems. Moreover, stochastic simulations are computationally expensive,\nmaking systematic analysis and statistical inference a challenging task.\nConsequently, significant effort has been spent in recent decades on the\ndevelopment of efficient approximation and inference methods. This article\ngives an introduction to basic modelling concepts as well as an overview of\nstate of the art methods. First, we motivate and introduce deterministic and\nstochastic models for chemical networks, and give an overview of simulation and\nexact solution methods. Next, we discuss several approximation methods,\nincluding the chemical Langevin equation, the system size expansion, moment\nclosure approximations, time-scale separation approximations and hybrid\nmethods. We discuss their various properties and review recent advances and\nremaining challenges for these methods. We present a comparison of several of\nthese methods by means of a numerical case study and highlight various of their\nrespective advantages and disadvantages. Finally, we discuss the problem of\ninference from experimental data in the Bayesian framework and review recent\nmethods developed the literature.

[u'Identifying stochastic oscillations in single cell live imaging time\n  series using Gaussian processes', ['Nick E. Phillips', 'Cerys Manning', 'Nancy Papalopulu', 'Magnus Rattray'], u'2016-08-23', u'Multiple biological processes are driven by oscillatory gene expression at\ndifferent time scales. Oscillatory dynamics are thought to be widespread due to\ntheir superior information encoding capabilities, and single cell live imaging\nof gene expression has lead to a surge of dynamic, possibly oscillatory, data\nfor different gene networks. However, the regulation of gene expression at the\nlevel of an individual cell involves reactions between finite numbers of\nmolecules, and this can result in inherent randomness in oscillatory dynamics.\nFurthermore, the process of transcription has been shown to be bursty, which\nblurs the boundaries between aperiodic fluctuations and noisy oscillators.\nThus, there is an acute need for an objective statistical method for\nclassifying whether an experimentally derived noisy time series is periodic.\nHere we present a new data analysis method that combines mechanistic stochastic\nmodelling with the powerful methods of Bayesian non-parametric regression. Our\nmethod can distinguish oscillatory expression from random fluctuations of\nnon-oscillatory gene expression in single cell data, despite peak-to-peak\nvariability in period and amplitude of single cell oscillations. We show that\nour method outperforms the Lomb-Scargle periodogram in successfully classifying\ncells as oscillatory or non-oscillatory in data simulated from a simple genetic\noscillator model. Analysis of bioluminescent live cell imaging shows a\nsignificantly greater number of oscillatory cells when luciferase is driven by\na Hes1 promoter (10/19), which has previously been reported to oscillate, than\nthe constitutive MMLV promoter (0/25). The method can be applied to data from\nany gene network to both quantify the proportion of oscillating cells within a\npopulation and to measure the period and quality of oscillations.
