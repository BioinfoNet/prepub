[u'PeBLes: Prediction of B-cell epitope using molecular layers', ['Naga Bhushana Rao . K', 'Ranjit Prasad Bahadur'], u'2016-11-29', u'Characterization of B-cell protein epitope and developing critical parameters for its identification is one of the long standing interests. Using Layers algorithm, we introduced the concept of anchor residues to identify epitope. We have shown that majority of the epitope is composed of anchor residues and have significant bias in epitope for these residues. We optimized the search space reduction for epitope identification. We used Layers to non-randomly sample the antigen surface reducing the molecular surface to an average of 75 residues while preserving 50% of the epitope in the sample surface. To facilitate the comparison of favorite methods of researchers we compared the popular techniques used to identify epitope with their sampling performance and evaluation. We proposed an optimum Sr of 16 {\\AA} to sample the antigen molecules to reduce the search space, in which epitope is identified using buried surface area method. We used the combinations of molecular surface sampling, anchor residue intensity in surface, secondary structure and sequence information to predict epitope at an accuracy of 89%.

[u'Tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopic detection of aptamers', ['Siyu He', 'Hongyuan Li', 'Zhe He', 'Dmitri V. Voronine'], u'2016-11-29', u'Single molecule detection, sequencing and conformational mapping of aptamers are important for improving medical and biosensing technologies and for better understanding of biological processes at the molecular level. We obtain vibrational signals of single aptamers immobilized on gold substrates using tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS). We compare topographic and optical signals and investigate the fluctuations of the position-dependent TERS spectra. TERS mapping provides information about the chemical composition and conformation of aptamers, and paves the way to future single-molecule label-free sequencing.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09544v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u"Graph's Topology and Free Energy of a Spin Model on the Graph", ['Jeong-Mo Choi', 'Amy I. Gilson', 'Eugene I. Shakhnovich'], u'2016-11-29', u"In this work we show that there is a direct relationship between a graph's topology and the free energy of a spin system on the graph. We develop a method of separating topological and enthalpic contributions to the free energy, and find that considering the topology is sufficient to qualitatively compare the free energies of different graph systems at high temperature, even when the energetics are not fully known. This method was applied to the metal lattice system with defects, and we found that it partially explains why point defects are more stable than high-dimensional defects. Given the energetics, we can even quantitatively compare free energies of different graph structures via a closed form of linear graph contributions. The closed form is applied to predict the sequence space free energy of lattice proteins, which is a key factor determining the designability of a protein structure.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09483v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Measuring and modeling the perception of natural and unconstrained gaze in humans and machines', ['Daniel Harari', 'Tao Gao', 'Nancy Kanwisher', 'Joshua Tenenbaum', 'Shimon Ullman'], u'2016-11-29', u'Humans are remarkably adept at interpreting the gaze direction of other individuals in their surroundings. This skill is at the core of the ability to engage in joint visual attention, which is essential for establishing social interactions. How accurate are humans in determining the gaze direction of others in lifelike scenes, when they can move their heads and eyes freely, and what are the sources of information for the underlying perceptual processes? These questions pose a challenge from both empirical and computational perspectives, due to the complexity of the visual input in real-life situations. Here we measure empirically human accuracy in perceiving the gaze direction of others in lifelike scenes, and study computationally the sources of information and representations underlying this cognitive capacity. We show that humans perform better in face-to-face conditions compared with recorded conditions, and that this advantage is not due to the availability of input dynamics. We further show that humans are still performing well when only the eyes-region is visible, rather than the whole face. We develop a computational model, which replicates the pattern of human performance, including the finding that the eyes-region contains on its own, the required information for estimating both head orientation and direction of gaze. Consistent with neurophysiological findings on task-specific face regions in the brain, the learned computational representations reproduce perceptual effects such as the Wollaston illusion, when trained to estimate direction of gaze, but not when trained to recognize objects or faces.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09819v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Hierarchical neural representation of dream contents revealed by brain decoding with deep neural network features', ['Tomoyasu Horikawa', 'Yukiyasu Kamitani'], u'2016-11-29', u'Dreaming is generally thought to be generated by spontaneous brain activity during sleep with patterns common to waking experience. This view is supported by a recent study demonstrating that dreamed objects can be predicted from brain activity during sleep using statistical decoders trained with stimulus-induced brain activity. However, it remains unclear whether and how visual image features associated with dreamed objects are represented in the brain. In this study, we used a deep neural network (DNN) model for object recognition as a proxy for hierarchical visual feature representation, and DNN features for dreamed objects were analyzed with brain decoding of fMRI data collected during dreaming. The decoders were first trained with stimulus-induced brain activity labeled with the feature values of the stimulus image from multiple DNN layers. The decoders were then used to decode DNN features from the dream fMRI data, and the decoded features were compared with the averaged features of each object category calculated from a large-scale image database. We found that the feature values decoded from the dream fMRI data positively correlated with those associated with dreamed object categories at mid- to high-level DNN layers. Using the decoded features, the dreamed object category could be correctly identified by matching them to the averaged features for multiple candidate categories. The results suggest that dreaming recruits hierarchical visual feature representations associated with objects, which may support phenomenal aspects of dream experience.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09520v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Spatial organization, grouping strategies and cyclic dominance in asymmetric predator-prey games', ['Annette Cazaubiel', 'Alessandra F. Lutz', 'Jeferson J. Arenzon'], u'2016-11-29', u'Predators may attack isolated or grouped preys in a cooperative, collective way. Whether a gregarious behavior is advantageous to each species depends on several conditions and game theory is a useful tool to deal with such a problem. We here extend the Lett-Auger-Gaillard model [Theor. Pop. Biol. {\\bf 65}, 263 (2004)] to spatially distributed groups and compare the resulting behavior with their mean field predictions for the coevolving densities of predator and prey strategies. We show that the coexistence phase in which both strategies for each group are present is stable because of an effective, cyclic dominance behavior similar to a well studied generalizations of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game with four species (without neutral pairs), a further example of how ubiquitous this mechanism is. In addition, inside the coexistence phase (but interestingly, only for finite size systems) there is a realization of the survival of the weakest effect that is triggered by a percolation crossover.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09624v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Stability of two-species communities: drift, environmental stochasticity, storage effect and selection', ['Matan Danino', 'David A. Kessler', 'Nadav M. Shnerb'], u'2016-11-29', u'The dynamics of two competing species in a finite size community is one of the most studied problems in population genetics and community ecology. Stochastic fluctuations lead, inevitably, to the extinction of one of the species, but the relevant timescale depends on the underlying dynamics. The persistence time of the community has been calculated for neutral models, where the only drive of the system is drift (demographic stochasticity) and for models with strong selection. Following recent analyses that stress the importance of environmental stochasticity in empirical systems, we present here a general theory of persistence time of two-species community where drift, environmental variations and time independent selective advantage are all taken into account.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09565v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Interspecific allometric scaling of unicellular organisms as an evolutionary process of food chain creation', ['Yuri K. Shestopaloff'], u'2016-11-29', u"Metabolism of living organisms is a foundation of life. The metabolic rate (energy production per unit time) increases slower than organisms' mass. When this phenomenon is considered across different species, it is called interspecific allometric scaling, whose causes are unknown. We argue that the cause of interspecific allometric scaling is the total effect of physiological and adaptation mechanisms inherent to organisms composing a food chain. Together, the workings of these mechanisms are united by a primary goal of any living creature - its successful reproduction. This primary necessity of each organism and of the entire food chain is that common denominator, to which all organisms adjust their metabolic rates. In this article, we consider unicellular organisms, while the second paper studies multicellular organisms and the entire concept in more detail. Here, using the proposed concepts and experimentally verified growth models of five different unicellular organisms, we obtain close to experimental findings values of allometric exponents of 0.757 for the end of growth and 0.853 for the beginning of growth. These results comply with experimental observations and prove our theory that the requirement of successful reproduction within the food chain is an important factor shaping interspecific allometric scaling.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09824v1', ['Other'], []]
[u'Exploring Strategies for Classification of External Stimuli Using Statistical Features of the Plant Electrical Response', ['Shre Kumar Chatterjee', 'Saptarshi Das', 'Koushik Maharatna', 'Elisa Masi', 'Luisa Santopolo', 'Stefano Mancuso', 'Andrea Vitaletti'], u'2016-11-29', u'Plants sense their environment by producing electrical signals which in essence represent changes in underlying physiological processes. These electrical signals, when monitored, show both stochastic and deterministic dynamics. In this paper, we compute 11 statistical features from the raw non-stationary plant electrical signal time series to classify the stimulus applied (causing the electrical signal). By using different discriminant analysis based classification techniques, we successfully establish that there is enough information in the raw electrical signal to classify the stimuli. In the process, we also propose two standard features which consistently give good classification results for three types of stimuli - Sodium Chloride (NaCl), Sulphuric Acid (H2SO4) and Ozone (O3). This may facilitate reduction in the complexity involved in computing all the features for online classification of similar external stimuli in future.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09820v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Time Dependent Saddle Node Bifurcation: Breaking Time and the Point of No Return in a Non-Autonomous Model of Critical Transitions', ['Jeremiah Li', 'Felix X. -F. Ye', 'Hong Qian', 'Sui Huang'], u'2016-11-29', u'We investigate a simple model of a non-autonomous system with a time dependent parameter $p(\\tau)$ and its corresponding "dynamic" (time-dependent) saddle-node bifurcation. We show that the actual point of no return for a system undergoing a critical transition can be significantly delayed in comparison to the breaking time $\\hat{\\tau}$ at which the corresponding autonomous system with a time-independent parameter $p_{a}= p(\\hat{\\tau})$ undergoes a bifurcation. A dimensionless parameter $\\alpha=\\lambda p_0^3V^{-2}$ is introduced, in which $\\lambda$ is the curvature of the autonomous saddle-node bifurcation according to parameter $p(\\tau)$, which has an initial value of $p_{0}$ and a constant rate of change $V$. We find that the breaking time $\\hat{\\tau}$ is always less than the actual point of no return $\\tau^*$ after which the critical transition is irreversible; specifically, the relation $\\tau^*-\\hat{\\tau}\\simeq 2.338(\\lambda V)^{-\\frac{1}{3}}$ is analytically obtained. For a system with a small $\\lambda V$, there exists a significant window of opportunity $(\\hat{\\tau},\\tau^*)$ during which rapid reversal of the environment can save the system from catastrophe. Application to the modeling of critical transitions and critical phenomena in the natural sciences is discussed.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09542v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]

Franc'], u'2016-11-28', u"Metabarcoding on amplicons is rapidly expanding as a method to produce molecular based inventories of microbial communities. Here, we work on freshwater diatoms, which are microalgae possibly inventoried both on a morphological and a molecular basis. We have developed an algorithm, in a program called diagno-syst, based a the notion of informative read, which carries out supervised clustering of reads by mapping them exactly one by one on all reads of a well curated and taxonomically annotated reference database. This program has been run on a HPC (and HTC) infrastructure to address computation load. We compare optical and molecular based inventories on 10 samples from L\\'eman lake, and 30 from Swedish rivers. We track all possibilities of mismatches between both approaches, and compare the results with standard pipelines (with heuristics) like Mothur. We find that the comparison with optics is more accurate when using exact calculations, at the price of a heavier computation load. It is crucial when studying the long tail of biodiversity, which may be overestimated by pipelines or algorithms using heuristics instead (more false positive). This work supports the analysis that these methods will benefit from progress in, first, building an agreement between molecular based and morphological based systematics and, second, having as complete as possible publicly available reference databases.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09410v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
