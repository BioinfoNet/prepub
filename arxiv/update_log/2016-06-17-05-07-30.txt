[u'Universal criterion for designability of heteropolymers', ['Chiara Cardelli', 'Valentino Bianco', 'Lorenzo Rovigatti', 'Francesca Nerattini', 'Luca Tubiana', 'Christoph Dellago', 'Ivan Coluzza'], u'2016-06-16', u'Proteins are an example of heteropolymers able to self-assemble in specific\ntarget structures. The self-assembly of designed artificial heteropolymers is\nstill, to the best of our knowledge, not possible with control over the single\nchain self-assembling properties comparable to what natural proteins can\nachieve. What artificial heteropolymers lacks compared to bio-heteropolymers\nthat grants the latter such a versatility? Is the geometry of the protein\nskeleton the only a particular choice to be designable? Here we introduce a\ngeneral criteria to discriminate which polymer backbones can be designed to\nadopt a predetermined structure. With our approach we can explore different\npolymer backbones and different amino acids alphabets. By comparing the radial\ndistribution functions of designable and not-designable scenarios we identify\nas designability criteria the presence of a particular peak in the radial\ndistribution function that dominates over the random packing of the\nheteropolymer. We show that the peak is a universal feature of all designable\nheteropolymers, as it is dominating also the radial distribution function of\nnatural proteins. Our finding can help in understanding the key features that\nmake proteins a highly designable system. The criteria that we present can be\napplied to engineer new types of self-assembling modular polymers that will\nopen new applications for polymer based material science.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05253v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Animated 3D Human Models for Use in Person Recognition Experiments', ['Jean M. Vettel', 'Justin Kantner', 'Matthew Jaswa', 'Michael Miller'], u'2016-06-15', u'The development of increasingly realistic experimental stimuli and task\nenvironments is important for understanding behavior outside the laboratory. We\nreport a process for generating 3D human model stimuli that combines commonly\nused graphics software and enables the flexible generation of animated human\nmodels while providing parametric control over individualized identity\nfeatures. Our approach creates novel head models using FaceGen Modeller,\nattaches them to commercially-purchased 3D avatar bodies in 3D Studio Max, and\ngenerates Cal3D human models that are compatible with many virtual 3D\nenvironments. Stimuli produced by this method can be embedded as animated 3D\navatars in interactive simulations or presented as 2D images embedded in scenes\nfor use in traditional laboratory experiments. The inherent flexibility in this\nmethod makes the stimuli applicable to a broad range of basic and applied\nresearch questions in the domain of person perception. We describe the steps of\nthe stimulus generation process, provide an example of their use in a\nrecognition memory paradigm, and highlight the adaptability of the method for\nrelated avenues of research.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05006v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Temporal and Semantic Effects on Multisensory Integration', ['Jean M. Vettel', 'Julia R. Green', 'Laurie Heller', 'Michael J. Tarr'], u'2016-06-15', u'How do we integrate modality-specific perceptual information arising from the\nsame physical event into a coherent percept? One possibility is that observers\nrely on information across perceptual modalities that shares temporal structure\nand/or semantic associations. To explore the contributions of these two factors\nin multisensory integration, we manipulated the temporal and semantic\nrelationships between auditory and visual information produced by real-world\nevents, such as paper tearing or cards being shuffled. We identified distinct\nneural substrates for integration based on temporal structure as compared to\nintegration based on event semantics. Semantically incongruent events recruited\nleft frontal regions, while temporally asynchronous events recruited right\nfrontal cortices. At the same time, both forms of incongruence recruited\nsubregions in the temporal, occipital, and lingual cortices. Finally, events\nthat were both temporally and semantically congruent modulated activity in the\nparahippocampus and anterior temporal lobe. Taken together, these results\nindicate that low-level perceptual properties such as temporal synchrony and\nhigh-level knowledge such as semantics play a role in our coherent perceptual\nexperience of physical events.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05004v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Haldane linearisation done right: Solving the nonlinear recombination\n  equation the easy way', ['Ellen Baake', 'Michael Baake'], u'2016-06-16', u'The nonlinear recombination equation from population genetics has a long\nhistory and is notoriously difficult to solve, both in continuous and in\ndiscrete time. This is particularly so if one aims at full generality, thus\nalso including degenerate parameter cases. Due to recent progress for the\ncontinuous time case via the identification of an underlying stochastic\nfragmentation process, it became clear that a direct general solution at the\nlevel of the corresponding ODE itself should also be possible. This paper shows\nhow to do it, and how to extend the approach to the discrete-time case as well.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05175v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], [u'Bielefeld']]
[u'Comparing Single Molecule Tracking and correlative approaches: an\n  application to the datasets recently presented in Nature Methods by Chenuard\n  et al', ['Carmine di Rienzo', 'Paolo Annibale'], u'2016-06-16', u'Recent efforts to survey the numerous softwares available to perform single\nmolecule tracking (SMT) highlighted a significant dependence of the outcomes on\nthe specific method used, and the limitation encountered by most techniques to\ncapture fast movements in a crowded environment. Other approaches to identify\nthe mode and rapidity of motion of fluorescently labeled biomolecules, that do\nnot relay on the localization and linking of the images of isolated single\nmolecules are, however, available.This direct comparison shows that correlative\nimaging analysis approaches complement effectively current SMT methods in\ncircumstances when, due to either the density of the sample, the low signal to\nnoise ratio or molecular blinking, trajectory linking does not allow to capture\nlong-range or fast motion.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05153v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]

This novel\napproach is a newbie and has critical advantages over the traditional Capillary\nElectrophoresis (CE) based Sanger Sequencing. The advancement of NGS has led to\nnumerous important discoveries, which could have been costlier and time taking\nin case of traditional CE based Sanger sequencing.
