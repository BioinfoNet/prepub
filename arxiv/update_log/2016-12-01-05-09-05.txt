[u'How to measure the topological quality of protein grammars?', ['Witold Dyrka', 'Francois Coste', 'Olgierd Unold', 'ukasz Culer', 'Agnieszka Kaczmarek'], u'2016-11-30', u'Context-free and context-sensitive formal grammars are often regarded as more appropriate to model proteins than regular level models such as finite state automata and Hidden Markov Models. In theory, the claim is well founded in the fact that many biologically relevant interactions between residues of protein sequences have a character of nested or crossed dependencies. In practice, there is hardly any evidence that grammars of higher expressiveness have an edge over old good HMMs in typical applications including recognition and classification of protein sequences. This is in contrast to RNA modeling, where CFG power some of the most successful tools. There have been proposed several explanations of this phenomenon. On the biology side, one difficulty is that interactions in proteins are often less specific and more "collective" in comparison to RNA. On the modeling side, a difficulty is the larger alphabet which combined with high complexity of CF and CS grammars imposes considerable trade-offs consisting on information reduction or learning sub-optimal solutions. Indeed, some studies hinted that CF level of expressiveness brought an added value in protein modeling when CF and regular grammars where implemented in the same framework. However, there have been no systematic study of explanatory power provided by various grammatical models. The first step to this goal is define objective criteria of such evaluation. Intuitively, a decent explanatory grammar should generate topology, or the parse tree, consistent with topology of the protein, or its secondary and/or tertiary structure. In this piece of research we build on this intuition and propose a set of measures to compare topology of the parse tree of a grammar with topology of the protein structure.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.10078v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Lipidomic approach for stratification of Acute Myeloid Leukemia patients', ['Christian Thiede', 'Gerhard Ehninger', 'Kai Simons', 'Michal Grzybek', 'Adam Stefanko'], u'2016-11-30', u'The pathogenesis and progression of many tumors, including hematologic malignancies is highly dependent on enhanced lipogenesis. De novo fatty-acid synthesis permits accelerated proliferation of tumor cells by providing structural components to build the membranes. It may also lead to alterations of physicochemical properties of the formed membranes, which can have an impact on signaling or even increase resistance to drugs in cancer cells. Cancer type-specific lipid profiles would allow understanding the actual effects of lipid changes and therefore could potentially serve as fingerprints for individual tumors and be explored as diagnostic markers. We have used shotgun MS approach to identify lipid patterns in different types of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients that either show no karyotype changes or belong to t(8;21) or inv16 types. The observed differences in lipidomes of t(8;21) and inv(16) patients, as compared to AML patients without karyotype changes, concentrate mostly on substantial modulation of ceramides/sphingolipids synthesis. Also significant changes in the physicochemical properties of the membranes, between the t(8;21) and the other patients, were noted that were related to a marked alteration in the saturation levels of lipids. The revealed differences in lipid profiles of various AML types increase our understanding of the affected biochemical pathways and can potentially serve as diagnostic tools.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.10042v1', ['Biomolecules', 'Quantitative Methods', 'Molecular Networks', 'Genomics'], []]
[u'A framework to reconcile frequency scaling measurements, from intracellular recordings, local-field potentials, up to EEG and MEG signals', ['Claude Bedard', 'Jean-Marie Gomes', 'Thierry Bal', 'Alain Destexhe'], u'2016-11-30', u'In this viewpoint article, we discuss the electric properties of the medium around neurons, which are important to correctly interpret extracellular potentials or electric field effects in neural tissue. We focus on how these electric properties shape the frequency scaling of brain signals at different scales, such as intracellular recordings, the local field potential (LFP), the electroencephalogram (EEG) or the magnetoencephalogram (MEG). These signals display frequency-scaling properties which are not consistent with resistive media. The medium appears to exert a frequency filtering scaling as $1/\\sqrt{f}$, which is the typical frequency scaling of ionic diffusion. Such a scaling was also found recently by impedance measurements in physiological conditions. Ionic diffusion appears to be the only possible explanation to reconcile these measurements and the frequency-scaling properties found in different brain signals. However, other measurements suggest that the extracellular medium is essentially resistive. To resolve this discrepancy, we show new evidence that metal-electrode measurements can be perturbed by shunt currents going through the surface of the brain. Such a shunt may explain the contradictory measurements, and together with ionic diffusion, provides a framework where all observations can be reconciled. Finally, we propose a method to perform measurements avoiding shunting effects, thus enabling to test the predictions of this framework.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.10047v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Vocabulary and the Brain: Evidence from Neuroimaging Studies', ['Tom A. F. Anderson', 'C. -H. Ruan'], u'2016-11-30', u'In summary of the research findings presented in this paper, various brain regions are correlated with vocabulary and vocabulary acquisition. Semantic associations for vocabulary seem to be located near brain areas that vary according to the type of vocabulary, e.g. ventral temporal regions important for words for things that can be seen. Semantic processing is believed to be strongly associated with the ANG. Phonological ability has been closely related to the anterior surfaces of the SMG. Pathways through the posterior SMG are thought to link the anterior SMG and the ANG. In vocabulary tasks, mediotemporal structures may be related to long-term memory processing, with left hippocampal and parahippocampal regions related to long-term and working memory, respectively. Precentral structures are associated with phonological retrieval. Furthermore, many more regions of the brain are of interest in vocabulary tasks, particularly in areas important for visual and auditory processing. Furthermore, differences between brain anatomies can be attributed to vocabulary demands of different languages.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.10003v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'SeDMiD for Confusion Detection: Uncovering Mind State from Time Series Brain Wave Data', ['Jingkang Yang', 'Haohan Wang', 'Jun Zhu', 'Eric P. Xing'], u'2016-11-29', u'Understanding how brain functions has been an intriguing topic for years. With the recent progress on collecting massive data and developing advanced technology, people have become interested in addressing the challenge of decoding brain wave data into meaningful mind states, with many machine learning models and algorithms being revisited and developed, especially the ones that handle time series data because of the nature of brain waves. However, many of these time series models, like HMM with hidden state in discrete space or State Space Model with hidden state in continuous space, only work with one source of data and cannot handle different sources of information simultaneously. In this paper, we propose an extension of State Space Model to work with different sources of information together with its learning and inference algorithms. We apply this model to decode the mind state of students during lectures based on their brain waves and reach a significant better results compared to traditional methods.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.10252v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Predicting the Category and Attributes of Mental Pictures Using Deep Gaze Pooling', ['Hosnieh Sattar', 'Andreas Bulling', 'Mario Fritz'], u'2016-11-27', u"Previous work focused on predicting visual search targets from human fixations but, in the real world, a specific target is often not known, e.g. when searching for a present for a friend. In this work we instead study the problem of predicting the mental picture, i.e. only an abstract idea instead of a specific target. This task is significantly more challenging given that mental pictures of the same target category can vary widely depending on personal biases, and given that characteristic target attributes can often not be verbalised explicitly. We instead propose to use gaze information as implicit information on users' mental picture and present a novel gaze pooling layer to seamlessly integrate semantic and localized fixation information into a deep image representation. We show that we can robustly predict both the mental picture's category as well as attributes on a novel dataset containing fixation data of 14 users searching for targets on a subset of the DeepFahion dataset. Our results have important implications for future search interfaces and suggest deep gaze pooling as a general-purpose approach for gaze-supported computer vision systems.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.10162v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'More than trees, do we need a complex perspective for sustainable forest management?', ['Oliver Lopez-Corona', 'Elvia Ramirez-Carrillo', 'Vanessa Perez-Cirera', 'Fernando de Leon-Gonzalez', 'Rodolfo Dirzo'], u'2016-11-30', u'Forests are complex systems, and it is necessary to include this characteristic in every forest definition, in order to consider the restriction that this imposes in terms of prediction and control. This lost of predictability and controllability should be incorporated in every Environmental Impact Assessment or management program. We present two case-studies located in Mexico and one in the US to illustrate three relevant indicators of complexity. First, we introduce an informational framework to measure the Zoquiapan forest systemic complexity. Then, we analyze complexity changes among different types of forest and management systems, related with spatial distributions, using data from a floristic study in the Montes Azules National Park. Finally, we analyze time series of $CO_{2}$ fluctuations taken from AMERIFLUX data bases. Our results show firstly that it is possible to measure the systemic complexity of different forests, characteized by a criticality state (1/f noise) which has been proposed as a finger print of complexity. And secondly, that this characteristic can be used as a proxy of their state of conservation, where the lowest complexity values are found in perturbed areas showing the relevance of the concept and its measurement for forest conservation and management.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.10339v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Research into the Potential to Adapt and Establish of the invasive Asian Tiger Mosquito Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus (SKUSE)', ['Aljoscha Kress'], u'2016-11-30', u'There is general agreement that the former (breeding) macrohabitat of the Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus (synonym: Stegomyia albopicta) has been described as phytotelmata in the forested areas of Southeast Asia, however, this has changed in the last four decades as it has adapted to more urban areas and antrotelmata. Capable of producing eggs with a certain dry resistance as well as cold hardiness, populations of Ae. albopictus became distributed around the globe. The invasion of the Ae. albopictus across all over the world is thought to be the most rapid spread of any insect species in the last four decades in tropical, subtropical and temperate climate zones. In addition, Ae. albopictus is a potential vector for at least 27 viruses as well as for several parasites and plays a major role in the global transmission of dengue virus and chikungunya virus; and its contribution to the rapid spread of zika virus is currently under investigation. Therefore, this species is considered a serious threat to public health worldwide. This work broaches the issue of three investigations about the potential to adapt and establish stabile populations of the invasive Asian tiger mosquito Ae. albopictus. As a result of these investigations, a high potential for this species to become a threat to public health in many more countries, especially in temperate climatic zones, can be seen. Due to the fact on the one hand that Ae. albopictus can gain fitness advantages due to misapplied vector control measures and on the other hand of the high epigenetically adaptation potential, it is in summary recommended to focus further research on the development of vaccinations for viruses and other pathogens. By doing so, citizens will be protected without putting ecosystems and their services in danger and it is the even more economic solution.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.10318v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'A rare mutation model in a spatial heterogeneous environment: the Hawk and Dove game', ['Anna Lisa Amadori', 'Roberto Natalini', 'Davide Palmigiani'], u'2016-11-30', u'We propose a stochastic model in evolutionary game theory where individuals (or subpopulations) can mutate changing their strategies randomly (but rarely) and explore the external environment. This environment affects the selective pressure by modifying the payoff arising from the interactions between strategies. We derive a Fokker-Plank integro-differential equation and provide Monte-Carlo simulations for the Hawks vs Doves game. In particular we show that, in some cases, taking into account the external environment favors the persistence of the low-fitness strategy.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.10236v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

[u'The optimal rate for resolving a near-polytomy in a phylogeny', ['Mike Steel', 'Christoph Leuenberger'], u'2016-11-30', u'The reconstruction of phylogenetic trees from discrete character data is typically relies on models that assume the characters evolve under a continuous-time Markov process operating at some overall rate $\\lambda$. When $\\lambda$ is too high or too low, it becomes difficult to distinguish between a short interior edge from a polytomy (the tree that results from collapsing the edge). In this short note we investigate the rate that maximizes the expected log-likelihood ratio (i.e. Kullback-Leibler separation) between the four-leaf unresolved (star) tree and a four-leaf binary tree with interior edge length $\\epsilon$. For a simple 2-state model we show that as $\\epsilon$ converges to $0$ the optimal rate also converges to zero when the four pendant edges have equal length. However, when the four pendant branches have unequal length, two local optima can arise, and it is possible for the the globally optimal rate to converge to a non-zero constant as $\\epsilon \\rightarrow 0$. Moreover, in the setting where the four pendant branches have equal length and either (i) we replace the 2-state model by an infinite state model or (ii) we retain the 2-state model and replace Kullback-Leibler separation by Euclidean distance as the maximization goal then the optimal rate also converges to a non-zero constant.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09950v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Statistical physics approaches to subnetwork dynamics in biochemical systems', ['Barbara Bravi', 'Peter Sollich'], u'2016-11-28', u'We apply a Gaussian variational approximation to model reduction in large biochemical networks of unary and binary reactions. We focus on a small subset of variables (subnetwork) of interest, e.g. because they are accessible experimentally, embedded in a larger network (bulk). The key goal is to write dynamical equations reduced to the subnetwork but still retaining the effects of the bulk. As a result, the subnetwork-reduced dynamics contains a memory term and an extrinsic noise term with non-trivial temporal correlations. We first derive expressions for this memory and noise in the linearized (Gaussian) dynamics and then use a perturbative power expansion to obtain first order nonlinear corrections. For the case of vanishing intrinsic noise, our description is explicitly shown to be equivalent to projection methods up to quadratic terms, but it is applicable also in the presence of stochastic fluctuations in the original dynamics. An example from the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) signalling pathway is provided to probe the increased prediction accuracy and computational efficiency of our method.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09849v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
