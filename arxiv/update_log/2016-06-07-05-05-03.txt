[u'J-factors of short DNA molecules', ['Marco Zoli'], u'2016-06-04', u'The propensity of short DNA sequences to convert to the circular form is\nstudied by a mesoscopic Hamiltonian method which incorporates both the bending\nof the molecule axis and the intrinsic twist of the DNA strands. The base pair\nfluctuations with respect to the helix diameter are treated as path\ntrajectories in the imaginary time path integral formalism. The partition\nfunction for the sub-ensemble of closed molecules is computed by imposing chain\nends boundary conditions both on the radial fluctuations and on the angular\ndegrees of freedom. The cyclization probability, the J-factor, proves to be\nhighly sensitive to the stacking potential, mostly to its nonlinear parameters.\nWe find that the J-factor generally decreases by reducing the sequence length (\nN ) and, more significantly, below N = 100 base pairs. However, even for very\nsmall molecules, the J-factors remain sizeable in line with recent experimental\nindications. Large bending angles between adjacent base pairs and anharmonic\nstacking appear as the causes of the helix flexibility at short length scales.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01357v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]

By using a biophysical\nmodel that incorporates autaptic coupling, we here show that self-innervation\nof neurons participates in the modulation of irregular neuronal firing,\nprimarily by regulating the occurrence frequency of burst firing. In\nparticular, we find that both excitatory and electrical autapses increase the\noccurrence of burst firing, thus reducing neuronal firing regularity. In\ncontrast, inhibitory autapses suppress burst firing and therefore tend to\nimprove the regularity of neuronal firing. Importantly, we show that these\nfindings are independent of the firing properties of individual neurons, and as\nsuch can be observed for neurons operating in different modes. Our results\nprovide an insightful mechanistic understanding of how different types of\nautapses shape irregular firing at the single-neuron level, and they highlight\nthe functional importance of autaptic self-innervation in taming and modulating\nneurodynamics.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01684v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

We find conditions under which a simple\nfeedforward computation is a very good initialization for inference, after the\ninput units are clamped to observed values. It means that after the feedforward\ninitialization, the recurrent network is very close to a fixed point of the\nnetwork dynamics, where the energy gradient is 0. The main condition is that\nconsecutive layers form a good auto-encoder, or more generally that different\ngroups of inputs into the unit (in particular, bottom-up inputs on one hand,\ntop-down inputs on the other hand) are consistent with each other, producing\nthe same contribution into the total weighted sum of inputs. In biological\nterms, this would correspond to having each dendritic branch correctly\npredicting the aggregate input from all the dendritic branches, i.e., the soma\npotential. This is consistent with the prediction that the synaptic weights\ninto dendritic branches such as those of the apical and basal dendrites of\npyramidal cells are trained to minimize the prediction error made by the\ndendritic branch when the target is the somatic activity. Whereas previous work\nhas shown how to achieve fast negative phase inference (when the model is\nunclamped) in a predictive recurrent model, this contribution helps to achieve\nfast positive phase inference (when the target output is clamped) in such\nrecurrent neural models.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01651v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

Critical to the assessment of outbreak risk, estimation of the\npotential attack rates, and assessment of control measures, are estimates of\nthe basic reproduction number, R0, and estimates of the relative role of sexual\ntransmission in outbreak dynamics.\n  Methods: We estimate R0, and relative role of sexual transmission, of the\n2015 ZIKV outbreak in Barranquilla, Colombia, through an analysis of the\nexponential rise in identified syndromic ZIKV cases (n=1,470 to the end of\nDecember, 2015).\n  Findings: The rate of exponential rise in cases was rho=0.073 days-1, with\n95% CI [0.064,0.082] days-1. Using a vector borne disease model, we estimate\nR0=4.4 with 95% CI [3.0,6.2]. Using a novel vector borne disease model with\nadditional direct sexual transmission, we find that sexual transmission is not\nlikely significant enough to achieve sustained transmission in the absence of\nmosquitoes. The percentage of cases due to sexual transmission is less than 30%\n(95% CL).\n  Interpretation: This is among the first estimates of R0 for a ZIKV outbreak\nin the Americas, and the first quantification of the relative role of sexual\ntransmission. While potentially responsible for a significant fraction of\ncases, we find sustained sexual transmission alone is unlikely.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01422v1', ['Populations and Evolution', 'Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Evolutionary consequences of behavioral diversity', ['Alexander J. Stewart', 'Todd L. Parsons', 'Joshua B.

Recent work stimulated by the discovery of\n"zero-determinant" strategies has rapidly expanded our ability to analyze such\ninteractions. This body of work has primarily focused on games in which players\nface a simple binary choice, to "cooperate" or "defect". Real individuals,\nhowever, often exhibit behavioral diversity, varying their input to a social\ninteraction both qualitatively and quantitatively. Here we explore how access\nto a greater diversity of behavioral choices impacts the evolution of social\ndynamics in finite populations. We show that, in public goods games, some\ntwo-choice strategies can nonetheless resist invasion by all possible\nmulti-choice invaders, even while engaging in relatively little punishment. We\nalso show that access to greater behavioral choice results in more "rugged "\nfitness landscapes, with populations able to stabilize cooperation at multiple\nlevels of investment, such that choice facilitates cooperation when returns on\ninvestments are low, but hinders cooperation when returns on investments are\nhigh. Finally, we analyze iterated rock-paper-scissors games, whose\nnon-transitive payoff structure means unilateral control is difficult and\nzero-determinant strategies do not exist in general. Despite this, we find that\na large portion of multi-choice strategies can invade and resist invasion by\nstrategies that lack behavioral diversity -- so that even well-mixed\npopulations will tend to evolve behavioral diversity.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01401v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Probabilistic Model to Treat Flexibility in Molecular Contacts', ['Riku Hakulinen', 'Santeri Puranen'], u'2016-06-06', u"Evaluating accessible conformational space is computationally expensive and\nthermal motions are partly neglected in computer models of molecular\ninteractions. This produces error into the estimates of binding strength. We\nintroduce a method for modelling interactions so that structural flexibility is\ninherently taken into account. It has a statistical model for 3D properties of\n'nonlocal' contacts and a physics based description of 'local' interactions,\nbased on mechanical torque. The form of the torque barrier is derived using a\nrepresentation of the local electronic structure, which is presumed to improve\ntransferability, compared to traditional force fields. The nonlocal contacts\nare more distant than 1-4 interactions and Target-atoms are represented by 3D\nprobability densities. Probability mass quantifies strength of contact and is\ncalculated as an overlap integral. Repulsion is described by negative\nprobability density, allowing probability mass to be used as the descriptor of\ncontact preference. As a result, we are able to transform the high-dimensional\nproblem into a simpler evaluation of three-dimensional integrals. We outline\nhow this scoring function gives a tool to study the enthalpy--entropy\ncompensation and demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by evaluating\nnumerical probability masses for chosen side chain to main chain contacts in a\nlysine dipeptide structure.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01696v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]

In this paper, we simulate blood flow and oxygen\ntransfer in feto-placental capillaries by converting three-dimensional\nrepresentations of villous and capillary surfaces, reconstructed from confocal\nlaser scanning microscopy, to finite-element meshes, and calculating values of\nvascular flow resistance and total oxygen transfer. The relationship between\nthe total oxygen transfer rate and the pressure drop through the capillary is\nshown to be captured across a wide range of pressure drops by physical scaling\nlaws and an upper bound on the oxygen transfer rate. A regression equation is\nintroduced that can be used to estimate the oxygen transfer in a capillary\nusing only the vascular resistance and the total capillary length. Two\ntechniques for quantifying the effects of statistical variability, experimental\nuncertainty and pathological placental structure on the calculated properties\nare then introduced. First, scaling arguments are used to quantify the\nsensitivity of the model to uncertainties in the geometry and the parameters.\nSecond, the effects of localized dilations in fetal capillaries are\ninvestigated using an idealized axisymmetric model, to quantify the possible\neffect of pathological placental structure on oxygen transfer. The model\npredicts how, for a fixed pressure drop through a capillary, oxygen transfer is\nmaximized by an optimal width of the dilation. The results could explain the\nprevalence of fetal hypoxia in cases of delayed villous maturation, a pathology\ncharacterized by a lack of the vasculo-syncytial membranes often seen in\nconjunction with localized capillary dilations.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01802v1', ['Tissues and Organs'], []]
