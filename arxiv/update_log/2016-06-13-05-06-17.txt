[u'The impact of surface area, volume, curvature and Lennard-Jones\n  potential to solvation modeling', ['Duc Duy Nguyen', 'Guo-Wei Wei'], u'2016-06-10', u'This paper explores the impact of surface area, volume, curvature and\nLennard-Jones potential on solvation free energy predictions. Rigidity surfaces\nare utilized to generate robust analytical expressions for maximum, minimum,\nmean and Gaussian curvatures of solvent-solute interfaces, and define a\ngeneralized Poisson-Boltzmann (GPB) equation with a smooth dielectric profile.\nExtensive correlation analysis is performed to examine the linear dependence of\nsurface area, surface enclosed volume, maximum curvature, minimum curvature,\nmean curvature and Gaussian curvature for solvation modeling. It is found that\nsurface area and surfaces enclosed volumes are highly correlated to each\nothers, and poorly correlated to various curvatures for six test sets of\nmolecules. Different curvatures are weakly correlated to each other for six\ntest sets of molecules, but are strongly correlated to each other within each\ntest set of molecules. Based on correlation analysis, we construct twenty six\nnontrivial nonpolar solvation models. Our numerical results reveal that the\nLennard-Jones (LJ) potential plays a vital role in nonpolar solvation modeling,\nespecially for molecules involving strong van der Waals interactions. It is\nfound that curvatures are at least as important as surface area or surface\nenclosed volume in nonpolar solvation modeling. In conjugation with the GPB\nmodel, various curvature based nonpolar solvation models are shown to offer\nsome of the best solvation free energy predictions for a wide range of test\nsets. For example, root mean square errors from a model constituting surface\narea, volume, mean curvature and LJ potential are less than 0.42 kcal/mol for\nall test sets.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03422v1', ['Biomolecules', 'Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Formal Modeling and Analysis of Pancreatic Cancer Microenvironment', ['Qinsi Wang', 'Natasa Miskov-Zivanov', 'Bing Liu', 'James R. Faeder', 'Michael Lotze', 'Edmund M. Clarke'], u'2016-06-09', u'The focus of pancreatic cancer research has been shifted from pancreatic\ncancer cells towards their microenvironment, involving pancreatic stellate\ncells that interact with cancer cells and influence tumor progression. To\nquantitatively understand the pancreatic cancer microenvironment, we construct\na computational model for intracellular signaling networks of cancer cells and\nstellate cells as well as their intercellular communication. We extend the\nrule-based BioNetGen language to depict intra- and inter-cellular dynamics\nusing discrete and continuous variables respectively. Our framework also\nenables a statistical model checking procedure for analyzing the system\nbehavior in response to various perturbations. The results demonstrate the\npredictive power of our model by identifying important system properties that\nare consistent with existing experimental observations. We also obtain\ninteresting insights into the development of novel therapeutic strategies for\npancreatic cancer.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03138v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Intrinsic noise and deviations from criticality in Boolean\n  gene-regulatory networks', ['Pablo Villegas', 'Jose Ruiz-Franco', 'Jorge Hidalgo', 'Miguel A. Munoz'], u'2016-06-10', u'Gene regulatory networks can be successfully modeled as Boolean networks. A\nmuch discussed hypothesis says that such model networks reproduce empirical\nfindings the best if they are tuned to operate at criticality, i.e. at the\nborderline between their ordered and disordered phases. Critical networks have\nbeen argued to lead to a number of functional advantages such as maximal\ndynamical range, maximal sensitivity to environmental changes, as well as to an\nexcellent trade off between stability and flexibility. Here, we study the\neffect of noise within the context of Boolean networks trained to learn complex\ntasks under supervision. We verify that quasi-critical networks are the ones\nlearning in the fastest possible way --even for asynchronous updating rules--\nand that the larger the task complexity the smaller the distance to\ncriticality. On the other hand, when additional sources of intrinsic noise in\nthe network states and/or in its wiring pattern are introduced, the optimally\nperforming networks become clearly subcritical. These results suggest that in\norder to compensate for inherent stochasticity, regulatory and other type of\nbiological networks might become subcritical rather than being critical, all\nthe most if the task to be performed has limited complexity.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03235v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
[u'Clustering and Classification of Genetic Data Through U-Statistics', ['Gabriela Bettella Cybis', 'Marcio Valk', 'Silvia Regina Costa Lopes'], u'2016-06-10', u"Genetic data are frequently categorical and have complex dependence\nstructures that are not always well understood. For this reason, clustering and\nclassification based on genetic data, while highly relevant, are challenging\nstatistical problems. Here we consider a highly versatile U-statistics based\napproach built on dissimilarities between pairs of data points for\nnonparametric clustering. In this work we propose statistical tests to assess\ngroup homogeneity taking into account the multiple testing issues, and a\nclustering algorithm based on dissimilarities within and between groups that\nhighly speeds up the homogeneity test. We also propose a test to verify\nclassification significance of a sample in one of two groups. A Monte Carlo\nsimulation study is presented to evaluate power of the classification test,\nconsidering different group sizes and degree of separation. Size and power of\nthe homogeneity test are also analyzed through simulations that compare it to\ncompeting methods. Finally, the methodology is applied to three different\ngenetic datasets: global human genetic diversity, breast tumor gene expression\nand Dengue virus serotypes. These applications showcase this statistical\nframework's ability to answer diverse biological questions while adapting to\nthe specificities of the different datatypes.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03376v1', ['Genomics'], []]
