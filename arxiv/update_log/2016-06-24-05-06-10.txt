[u'Stochastic models of the binding kinetics of VEGF-A to VEGFR1 and VEGFR2\n  in endothelial cells', ['Martin Lopez-Garcia', 'Maria Nowicka', 'Claus Bendtsen', 'Grant Lythe', 'Sreenivasan Ponnambalam', 'Carmen Molina-Paris'], u'2016-06-23', u'Vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs) are receptor tyrosine\nkinases (RTKs) that regulate proliferation, migration, angiogenesis and\nvascular permeability of endothelial cells. VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 bind vascular\nendothelial growth factors (VEGFs), inducing receptor dimerisation and\nactivation, characterised by phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in their\ncytoplasmic domain. Although experimental evidence suggests that RTK signalling\noccurs both on the plasma membrane and intra-cellularly, and reveals the role\nof endocytosis in RTK signal transduction, we still lack knowledge of VEGFR\nphosphorylation-site use and of the spatiotemporal regulation of VEGFR\nsignalling. In this paper, we introduce four stochastic mathematical models to\nstudy the binding kinetics of vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF-A to\nVEGFR1 and VEGFR2, and phosphorylation. The formation of phosphorylated dimers\non the cell surface is a two-step process: diffusive transport and binding. The\nfirst two of our models only consider VEGFR2, which allows us to introduce new\nstochastic descriptors making use of a matrix-analytic approach. The two\nremaining models describe the competition of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 for ligand\navailability, and are analysed making use of Gillespie simulations and the van\nKampen approximation. Under the hypothesis that bound phosphorylated receptor\ndimers are the signalling units, we study the time to reach a threshold number\nof such complexes. Our results indicate that the presence of VEGFR1 does not\nonly affect the timescale to reach a given signalling threshold, but it also\naffects the maximum attainable threshold. This result is consistent with the\nconjectured role of VEGFR1 as a decoy receptor, that prevents VEGF-A binding to\nVEGFR2, and thus, VEGFR2 attaining suitable phosphorylation levels. We identify\nan optimum range of ligand concentration for sustained dimer phosphorylation.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07269v1', ['Biomolecules', 'Subcellular Processes'], []]
[u'Packaging stiff polymers in small containers: A molecular dynamics study', ['D. C. Rapaport'], u'2016-06-23', u'The question of how stiff polymers are able to pack into small containers is\nparticularly relevant to the study of DNA packaging in viruses. A reduced\nversion of the problem based on coarse-grained representations of the main\ncomponents of the system -- the DNA polymer and the spherical viral capsid --\nhas been studied by molecular dynamics simulation. The results, involving\nlonger polymers than in earlier work, show that as polymers become more rigid\nthere is an increasing tendency to self-organize as spools that wrap from the\ninside out, rather than the inverse direction seen previously. In the final\nstate, a substantial part of the polymer is packed into one or more coaxial\nspools, concentrically layered with different orientations, a form of packaging\nachievable without twisting the polymer.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07221v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Saddle-node loop bifurcations ubiquitously occur in conductance-based\n  model neurons and promote spike-based coding and synchronization', ['Janina Hesse', 'Jan-Hendrik Schleimer', 'Susanne Schreiber'], u'2016-06-23', u'Information processing in the brain crucially depends on coding properties of\nsingle neurons shaped by their intrinsic dynamics. Our theoretical study shows\nthat neuronal excitability, spike-based coding, and synchronization change\ndrastically around a special dynamical regime: the codimension-two saddle-node\nloop bifurcation. This bifurcation maximizes the entrainment range and turns\nout to be more relevant for spike-based processing than the typically\nconsidered Bogdanov-Takens point. We show that the saddle-node loop bifurcation\noccurs ubiquitously in a generic class of neuron models (planar type-I). Our\ntheory, applied to optical stimulation techniques, reveals that they could\nmanipulate a variety of information processing characteristics in nerve cells\nbeyond pure stimulation.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07398v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]

[u'In the Light of Deep Coalescence: Revisiting Trees Within Networks', ['Jiafan Zhu', 'Yun Yu', 'Luay Nakhleh'], u'2016-06-23', u"Phylogenetic networks model reticulate evolutionary histories. The last two\ndecades have seen an increased interest in establishing mathematical results\nand developing computational methods for inferring and analyzing these\nnetworks. A salient concept underlying a great majority of these developments\nhas been the notion that a network displays a set of trees and those trees can\nbe used to infer, analyze, and study the network.\n  In this paper, we show that in the presence of coalescence effects, the set\nof displayed trees is not sufficient to capture the network. We formally define\nthe set of parental trees of a network and make three contributions based on\nthis definition. First, we extend the notion of anomaly zone to phylogenetic\nnetworks and report on anomaly results for different networks. Second, we\ndemonstrate how coalescence events could negatively affect the ability to infer\na species tree that could be augmented into the correct network. Third, we\ndemonstrate how a phylogenetic network can be viewed as a mixture model that\nlends itself to a novel inference approach via gene tree clustering.\n  Our results demonstrate the limitations of focusing on the set of trees\ndisplayed by a network when analyzing and inferring the network. Our findings\ncan form the basis for achieving higher accuracy when inferring phylogenetic\nnetworks and open up new venues for research in this area, including new\nproblem formulations based on the notion of a network's parental trees.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07350v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Distinguishing Convergence on Phylogenetic Networks', ['Jonathan Mitchell'], u'2016-06-23', u'We compare the phylogenetic tensors for various trees and networks for two,\nthree and four taxa. If the probability spaces between one tree or network and\nanother are not identical then there will be phylogenetic tensors that could\nhave arisen on one but not the other. We call these two trees or networks\ndistinguishable from each other. We show that for the binary symmetric model\nthere are no two-taxon trees and networks that are distinguishable from each\nother, however there are three-taxon trees and networks that are\ndistinguishable from each other.\n  We compare the time parameters for the phylogenetic tensors for various taxon\nlabel permutations on a given tree or network. If the time parameters on one\ntaxon label permutation in terms of the other taxon label permutation are all\nnon-negative then we say that the two taxon label permutations are not network\nidentifiable from each other. We show that some taxon label permutations are\nnetwork identifiable from each other.\n  We show that some four-taxon networks satisfy the four-point condition. Of\nthe two "shapes" of four-taxon rooted trees, one is defined by the cluster,\nb,c,d, labelling taxa alphabetically from left to right. The network with this\nshape and convergence between the two taxa with the root as their most recent\ncommon ancestor satisfies the four-point condition.\n  The phylogenetic tensors contain polynomial equations that cannot be easily\nsolved for four-taxon or higher trees or networks. We show how methods from\nalgebraic geometry, such as Gr\\"obner bases, can be used to solve the\npolynomial equations. We show that some four-taxon trees and networks can be\ndistinguished from each other.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07160v1', ['Populations and Evolution', 'Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'The "Hard Problem" of Life', ['Sara Imari Walker', 'Paul C. W. Davies'], u'2016-06-23', u'Chalmer\'s famously identified pinpointing an explanation for our subjective\nexperience as the "hard problem of consciousness".

Here, we propose a\ncorresponding "hard problem of life" as the problem of how `information\' can\naffect the world. In this essay we motivate both why the problem of information\nas a causal agent is central to explaining life, and why it is hard - that is,\nwhy we suspect that a full resolution of the hard problem of life will, similar\nto as has been proposed for the hard problem of consciousness, ultimately not\nbe reducible to known physical principles.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07184v1', ['Other'], []]
[u'Transient cerebral hypoperfusion and hypertensive events during atrial\n  fibrillation: a plausible mechanism for cognitive impairment', ['Matteo Anselmino', 'Stefania Scarsoglio', 'Andrea Saglietto', 'Fiorenzo Gaita', 'Luca Ridolfi'], u'2016-06-23', u'Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with an increased risk of dementia and\ncognitive decline, independent of strokes. Several mechanisms have been\nproposed to explain this association, but altered cerebral blood flow dynamics\nduring AF has been poorly investigated: in particular, it is unknown how AF\ninfluences hemodynamic parameters of the distal cerebral circulation, at the\narteriolar and capillary level. Two coupled lumped-parameter models (systemic\nand cerebrovascular circulations, respectively) were here used to simulate\nsinus rhythm (SR) and AF. For each simulation 5000 cardiac cycles were analyzed\nand cerebral hemodynamic parameters were calculated. With respect to SR, AF\ntriggered a higher variability of the cerebral hemodynamic variables which\nincreases proceeding towards the distal circulation, reaching the maximum\nextent at the arteriolar and capillary levels. This variability led to critical\ncerebral hemodynamic events of excessive pressure or reduced blood flow: 303\nhypoperfusions occurred at the arteriolar level, while 387 hypertensive events\noccurred at the capillary level during AF. By contrast, neither hypoperfusions\nnor hypertensive events occurred during SR. Thus, the impact of AF per se on\ncerebral hemodynamics candidates as a relevant mechanism into the genesis of\nAF-related cognitive impairment/dementia.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07368v1', ['Tissues and Organs'], []]
