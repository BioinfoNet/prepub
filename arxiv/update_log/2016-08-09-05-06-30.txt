[u'Towards the Self-constructive Brain: emergence of adaptive behavior', ['Fernando Corbacho'], u'2016-08-07', u'Adaptive behavior is mainly the result of adaptive brains. We go a step\nbeyond and claim that the brain does not only adapt to its surrounding reality\nbut rather, it builds itself up to constructs its own reality. That is, rather\nthan just trying to passively understand its environment, the brain is the\narchitect of its own reality in an active process where its internal models of\nthe external world frame how its new interactions with the environment are\nassimilated. These internal models represent relevant predictive patterns of\ninteraction all over the different brain structures: perceptual, sensorimotor,\nmotor, etc. The emergence of adaptive behavior arises from this\nself-constructive nature of the brain, based on the following principles of\norganization: self-experimental, self- growing, and self-repairing.\nSelf-experimental, since to ensure survival, the self-constructive brain (SCB)\nis an active machine capable of performing experiments of its own interactions\nwith the environment by mental simulation. Self-growing, since it dynamically\nand incrementally constructs internal structures in order to build a model of\nthe world as it gathers statistics from its interactions with the environment.\nSelf-repairing, since to survive the SCB must also be robust and capable of\nfinding ways to repair parts of previously working structures and hence\nre-construct a previous relevant pattern of activity.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.02229v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Inferring brain-computational mechanisms with models of activity\n  measurements', ['Nikolaus Kriegeskorte', 'Jorn Diedrichsen'], u'2016-08-05', u"High-resolution functional imaging is providing increasingly rich\nmeasurements of brain activity in animals and humans. A major challenge is to\nleverage such data to gain insight into the brain's computational mechanisms.\nThe first step is to define candidate brain-computational models (BCMs) that\ncan perform the behavioural task in question. We would then like to infer,\nwhich of the candidate BCMs best accounts for measured brain-activity data.\nHere we describe a method that complements each BCM by a measurement model\n(MM), which simulates the way the brain-activity measurements reflect neuronal\nactivity (e.g. local averaging in fMRI voxels or sparse sampling in array\nrecordings). The resulting generative model (BCM-MM) produces simulated\nmeasurements. In order to avoid having to fit the MM to predict each individual\nmeasurement channel of the brain-activity data, we compare the measured and\npredicted data at the level of summary statistics. We describe a novel\nparticular implementation of this approach, called probabilistic RSA (pRSA)\nwith measurement models, which uses representational dissimilarity matrices\n(RDMs) as the summary statistics. We validate this method by simulations of\nfMRI measurements (locally averaging voxels) based on a deep convolutional\nneural network for visual object recognition. Results indicate that the way the\nmeasurements sample the activity patterns strongly affects the apparent\nrepresentational dissimilarities. However, modelling of the measurement process\ncan account for these effects and different BCMs remain distinguishable even\nunder substantial noise. The pRSA method enables us to perform Bayesian\ninference on the set of BCMs and to recognise the data-generating model in each\ncase.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.02027v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Rare events in stochastic populations under bursty reproduction', ["Shay Be'er", 'Michael Assaf'], u'2016-08-06', u'Recently, a first step was made by the authors towards a systematic\ninvestigation of the effect of reaction-step-size noise - uncertainty in the\nstep size of the reaction - on the dynamics of stochastic populations. This was\ndone by investigating the effect of bursty influx on the switching dynamics of\nstochastic populations. Here we extend this formalism to account for bursty\nreproduction processes, and improve the accuracy of the formalism to include\nsubleading-order corrections. Bursty reproduction appears in various contexts,\nwhere notable examples include bursty viral production from infected cells, and\nreproduction of mammals involving varying number of offspring. The main\nquestion we quantitatively address is how bursty reproduction affects the\noverall fate of the population. We consider two complementary scenarios:\npopulation extinction and population survival; in the former a population gets\nextinct after maintaining a long-lived metastable state, whereas in the latter\na population proliferates despite undergoing a deterministic drift towards\nextinction. In both models reproduction occurs in bursts, sampled from an\narbitrary distribution. In the extinction problem, we show that bursty\nreproduction broadens the quasi-stationary distribution of population sizes in\nthe metastable state, which results in an exponential decrease of the mean time\nto extinction. In the survival problem, bursty reproduction yields an\nexponential increase in survival probability of the population. Close to the\nbifurcation limit our analytical results simplify considerably and are shown to\ndepend solely on the mean and variance of the burst-size distribution. Our\nformalism is demonstrated on several realistic distributions which all compare\nwell with numerical Monte-Carlo simulations.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.02083v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Responding to an enquiry concerning the geographic population structure\n  (GPS) approach and the origin of Ashkenazic Jews - a reply to Flegontov et al', ['Ranajit Das', 'Paul Wexler', 'Mehdi Pirooznia', 'Eran Elhaik'], u'2016-08-05', u'Recently, we investigated the geographical origins of Ashkenazic Jews (AJs)\nand their native language Yiddish by applying a biogeographical tool, the\nGeographic Population Structure (GPS), to a cohort of 367 exclusively\nYiddish-speaking and multilingual AJs genotyped on the Genochip microarray. GPS\nlocalized most AJs along major ancient trade routes in northeastern Turkey\nadjacent to primeval villages with names that may be derived from the word\n"Ashkenaz." These findings were compatible with the hypothesis of an\nIrano-Turko-Slavic origin for AJs and a Slavic origin for Yiddish and at odds\nwith the Rhineland hypothesis advocating a German origin of both. Our approach\nhas been recently adopted by Flegontov et al. (2016a) to trace the origin of\nthe Siberian Ket people and their language. Recently, Flegontov et al. (2016b)\nhave raised several questions concerning the accuracy of the Genochip\nmicroarray and GPS, specifically in relation to AJs and Yiddish. Although many\nof these issues have been addressed in our previous papers, we take this\nopportunity to clarify the principles of the GPS approach, review the recent\nbiogeographical and ancient DNA findings regarding AJs, and comment on the\norigin of Yiddish.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.02038v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'SANTIAGO: Spine Association for Neuron Topology Improvement and Graph\n  Optimization', ['William Gray Roncal', 'Colin Lea', 'Akira Baruah', 'Gregory D. Hager'], u'2016-08-08', u'Developing automated and semi-automated solutions for reconstructing wiring\ndiagrams of the brain from electron micrographs is important for advancing the\nfield of connectomics. While the ultimate goal is to generate a graph of neuron\nconnectivity, most prior automated methods have focused on volume segmentation\nrather than explicit graph estimation. In these approaches, one of the key,\ncommonly occurring error modes is dendritic shaft-spine fragmentation.\n  We posit that directly addressing this problem of connection identification\nmay provide critical insight into estimating more accurate brain graphs. To\nthis end, we develop a network-centric approach motivated by biological priors\nimage grammars. We build a computer vision pipeline to reconnect fragmented\nspines to their parent dendrites using both fully-automated and semi-automated\napproaches. Our experiments show we can learn valid connections despite\nuncertain segmentation paths. We curate the first known reference dataset for\nanalyzing the performance of various spine-shaft algorithms and demonstrate\npromising results that recover many previously lost connections. Our automated\napproach improves the local subgraph score by more than four times and the full\ngraph score by 60 percent. These data, results, and evaluation tools are all\navailable to the broader scientific community. This reframing of the\nconnectomics problem illustrates a semantic, biologically inspired solution to\nremedy a major problem with neuron tracking.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.02307v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Critical Telomerase Activity for Uncontrolled Cell Growth', ['Neil L Wesch', 'Laura J Burlock', 'Robert J Gooding'], u'2016-08-08', u'The lengths of the telomere regions of chromosomes in a population of cells\nare modelled using a chemical master equation formalism, from which the\nevolution of the average number of cells of each telomere length is extracted.\nIn particular, the role of the telomere-elongating enzyme telomerase on these\ndynamics is investigated. We show that for biologically relevant rates of cell\nbirth and death, one finds a critical rate, R_crit, of telomerase activity such\nthat the total number of cells diverges. Further, R_crit is similar in\nmagnitude to the rates of mitosis and cell death.

[u'Core-genome scaffold comparison reveals the prevalence that inversion\n  events are associated with pairs of inverted repeats', ['Dan Wang', 'Shuaicheng Li', 'Fei Guo', 'Lusheng Wang'], u'2016-08-08', u'Motivation: Genome rearrangement plays an important role in evolutionary\nbiology and has profound impacts on phenotype in organisms ranging from\nmicrobes to humans. The mechanisms for genome rearrangement events remain\nunclear. Lots of comparisons have been conducted among different species. To\nreveal the mechanisms for rearrangement events, comparison of different\nindividuals/strains within the same species or genus (pan-genomes) is more\nhelpful since they are much closer to each other. Results: We study the\nmechanism for inversion events via core-genome scaffold comparison of different\nstrains within the same species. We focus on two kinds of bacteria, Pseudomonas\naeruginosa and Escherichia coli, and investigate the inversion events among\ndifferent strains of the same specie. We find an interesting phenomenon that\nlong (larger than 10,000 bp) inversion regions are flanked by a pair of\nInverted Repeats (IRs) (with lengths ranging from 385 bp to 27476 bp) which are\noften Insertion Sequences (ISs).This mechanism can also explain why the\nbreakpoint reuses for inversion events happen. We study the prevalence of the\nphenomenon and find that it is a major mechanism for inversions. The other\nobservation is that for different rearrangement events such as transposition\nand inverted block interchange, the two ends of the swapped regions are also\nassociated with repeats so that after the rearrangement operations the two ends\nof the swapped regions remain unchanged. To our knowledge, this is the first\ntime such a phenomenon is reported for transposition event.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.02375v1', ['Genomics'], []]
