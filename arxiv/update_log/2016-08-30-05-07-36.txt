[u'Purification and characterization of a novel archaeo-eukaryotic primase\n  from Mimivirus', ['Jason Baby'], u'2016-08-29', u'DNA replication is a process which is common to all domains of life yet\ndifferent replication mechanisms are seen among different organisms. The\nmechanism by which Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus (APMV) undergoes\nreplication is not characterized. Presence of intergenic short terminal repeats\nreveals that Mimivirus genome assumes a unique Q shape during replication. The\nmechanism of replication on such a structure is not yet understood. With this\nbigger picture in mind, we have initiated the characterization of a putative\nprimase that is probably involved in the DNA replication and/or repair in\nMimivirus. Sequence alignment of gp0577 the protein encoded by gene L537 with\nother primases reveals that it contains the motifs common to the superfamily\nArchaeo-Eukaryotic Primase (AEP) and it aligns with Primpols, a novel type of\nprimase which has RNA and DNA polymerase activities. Our initial analysis\nrevealed that gp0577 probably exists as a dimer in its native state. We also\nidentified the presence of conserved motifs: DxD, sxH, h- and Zn binding motif\n. Using Dpni mediated site directed mutagenesis we have generated active site\nmutants for all motifs. Templates of defined sequence were utilized to\ninvestigate the mechanism of primer synthesis by gp0577. Previous studies have\nsuggested that the rate-limiting step of primer synthesis occurs during primer\ninitiation during the formation of the dinucleotide. Thus we checked the effect\nof different concentrations of rNTPs involved in initial dinucleotide synthesis\non primer synthesis. Consistent with this idea, increasing the concentration of\nNTPs required for dinucleotide synthesis increased the rate of primer\nsynthesis, whereas increasing the concentration of NTPs not involved in\ndinucleotide synthesis inhibited primer synthesis.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07967v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Water-mediated correlations in DNA-enzyme interactions', ['A. Capolupo', 'T. J. A. Craddock', 'P. Kurian', 'G. Vitiello'], u'2016-07-28', u'In this paper we consider dipole-mediated correlations between DNA and\nenzymes in the context of their water environment. Such correlations emerge\nfrom electric dipole-dipole interactions between aromatic ring structures in\nDNA and in enzymes, and they are mediated by radiative fields that stimulate\ntransitions between the $l=0$ and $l=1$ rotational levels of the molecular\nwater electric dipoles. We show that there are matching collective modes\nbetween DNA and enzyme dipole fields, and that a dynamic time-averaged\npolarization vanishes in the water dipole field only if either DNA, enzyme, or\nboth are absent from the sample. This persistent field may serve as the\nelectromagnetic image that, in popular colloquialisms about DNA biochemistry,\nallows enzymes to "scan" or "read" the double helix. Topologically nontrivial\nconfigurations in the coherent ground state requiring clamplike enzyme behavior\non the DNA may stem, ultimately, from spontaneously broken gauge symmetries.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08097v1', ['Biomolecules'], []]
[u'Matching tutor to student: rules and mechanisms for efficient two-stage\n  learning in neural circuits', ['Tiberiu Tesileanu', 'Bence Olveczky', 'Vijay Balasubramanian'], u'2016-08-29', u"Existing models of birdsong learning assume that brain area LMAN introduces\nvariability into song for trial-and-error learning. Recent data suggest that\nLMAN also encodes a corrective bias driving short-term improvements in song.\nThese later consolidate in area RA, a motor cortex analogue downstream of LMAN.\nWe develop a new model of such two-stage learning. Using a stochastic gradient\ndescent approach, we derive how 'tutor' circuits should match plasticity\nmechanisms in 'student' circuits for efficient learning. We further describe a\nreinforcement learning framework with which the tutor can build its teaching\nsignal. We show that mismatching the tutor signal and plasticity mechanism can\nimpair or abolish learning. Applied to birdsong, our results predict the\ntemporal structure of the corrective bias from LMAN given a plasticity rule in\nRA. Our framework can be applied predictively to other paired brain areas\nshowing two-stage learning.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08040v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Population Genetics with Fluctuating Population Sizes', ['Thiparat Chotibut', 'David R. Nelson'], u'2016-08-29', u'Standard neutral population genetics theory with a strictly fixed population\nsize has important limitations. An alternative model that allows independently\nfluctuating population sizes and reproduces the standard neutral evolution is\nreviewed. We then study a situation such that the competing species are neutral\nat the equilibrium population size but population size fluctuations\nnevertheless favor fixation of one species over the other. In this case, a\nseparation of timescales emerges naturally and allows adiabatic elimination of\na fast population size variable to deduce the fluctuations-induced selection\ndynamics near the equilibrium population size. The results highlight the\nincompleteness of the standard population genetics with a strictly fixed\npopulation size.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08166v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Analysis of Infectious-Recovery Epidemic Models for Membership Dynamics\n  of Online Social Networks', ['Daniel Cooney', 'Francisco Prieto-Castrillo', 'Yaneer Bar-Yam'], u'2016-08-29', u'The recent rapid growth of social media and online social networks (OSNs) has\nraised interesting questions about the spread of ideas and fads within our\nsociety. In the past year, several papers have drawn analogies between the rise\nand fall in popularity of OSNs and mathematical models used to study infectious\ndisease. One such model, the irSIR model, made use of the idea of "infectious\nrecovery" to outperform the traditional SIR model in replicating the rise and\nfall of MySpace and to predict a rapid drop in the popularity of Facebook. Here\nwe explore the irSIR model and two of its logical extensions and we\nmathematically characterize the initial and long-run behavior of these\ndynamical systems. In particular, while the original irSIR model always\npredicts extinction of a social epidemic, we construct an extension of the\nmodel that matches the exponential growth phase of the irSIR model while\nallowing for the possibility of an arbitrary proportion of infections in the\nlong run.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07870v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]
[u'Efficient parameter sensitivity computation for spatially-extended\n  reaction networks', ['Christopher Lester', 'Christian A. Yates', 'Ruth E. Baker'], u'2016-08-29', u'Reaction-diffusion models are widely used to study spatially-extended\nchemical reaction systems. In order to understand how the dynamics of a\nreaction-diffusion model are affected by changes in its input parameters,\nefficient methods for computing parametric sensitivities are required. In this\nwork, we focus on stochastic models of spatially-extended chemical reaction\nsystems that involve partitioning the computational domain into voxels.\nParametric sensitivities are often calculated using Monte Carlo techniques that\nare typically computationally expensive; however, variance reduction techniques\ncan decrease the number of Monte Carlo simulations required. By exploiting the\ncharacteristic dynamics of spatially-extended reaction networks, we are able to\nadapt existing finite difference schemes to robustly estimate parametric\nsensitivities in a spatially-extended network. We show that algorithmic\nperformance depends on the dynamics of the given network and the choice of\nsummary statistics. We then describe a hybrid technique that dynamically\nchooses the most appropriate simulation method for the network of interest. Our\nmethod is tested for functionality and accuracy in a range of different\nscenarios.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08174v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'Ultrasensitivity on signaling cascades revisited: Linking local and\n  global ultrasensitivity estimations', ['Edgar Altszyler', 'Alejandra Ventura', 'Alejandro Colman-Lerner', 'Ariel Chernomoretz'], u'2016-08-29', u"Ultrasensitive response motifs, which are capable of converting graded\nstimulus in binary responses, are very well-conserved in signal transduction\nnetworks. Although it has been shown that a cascade arrangement of multiple\nultrasensitive modules can produce an enhancement of the system's\nultrasensitivity, how the combination of layers affects the cascade's\nultrasensitivity remains an open-ended question for the general case. Here we\nhave developed a methodology that allowed us to quantify the effective\ncontribution of each module to the overall cascade's ultrasensitivity and to\ndetermine the impact of sequestration effects in the overall system's\nultrasensitivity. The proposed analysis framework provided a natural link\nbetween global and local ultrasensitivity descriptors and was particularly\nwell-suited to study the ultrasensitivity in MAP kinase cascades. We used our\nmethodology to revisit O'Shaughnessy et al. tunable synthetic MAPK cascade, in\nwhich they claim to have found a new source of ultrasensitivity:\nultrasensitivity generated de novo, which arises due to cascade structure\nitself. In this respect, we showed that the system's ultrasensitivity in its\nsingle-step cascade did not come from a cascading effect but from a hidden\nfirst-order ultrasensitivity process in one of the cascade's layer. Our\nanalysis also highlighted the impact of the detailed functional form of a\nmodule's response curve on the overall system's ultrasensitivity in cascade\narchitectures. Local sensitivity features of the involved transfer functions\nwere found to be of the uttermost importance in this kind of setting and could\nbe at the core of non-trivial phenomenology associated to ultrasensitive\nmotifs.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08007v1', ['Molecular Networks'], []]
