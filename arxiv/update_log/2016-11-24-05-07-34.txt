[u'Specificity-determining DNA triplet code for positioning of human\n  pre-initiation complex', ['Matan Goldshtein', 'David B. Lukatsky'], u'2016-11-23', u'The notion that transcription factors bind DNA only through specific,\nconsensus binding sites has been recently questioned. In a pioneering study by\nPugh and Venters no specific consensus motif for the positioning of the human\npre-initiation complex (PIC) has been identified. Here, we reveal that\nnonconsensus, statistical, DNA triplet code provides specificity for the\npositioning of the human PIC. In particular, we reveal a highly non-random,\nstatistical pattern of repetitive nucleotide triplets that correlates with the\ngenome-wide binding preferences of PIC measured by Chip-exo. We analyze the\ntriplet enrichment and depletion near the transcription start site (TSS) and\nidentify triplets that have the strongest effect on PIC-DNA nonconsensus\nbinding. Our results constitute a proof-of-concept for a new design principle\nfor protein-DNA recognition in the human genome, which can lead to a better\nmechanistic understanding of transcriptional regulation.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07776v1', ['Biomolecules', 'Quantitative Methods', 'Molecular Networks', 'Genomics'], []]

Khambhati', 'Nicholas F. Wymbs', 'Scott T. Grafton', 'Theodore D. Satterthwaite', 'Danielle S. Bassett'], u'2016-11-23', u'A major challenge in neuroimaging is understanding the mapping of\nneurophysiological dynamics onto cognitive functions. Traditionally, these maps\nhave been constructed by examining changes in the activity magnitude of regions\nrelated to task performance. Recently, network neuroscience has produced\nmethods to map connectivity patterns among many regions to certain cognitive\nfunctions by drawing on tools from network science and graph theory. However,\nthese two different views are rarely addressed simultaneously, largely because\nfew tools exist that account for patterns between nodes while simultaneously\nconsidering activation of nodes. We address this gap by solving the problem of\ncommunity detection on weighted networks with continuous (non-integer)\nannotations by deriving a generative probabilistic model. This model generates\ncommunities whose members connect densely to nodes within their own community,\nand whose members share similar annotation values. We demonstrate the utility\nof the model in the context of neuroimaging data gathered during a motor\nlearning paradigm, where edges are task-based functional connectivity and\nannotations to each node are beta weights from a general linear model that\nencoded a linear decrease in blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal with practice.\nInterestingly, we observe that individuals who learn at a faster rate exhibit\nthe greatest dissimilarity between functional connectivity and activation\nmagnitudes, suggesting that activation and functional connectivity are distinct\ndimensions of neurophysiology that track behavioral change. More generally, the\ntool that we develop offers an explicit, mathematically principled link between\nfunctional activation and functional connectivity, and can readily be applied\nto a other similar problems in which one set of imaging data offers network\ndata, and a second offers a regional attribute.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07962v1', ['Neurons and Cognition'], []]
[u'Visual motion processing and human tracking behavior', ['Anna Montagnini', 'Laurent Perrinet', 'Guillaume S Masson'], u'2016-11-23', u"The accurate visual tracking of a moving object is a human fundamental skill\nthat allows to reduce the relative slip and instability of the object's image\non the retina, thus granting a stable, high-quality vision. In order to\noptimize tracking performance across time, a quick estimate of the object's\nglobal motion properties needs to be fed to the oculomotor system and\ndynamically updated. Concurrently, performance can be greatly improved in terms\nof latency and accuracy by taking into account predictive cues, especially\nunder variable conditions of visibility and in presence of ambiguous retinal\ninformation. Here, we review several recent studies focusing on the integration\nof retinal and extra-retinal information for the control of human smooth\npursuit.By dynamically probing the tracking performance with well established\nparadigms in the visual perception and oculomotor literature we provide the\nbasis to test theoretical hypotheses within the framework of dynamic\nprobabilistic inference.

[u'Solving multi-objective optimization problems in conservation with the\n  reference point method', ['Yann Dujardin', 'Iadine Chades'], u'2016-11-23', u"Managing biodiversity extinction crisis requires wise decision-making\nprocesses able to account for the limited of resources available. In most\ndecision problems in conservation biology, several conflicting objectives have\nto be taken into account. Most methods used in conservation either provide\nsuboptimal solutions or use strong assumptions about the decision-maker's\npreferences. Our paper reviews some of the existing approaches to solve\nmulti-objective decision problems and presents new multi-objective linear\nprogramming formulations of two multi-objective optimization problems in\nconservation, allowing the use of a reference point approach. Reference point\napproaches solve multi-objective optimization problems by interactively\nrepresenting the preferences of the decision-maker with a point in the criteria\nspace, called the reference point. We modelled and solved the following two\nconservation problems: a dynamic multi-species management problem under\nuncertainty and a spatial allocation resource management problem. Results show\nthat the reference point method outperforms classic methods while illustrating\nthe use of an interactive methodology for solving combinatorial problems with\nmultiple objectives. The method is general and can be adapted to a wide range\nof ecological combinatorial problems.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07640v1', ['Populations and Evolution', 'Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'A model of the best-of-N nest-site selection process in honeybees', ['Andreagiovanni Reina', 'James A. R. Marshall', 'Vito Trianni', 'Thomas Bose'], u'2016-11-22', u"The ability of a honeybee swarm to select the best nest site plays a\nfundamental role in determining the future colony's fitness. To date, the\nnest-site selection process has mostly been modelled and theoretically analysed\nfor the case of binary decisions. However, when the number of alternative nests\nis larger than two, the decision process dynamics qualitatively change. In this\nwork, we extend previous analyses of a value-sensitive decision-making\nmechanism to a decision process among N nests. First, we present the\ndecision-making dynamics in the symmetric case of N equal-quality nests. Then,\nwe generalise our findings to a best-of-N decision scenario with one superior\nnest and N-1 inferior nests, previously studied empirically in bees and ants.\nWhereas previous binary models highlighted the crucial role of inhibitory\nstop-signalling, the key parameter in our new analysis is the relative time\ninvested by swarm members in individual discovery and in signalling behaviours.\nOur new analysis reveals conflicting pressures on this ratio in symmetric and\nbest-of-N decisions, which could be solved through a time-dependent signalling\nstrategy. Additionally, our analysis suggests how ecological factors\ndetermining the density of suitable nest sites may have led to selective\npressures for an optimal stable signalling ratio.", u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07575v1', ['Populations and Evolution'], []]

[u'Universal proximity effect in target search kinetics in the\n  few-encounter limit', ['A. Godec', 'R. Metzler'], u'2016-11-23', u'When does a diffusing particle reach its target for the first time? This\nfirst-passage time (FPT) problem is central to the kinetics of molecular\nreactions in chemistry and molecular biology. Here we explain the behavior of\nsmooth FPT densities, for which all moments are finite, and demonstrate\nuniversal yet generally non-Poissonian long-time asymptotics for a broad\nvariety of transport processes. While Poisson-like asymptotics arise\ngenerically in the presence of an effective repulsion in the immediate vicinity\nof the target, a time-scale separation between direct and reflected indirect\ntrajectories gives rise to a universal proximity effect: Direct paths, heading\nmore or less straight from the point of release to the target, become typical\nand focused, with a narrow spread of the corresponding first passage times.\nConversely, statistically dominant indirect paths exploring the system size\ntend to be massively dissimilar. The initial distance to the target\nparticularly impacts gene regulatory or competitive stochastic processes, for\nwhich often few binding events determine the regulatory outcome. The proximity\neffect is independent of details of the transport, highlighting the robust\ncharacter of the FPT features uncovered here.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07788v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
[u'A Neural Network Model to Classify Liver Cancer Patients Using Data\n  Expansion and Compression', ['Ashkan Zeinalzadeh', 'Tom Wenska', 'Gordon Okimoto'], u'2016-11-23', u'We develop a neural network model to classify liver cancer patients into\nhigh-risk and low-risk groups using genomic data. Our approach provides a novel\ntechnique to classify big data sets using neural network models. We preprocess\nthe data before training the neural network models. We first expand the data\nusing wavelet analysis. We then compress the wavelet coefficients by mapping\nthem onto a new scaled orthonormal coordinate system. Then the data is used to\ntrain a neural network model that enables us to classify cancer patients into\ntwo different classes of high-risk and low-risk patients. We use the\nleave-one-out approach to build a neural network model. This neural network\nmodel enables us to classify a patient using genomic data as a high-risk or\nlow-risk patient without any information about the survival time of the\npatient. The results from genomic data analysis are compared with survival time\nanalysis. It is shown that the expansion and compression of data using wavelet\nanalysis and singular value decomposition (SVD) is essential to train the\nneural network model.', u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07588v1', ['Quantitative Methods'], []]
