[u'Neural correlates of fears of abandonment and rejection in borderline personality disorder', ['Liana Romaniuk', 'Merrick Pope', 'Katie Nicol', 'Douglas Steele', 'Jeremy Hall'], u'2016/12/29', u'Background: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a prevalent and disabling psychiatric condition commonly associated with early life adversity. Social difficulties are a prominent symptom of BPD, particularly a fear of abandonment and rejection. There has recently been a growing interest in the neural basis of these social symptoms and their relationship to early experience.\xa0Methods: In the current study, we examined social brain function and learning in BPD using functional MRI. Participants with BPD (n=20) and healthy controls (n=16) completed a computerized parametric social exclusion task (the \u201cCyberball\u201d task). Brain activation was compared between groups and related to social symptom status and experiences of childhood trauma. Additional analyses were conducted using a reinforcement learning model treating social inclusion as a rewarding event.\xa0Results: Participants with BPD demonstrated a group effect of decreased right temporoparietal junction (TPJ) activation (p < 0.013, FWE-corrected). Increased fear of abandonment in BPD was associated with reduced inclusion-related activation of the inferior frontal gyrus (p = 0.003, FWE-corrected). Across all participants, TPJ inclusion-related activation was modified by prior experience of childhood physical neglect (p < 0.001, FWE-corrected). Reinforcement learning modelling revealed decreased midbrain responses to social inclusion in BPD participants (p = 0.028, FWE-corrected within midbrain mask), with decreased anticipatory midbrain activation in anticipation of social inclusion specifically associated with fears of abandonment (p = 0.019, FWE-corrected within a midbrain mask).\xa0Conclusions: The findings demonstrate alterations in social brain function and social reinforcement learning in BPD, which are influenced by both early life experience and symptom status.', u'/articles/1-33/v1', [], [u'Division of Psychiatry, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK', u'Medical Research Institute, University of Dundee, Dundee, UK', u'Neuroscience and Mental Health Research Institute, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK', u'MRC Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK']]

The objective of this study was to identify protein biomarkers of brain atrophy in SPMS.\r\n\xa0\nMethods\r\nWe used surface-enhanced laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry to carry out an unbiased search for serum proteins whose concentration correlated with the rate of brain atrophy, measured by serial MRI scans over a 2-year period in a well-characterized cohort of 140 patients with SPMS. \xa0Protein species were identified by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry.\r\n\xa0\nResults\r\nThere was a significant (p<0.004) correlation between the rate of brain atrophy and a rise in the concentration of proteins at 15.1 kDa and 15.9 kDa in the serum.\xa0 Tandem mass spectrometry identified these proteins as alpha-haemoglobin and beta-haemoglobin, respectively.\xa0 The abnormal concentration of free serum haemoglobin was confirmed by ELISA (p<0.001).\xa0 The serum lactate dehydrogenase activity was also highly significantly raised (p<10-12) in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis.\xa0\r\n\xa0\nConclusions\r\nThe results are consistent with the following hypothesis. In progressive multiple sclerosis, low-grade chronic intravascular haemolysis releases haemoglobin into the serum; the haemoglobin is subsequently translocated into the central nervous system (CNS) across the damaged blood-brain barrier.\xa0 In the CNS, the haemoglobin and its breakdown products, including haem and iron, contribute to the neurodegeneration and consequent brain atrophy seen in progressive disease. We postulate that haemoglobin is a source of the iron whose deposition along blood vessels in multiple sclerosis plaques is associated with neurodegeneration.\xa0 If so, then chelators of haemoglobin, rather than chelators of free serum iron, may be effective in preventing this neurodegeneration.', u'/articles/1-10/v2', [], [u'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Imperial College London, London, UK', u'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK', u'Division of Brain Sciences, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK', u'National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and Queen Square Multiple Sclerosis Centre, Department of Neuroinflammation, University College London, London, UK', u'Present address: Department of Mathematics, Brunel University, London, UK']]

This presents a problem with the gestational limit of miscarriage, and hence reporting of stillbirth, preterm birth and neonatal death. The objective of this study is to provide a synopsis of the outcome of a population cohort of pregnancies on the Thailand-Myanmar border between 24 to <28 weeks\u2019 gestation.\xa0Methods.\xa0Records from the Shoklo Malaria Research Unit Antenatal Clinics were reviewed for pregnancy outcomes in the gestational window of 24 to <28 weeks, and each record, including ultrasounds reports, were reviewed to clarify the pregnancy outcome. Pregnancies where there was evidence of fetal demise prior to 24 weeks were classified as miscarriage; those viable at 24 weeks\u2019 gestation and born before 28 weeks were coded as births, and further subdivided into live- and stillbirth.\xa0Results.\xa0Between 1995 and 2015, in a cohort of 49,931 women, 0.6% (318) of outcomes occurred from 24 to <28 weeks\u2019 gestation, and 35.8% (114) were miscarriages, with confirmatory ultrasound of fetal demise in 45.4% (49/108).

The envelope glycoprotein of several retroviruses is thought to possess potent immunosuppressive activity, mapped to a 17-amino acid residue conserved domain. Synthetic peptides corresponding to this immunosuppressive domain can inhibit lymphocyte activation, whereas mutation of key domain residues can increase the lymphocyte response to linked antigenic epitopes. Using three T cell receptors (TCRs) of defined specificity, we examine the effect of the immunosuppressive domain on the T cell response to their respective antigenic peptides. We find that fusion of a T cell epitope to the immunosuppressive domain can greatly modulate its potency. However, the effects heavily depend on the particular combination of TCR and peptide-major histocompatibility complex class II (pMHC II), and are mimicked by sequence-scrambled peptides of similar length, suggesting they operate at the level of TCR-pMHC interaction. These results offer an alternative explanation for the immunogenicity of T cell epitopes comprising the putative immunosuppressive domain, which is more consistent with an effect on peptide antigenicity than true immunosuppressive activity.', u'/articles/1-22/v1', [], [u'The Francis Crick Institute, London, UK', u'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK']]

Identifying whole exon deletions or duplications (termed exon copy number variants, \u2018exon CNVs\u2019) in exon-targeted NGS panels has proved challenging, particularly for single exon CNVs.\xa0\nMethods: We developed a tool for the Detection of Exon Copy Number variants (DECoN), which is optimised for analysis of exon-targeted NGS panels in the clinical setting. We evaluated DECoN performance using 96 samples with independently validated exon CNV data. We performed simulations to evaluate DECoN detection performance of single exon CNVs and to evaluate performance using different coverage levels and sample numbers. Finally, we implemented DECoN in a clinical laboratory that tests BRCA1 and BRCA2 with the TruSight Cancer Panel (TSCP). We used DECoN to analyse 1,919 samples, validating exon CNV detections by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA).\xa0\nResults: In the evaluation set, DECoN achieved 100% sensitivity and 99% specificity for BRCA exon CNVs, including identification of 8 single exon CNVs. DECoN also identified 14/15 exon CNVs in 8 other genes. Simulations of all possible BRCA single exon CNVs gave a mean sensitivity of 98% for deletions and 95% for duplications. DECoN performance remained excellent with different levels of coverage and sample numbers; sensitivity and specificity was >98% with the typical NGS run parameters. In the clinical pipeline, DECoN automatically analyses pools of 48 samples at a time, taking 24 minutes per pool, on average.

The published method involves manual design of the single guide RNA (sgRNA), and digestion of a large plasmid with a problematic restriction enzyme to clone the sgRNA. To increase the efficiency of this approach, we have established and optimized a PCR-based system to clone the sgRNA without restriction enzymes into a plasmid with a dominant natMX6 (nourseothricin) selection marker. We also provide a web-tool, CRISPR4P, to support the design of the sgRNAs and the primers required for the entire process of seamless DNA deletion. Moreover, we report the preparation of G1-synchronized and cryopreserved S. pombe cells, which greatly increases the efficiency and speed for transformations, and may also facilitate standard gene manipulations.

The ability to prevent phagosome-lysosome fusion is a key mechanism by which intracellular mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, achieve long-term persistence within host cells. The mechanisms underpinning this key intracellular pro-survival strategy remain incompletely understood. Host macrophages infected with persistent mycobacteria share phenotypic similarities with cells taken from patients suffering from Niemann-Pick Disease Type C (NPC), a rare lysosomal storage disease in which endocytic trafficking defects and lipid accumulation within the lysosome lead to cell dysfunction and cell death. We investigated whether these shared phenotypes reflected an underlying mechanistic connection between mycobacterial intracellular persistence and the host cell pathway dysfunctional in NPC.\xa0Methods.\xa0The induction of NPC phenotypes in macrophages from wild-type mice or obtained from healthy human donors was assessed via infection with mycobacteria and subsequent measurement of lipid levels and intracellular calcium homeostasis. The effect of NPC therapeutics on intracellular mycobacterial load was also assessed.\xa0Results.\xa0Macrophages infected with persistent intracellular mycobacteria phenocopied NPC cells, exhibiting accumulation of multiple lipid types, reduced lysosomal Ca2+ levels, and defects in intracellular trafficking. These NPC phenotypes could also be induced using only lipids/glycomycolates from the mycobacterial cell wall. These data suggest that persistent intracellular mycobacteria inhibit the NPC pathway, likely via inhibition of the NPC1 protein, and subsequently induce altered acidic store Ca2+ homeostasis. Reduced lysosomal calcium levels may provide a mechanistic explanation for the reduced levels of phagosome-lysosome fusion in mycobacterial infection. Treatments capable of correcting defects in NPC mutant cells via modulation of host cell calcium were of benefit in promoting clearance of mycobacteria from infected host cells.\xa0Conclusion.\xa0These findings provide a novel mechanistic explanation for mycobacterial intracellular persistence, and suggest that targeting interactions between the mycobacteria and host cell pathways may provide a novel avenue for development of anti-TB therapies.', u'/articles/1-18/v1', [], [u'Department of Pharmacology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK', u'School of Biosciences, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK', u'School of Medicine, Ko\xe7 University, Istanbul, Turkey', u"Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA", u'Public Health England, Salisbury, UK', u'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, USA', u'Diabetic Cardiovascular Disease Center, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, USA', u'School of Biosciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK', u'Faculty of Science Engineering and Computing, Kingston University, Kingston upon Thames, UK']]

It is a potent cytokine, with potential antiviral impact, and has been shown to play a role in modulating functions of diverse cell types, including Th1, Th2, and NK and B cells, demonstrating both pro- and anti-inflammatory roles.\xa0 In hepatocytes, it is capable of inducing signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1, STAT3 and interferon-stimulated genes.\nMethods: To address its role in viral hepatitis, the antiviral activity of IL-27 against hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) was tested in vitro using cell-culture-derived infectious HCV (HCVcc) cell culture system and the HepaRG HBV cell culture model. To further investigate the impact of IL-27 on hepatocytes, Huh7.5 cells were treated with IL-27 to analyse the differentially expressed genes by microarray analysis. Furthermore, by quantitative PCR, we analyzed the up-regulation of chemokine (CXCL)-10 in response to IL-27.\nResults: In both HCV and HBV infection models, we observed only a modest direct antiviral effect. Microarray analysis showed that the up-regulated genes mostly belonged to antigen presentation and DNA replication pathways, and involved strong up-regulation of CXCL-10, a gene associated with liver inflammation. Overall, gene set enrichment analysis showed a striking correlation of these genes with those up-regulated in response to related cytokines in diverse cell populations.\nConclusion: Our data indicate that IL-27 can have a significant pro-inflammatory impact in vitro, although the direct antiviral effect is modest.

Studies to date have identified a number of factors that might influence the brain organisation of language in bilinguals. These include proficiency, age of acquisition and exposure to the second language. The question as to whether the cerebral lateralisation of first and second languages are the same or different is as yet unresolved. Methods. We used functional transcranial Doppler sonography (FTCD) to measure cerebral lateralisation in the first and second languages in 26 high proficiency bilinguals with German or French as their first language (L1) and English as their second language (L2). FTCD was used to measure task-dependent blood flow velocity changes in the left and right middle cerebral arteries during word generation cued by single letters. Language history measures and handedness were assessed through self-report questionnaires. Results. The majority of participants were significantly left lateralised for both L1 and L2, with no significant difference in the size of asymmetry indices between L1 and L2.

Common examples are the use of chromatin immunoprecipitation for the analysis of chromatin modifications or factor binding, enzymatic digestions for chromatin structure assays, and RNA sequencing to assess gene expression changes after biological perturbations. To investigate the pattern and abundance of coverage signals across regions of interest, data are often visualized as profile plots of average signal or stacked rows of signal in the form of heatmaps. We found that available plotting software was either slow and laborious or difficult to use by investigators with little computational training, which inhibited wide data exploration. To address this need, we developed SeqPlots, a user-friendly exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization software for genomics. After choosing groups of signal and feature files and defining plotting parameters, users can generate profile plots of average signal or heatmaps clustered using different algorithms in a matter of seconds through the graphical user interface (GUI) controls. SeqPlots accepts all major genomic file formats as input and can also generate and plot user defined motif densities. Profile plots and heatmaps are highly configurable and batch operations can be used to generate a large number of plots at once. SeqPlots is available as a GUI application for Mac or Windows and Linux, or as an R/Bioconductor package. It can also be deployed on a server for remote and collaborative usage.

In particular, the ability to couple disease-causing mutations with human neuronal differentiation systems would be beneficial. Gene targeting is a well-known approach for dissecting gene function, but low rates of homologous recombination in somatic cells (including neuronal cells) have traditionally impeded the development of robust cellular models of neurological disorders. Recently, however, CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technologies have expanded the number of systems within which gene targeting is possible. Here we adopt as a model system LUHMES cells, a commercially available diploid human female mesencephalic cell line that differentiates into homogeneous mature neurons in 1-2 weeks. We describe optimised methods for transfection and selection of neuronal progenitor cells carrying targeted genomic alterations using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. By targeting the endogenous X-linked MECP2 locus, we introduced four independent missense mutations that cause the autism spectrum disorder Rett syndrome and observed the desired genetic structure in 3-26% of selected clones, including gene targeting of the inactive X chromosome. Similar efficiencies were achieved by introducing neurodevelopmental disorder-causing mutations at the autosomal EEF1A2 locus on chromosome 20. Our results indicate that efficiency of genetic \u201cknock-in\u201d is determined by the location of the mutation within the donor DNA molecule.

Careful calibration of this system will allow users to simultaneously assess sleep status in mice.

Characterising the changes in mouse embryos that result from ablation of lethal genes is a necessary first step towards uncovering their role in normal embryonic development and establishing any correlates amongst human congenital abnormalities.\nMethods: Here we present results gathered to date in the Deciphering the Mechanisms of Developmental Disorders (DMDD) programme, cataloguing the morphological defects identified from comprehensive imaging of 220 homozygous mutant embryos from 42 lethal and subviable lines, analysed at E14.5.\nResults: Virtually all embryos show multiple abnormal phenotypes and amongst the 42 lines these affect most organ systems. Within each mutant line, the phenotypes of individual embryos form distinct but overlapping sets. Subcutaneous edema, malformations of the heart or great vessels, abnormalities in forebrain morphology and the musculature of the eyes are all prevalent phenotypes, as is loss or abnormal size of the hypoglossal nerve.\nConclusions: Overall, the most striking finding is that no matter how profound the malformation, each phenotype shows highly variable penetrance within a mutant line.

However, current variant callers do not generally behave well with RNA-seq data due to reads encompassing intronic regions. We have developed a software programme called Opossum to address this problem. Opossum pre-processes RNA-seq reads prior to variant calling, and although it has been designed to work specifically with Platypus, it can be used equally well with other variant callers such as GATK HaplotypeCaller. In this work, we show that using Opossum in conjunction with either Platypus or GATK HaplotypeCaller maintains precision and improves the sensitivity for SNP detection compared to the GATK Best Practices pipeline. In addition, using it in combination with Platypus offers a substantial reduction in run times compared to the GATK pipeline so it is ideal when there are only limited time or computational resources available.', u'/articles/2-6/v1', [], [u'Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK', u'Centre for Evolution and Cancer, The Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, UK']]

[u'Tuberculosis control in postcolonial South India and beyond: Fractured sovereignties in international health, 1948-1960', ['Vivek Neelakantan'], u'2017/01/13', u'Between 1948 and 1960, South India (Madras State) and Southeast Asia emerged as global centres for tuberculosis control. This article attempts to situate tuberculosis control of these two regions within the broader context of international health. It investigates the unique ways in which tuberculosis control in Madras state reflected the inner tensions between the notional magic bullet approach, which focuses on specific cures to root out the cause of the disease, and a more holistic approach that relates disease prevention to overall well-being of the population. The implementation of tuberculosis control across South India and Southeast Asia shed light on the nature of the post-colonial state sovereignty in public health. Across India, as in Southeast Asia, the state sovereignty appertaining to the implementation of health policy was fractured, as evident in the opposition to the Bacillus Calmette\u2013Gu\xe9rin (BCG) vaccination. Based on a wide range of archival materials, this article examines tuberculosis control in South India and Southeast Asia between 1948 and 1960. It situates tuberculosis control within the context of nationalist discourse and preventive medicine. In doing so, it adds not only to the historiography of tuberculosis in non-Western contexts, which has hitherto focused on India, Sri Lanka, Africa, or the Caribbean, but also to the relatively new field of Southeast Asian medical history.', u'/articles/2-4/v1', [], [u'Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India']]
[u"Envy's pathology: Historical contexts", ['Lina Minou'], u'2017/01/09', u'This article is concerned with the physicality of envy in early modern- and eighteenth-century health contexts. The discussion brings together descriptions of the effects of envy on the body of the envier, mainly from works of physiology and health preservation, but also from literary and spiritual writings. These depictions of envy are studied beyond their symbolism and with a view to establish whether they are meaningful according to the medical paradigms of the time in which they occur. The discussion begins by acknowledging the status of envy as a \u2018disease\u2019 and looks to the specific ways in which the discourse of envy conveys this sense. I find that in the early modern discourse envy is always pathological, that is, it is experienced as disease and signifies disease in general and several diseases in particular. Moreover, envy is uniquely placed to convey pathology on account of its being connected to inherently pathogenic elements of the humoural theory. Specifically, envy is physiologically connected to melancholy, and the way it is presented comes close to attributes assigned to black bile. In addition, envy realizes pathology, the occurrence of disease in the body, by impairing the vital process of digestion and thus depriving the person from proper nourishment and sustenance. This article concludes by looking at envy within an eighteenth-century context. It finds that by the end of the century envy undergoes a significant shift away from its status as disease and considers the reasons for this change.', u'/articles/2-3/v1', [], [u'Independent Researcher, Nottingham, UK']]
[u'Cdc14 phosphatase directs centrosome re-duplication at the meiosis I to meiosis II transition in budding yeast', ['Colette Fox', 'Juan Zou', 'Juri Rappsilber', 'Adele L. Marston'], u'2017/01/05', u'Background\r\nGametes are generated through a specialized cell division called meiosis, in which ploidy is reduced by half because two consecutive rounds of chromosome segregation, meiosis I and meiosis II, occur without intervening DNA replication. This contrasts with the mitotic cell cycle where DNA replication and chromosome segregation alternate to maintain the same ploidy. At the end of mitosis, CDKs are inactivated. This low CDK state in late mitosis/G1 allows for critical preparatory events for DNA replication and centrosome/spindle pole body (SPB) duplication. However, their execution is inhibited until S phase, where further preparatory events are also prevented. This \u201clicensing\u201d ensures that both the chromosomes and the centrosomes/SPBs replicate exactly once per cell cycle, thereby maintaining constant ploidy. Crucially, between meiosis I and meiosis II, centrosomes/SPBs must be re-licensed, but DNA re-replication must be avoided. In budding yeast, the Cdc14 protein phosphatase triggers CDK down regulation to promote exit from mitosis. Cdc14 also regulates the meiosis I to meiosis II transition, though its mode of action has remained unclear.\nMethods\r\nFluorescence and electron microscopy was combined with proteomics to probe SPB duplication in cells with inactive or hyperactive Cdc14.\nResults\r\nWe demonstrate that Cdc14 ensures two successive nuclear divisions by re-licensing SPBs at the meiosis I to meiosis II transition. We show that Cdc14 is asymmetrically enriched on a single SPB during anaphase I and provide evidence that this enrichment promotes SPB re-duplication. Cells with impaired Cdc14 activity fail to promote extension of the SPB half-bridge, the initial step in morphogenesis of a new SPB. Conversely, cells with hyper-active Cdc14 duplicate SPBs, but fail to induce their separation.\nConclusion\r\nOur findings implicate reversal of key CDK-dependent phosphorylations in the differential licensing of cyclical events at the meiosis I to meiosis I transition.', u'/articles/2-2/v1', [], [u'The Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell Biology, Institute of Cell Biology, School of Biological Sciences, Edinburgh, UK', u'Chair of Bioanalytics, Institute of Biotechnology, Technische Universit\xe4t Berlin, Berlin, Germany']]

The myeloid enzyme 12/15-lipoxygenase (LOX), which generates bioactive oxidized lipids, has been implicated in numerous inflammatory diseases, with several studies demonstrating an improvement in pathology in mice lacking the enzyme. However, the ability of 12/15-LOX to directly regulate B cell function has not been studied.\n\nMethods. The influence of 12/15-LOX on B cell phenotype and function, and IgM generation, was compared using wildtype (WT) and 12/15-LOX (Alox15-/-) deficient mice. The proliferative and functional capacity of splenic CD19+ B cells was measured in vitro in response to various toll-like receptor agonists.\n\nResults. WT and Alox15-/- displayed comparable responses. However in vivo, splenic B cell numbers were significantly elevated in Alox15-/- mice with a corresponding elevation in titres of total IgM in lung, gut and serum, and lower serum IgM directed against the 12/15-LOX product, 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid-phosphatidylethanolamine (HETE-PE).\n\nDiscussion. Myeloid 12/15-LOX can regulate B cell numbers and innate immune antibody levels in vivo, potentially contributing to its ability to regulate inflammatory disease. Furthermore, the alterations seen in 12/15-LOX deficiency likely result from changes in the equilibrium of the immune system that develop from birth.

We conducted a systematic review to determine the association between anti-malarial drugs and mental and neurological impairment in humans.\xa0Methods: We systematically searched online databases, including Medline/PubMed, PsychoInfo, and Embase, for articles published up to 14th July 2016. Pooled prevalence, heterogeneity and factors associated with prevalence of mental and neurological manifestations were determined using meta-analytic techniques.\xa0Results: Of the 2,349 records identified in the initial search, 51 human studies met the eligibility criteria. The median pooled prevalence range of mental and neurological manifestations associated with antimalarial drugs ranged from 0.7% (dapsone) to 48.3% (minocycline) across all studies, while it ranged from 0.6% (pyrimethamine) to 42.7% (amodiaquine) during treatment of acute malaria, and 0.7% (primaquine/dapsone) to 55.0% (sulfadoxine) during prophylaxis. Pooled prevalence of mental and neurological manifestations across all studies was associated with an increased number of antimalarial drugs (prevalence ratio= 5.51 (95%CI, 1.05-29.04); P=0.045) in a meta-regression analysis. Headaches (15%) and dizziness (14%) were the most common mental and neurological manifestations across all studies. Of individual antimalarial drugs still on the market, mental and neurological manifestations were most common with the use of sulphadoxine (55%) for prophylaxis studies and amodiaquine (42.7%) for acute malaria studies. Mefloquine affected more domains of mental and neurological manifestations than any other antimalarial drug.\xa0Conclusions: Antimalarial drugs, particularly those used for prophylaxis, may be associated with mental and neurological manifestations, and the number of antimalarial drugs taken determines the association.

If the full benefits of childhood vaccination programmes are to be enjoyed in sub-Saharan Africa, all countries need to improve on vaccine delivery to achieve and sustain high coverage. In this paper, we review trends in vaccination coverage, dropouts between vaccine doses and explored the country-specific predictors of complete vaccination in West Africa.\xa0Methods: We utilized datasets from the Demographic and Health Surveys Program, available for Benin, Burkina Faso, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo, to obtain coverage for Bacillus Calmette-Guerin, polio, measles, and diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus (DPT) vaccines in children aged 12 \u2013 23 months. We also calculated the DPT1-to-DPT3 and DPT1-to-measles dropouts, and proportions of the fully immunised child (FIC). Factors predictive of FIC were explored using Chi-squared tests and multivariable logistic regression.\xa0Results: Overall, there was a trend of increasing vaccination coverage. The proportion of FIC varied significantly by country (range 24.1-81.4%, mean 49%). DPT1-to-DPT3 dropout was high (range 5.1% -33.9%, mean 16.3%). Similarly, DPT1-measles dropout exceeded 10% in all but four countries. Although no single risk factor was consistently associated with FIC across these countries, maternal education, delivery in a health facility, possessing a vaccine card and a recent post delivery visit to a health facility were the key predictors of complete vaccination.\xa0Conclusions: The low numbers of fully immunised children and high dropout between vaccine doses highlights weaknesses and the need to strengthen the healthcare and routine immunization delivery systems in this region.

Few of the methodological developments in MR have considered the specific situation of using genetic IVs to test the causal effect of exposures in pregnant women on postnatal offspring outcomes. In this paper, we describe specific ways in which the IV assumptions might be violated when MR is used to test such intrauterine effects. We highlight the importance of considering the extent to which there is overlap between genetic variants in offspring that influence their outcome with genetic variants used as IVs in their mothers. Where there is overlap, and particularly if it generates a strong association of maternal genetic IVs with offspring outcome via the offspring genotype, the exclusion restriction assumption of IV analyses will be violated. We recommend a set of analyses that ought to be considered when MR is used to address research questions concerned with intrauterine effects on post-natal offspring outcomes, and provide details of how these can be undertaken and interpreted. These additional analyses include the use of genetic data from offspring and fathers, examining associations using maternal non-transmitted alleles, and using simulated data in sensitivity analyses (for which we provide code). We explore the extent to which new methods that have been developed for exploring violation of the exclusion restriction assumption in the two-sample setting (MR-Egger and median based methods) might be used when exploring intrauterine effects in one-sample MR.

Reductions in antibiotic-sensitive strains have been smaller or non-existent. It has been argued that since infection control measures, such as hand hygiene, should affect resistant and sensitive strains equally, observed changes must have largely resulted from other factors, including changes in antibiotic use. We used a mathematical model to test the validity of this reasoning. Methods: We developed a mechanistic model of resistant and sensitive strains in a hospital and its catchment area. We assumed the resistant strain had a competitive advantage in the hospital and the sensitive strain an advantage in the community. We simulated a hospital hand hygiene intervention that directly affected resistant and sensitive strains equally. The annual incidence rate ratio (IRR) associated with the intervention was calculated for hospital- and community-acquired infections of both strains. Results: For the resistant strain, there were large reductions in hospital-acquired infections (0.1 \u2264 IRR \u2264 0.6) and smaller reductions in community-acquired infections (0.2 \u2264 IRR \u2264 0.9). These reductions increased in line with increasing importance of nosocomial transmission of the strain. For the sensitive strain, reductions in hospital acquisitions were much smaller (0.6 \u2264 IRR \u2264 0.9), while community acquisitions could increase or decrease (0.9 \u2264 IRR \u2264 1.2). The greater the importance of the community environment for the transmission of the sensitive strain, the smaller the reductions. Conclusions: Counter-intuitively, infection control interventions, including hand hygiene, can have strikingly discordant effects on resistant and sensitive strains even though they target them equally. This follows from differences in their adaptation to hospital- and community-based transmission. Observed lack of effectiveness of control measures for sensitive strains does not provide evidence that infection control interventions have been ineffective in reducing resistant strains.', u'/articles/2-16/v1', [], [u'Mahidol-Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, 420/6 Rajvithi Road, Tungphyathai, Bangkok, 10400, Thailand', u'Modelling and Economics Unit, National Infection Service, Public Health England, 61 Colindale Avenue, London, NW9 5EQ, UK', u'Julius Centre for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Center Utrecht, Huispost nr.

[u'Rapid inducible protein displacement in Plasmodium in vivo and in vitro using knocksideways technology', ['Katie R. Hughes', 'Andy P.

Determining the function(s) of essential proteins in Plasmodium has, until recently, been hampered by the lack of efficient conditional systems to abrogate proteins. We report the adaptation of a conditional technology, knocksideways (KS), for use in Plasmodium berghei, which can potentially rapidly inactivate proteins of interest through relocalisation. The system is induced using rapamycin, which allows for KS both in vitro and in vivo and is effective more rapidly than any other reported system. KS utilises pairs of fluorescent tags that facilitate live imaging and allows for rapid confirmation of efficient protein redistribution on live parasites, allowing for streamlined workflows. We demonstrate the characteristics of the system using transgenically expressed cytoplasmic GFP and provide proof of principle by inducibly redistributing a number of proteins with different native, subcellular locations.\xa0 We also demonstrate that KS can be applied to both mammalian and insect stages of Plasmodium. KS expands the range of (conditional) technologies for genetic manipulation of malaria parasites and offers the potential to be further developed for medium throughput phenotype screens.', u'/articles/2-18/v1', [], [u'Wellcome Centre for Molecular Parasitology, Institute of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, College of Medical Veterinary & Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, G12 8TA, UK']]

Our model exhibits competitive performance on large datasets despite implementing full Markov-Chain Monte Carlo sampling, and its unique hierarchical prior structure enables automatic determination of genes driving the bifurcation process.

It has been noted that ITN use leads to a switch from indoor to outdoor feeding among these vectors. It might be expected that outdoor feeding would undermine the effectiveness of ITNs that target indoors vectors, but data are limited. Methods: We linked homestead level geospatial data to clinical surveillance data at a primary healthcare facility in Kilifi County in order to map geographical heterogeneity in ITN effectiveness and observed vector feeding behaviour using landing catches and CDC light traps in seven selected areas of high and low ITN effectiveness.

[u'Robust long-read native DNA sequencing using the ONT CsgG Nanopore system', ['Jean-Michel Carter', 'Shobbir Hussain'], u'2017/04/06', u'Background: The ability to obtain long read lengths during DNA sequencing has several potentially important practical applications. Especially long read lengths have been reported using the Nanopore sequencing method, currently commercially available from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). However, early reports have demonstrated only limited levels of combined throughput and sequence accuracy. Recently, ONT released a new CsgG pore sequencing system as well as a 250b/s translocation chemistry with potential for improvements. Methods: We made use of such components on ONTs miniature \u2018MinION\u2019 device and sequenced native genomic DNA obtained from the near haploid cancer cell line HAP1. Analysis of our data was performed utilising recently described computational tools tailored for nanopore/long-read sequencing outputs, and here we present our key findings. Results: From a single sequencing run, we obtained ~240,000 high-quality mapped reads, comprising a total of ~2.3 billion bases. A mean read length of 9.6kb and an N50 of ~17kb was achieved, while sequences mapped to reference with a mean identity of 85%. Notably, we obtained ~68X coverage of the mitochondrial genome and were able to achieve a mean consensus identity of 99.8% for sequenced mtDNA reads.

However, relatively little is currently known about the genetic mechanisms underlying these processes. We therefore aimed to generate a detailed genomic atlas of adrenal and gonad development across these critical stages of human embryonic and fetal development.\r\nMethods: RNA was extracted from 53 tissue samples between 6-10 wpc (adrenal, testis, ovary and control). Affymetrix array analysis was performed and differential gene expression was analysed using Bioconductor. A mathematical model was constructed to investigate time-series changes across the dataset. Pathway analysis was performed using ClueGo and cellular localisation of novel factors confirmed using immunohistochemistry.\r\nResults: Using this approach, we have identified novel components of adrenal development (e.g. ASB4, NPR3) and confirmed the role of SRY as the main human testis-determining gene. By mathematical modelling time-series data we have found new genes up-regulated with SOX9 in the testis (e.g. CITED1), which may represent components of the testis development pathway. We have shown that testicular steroidogenesis has a distinct onset at around 8 wpc and identified potential novel components in adrenal and testicular steroidogenesis (e.g. MGARP, FOXO4, MAP3K15, GRAMD1B, RMND2), as well as testis biomarkers (e.g. SCUBE1). We have also shown that the developing human ovary expresses distinct subsets of genes (e.g. OR10G9, OR4D5), but enrichment for established biological pathways is limited.\r\nConclusion: This genomic atlas is revealing important novel aspects of human development and new candidate genes for adrenal and reproductive disorders.', u'/articles/2-25/v1', [], [u'Genetics and Genomic Medicine, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, London, UK', u'Developmental Biology and Cancer, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, London, UK', u'Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London, London, UK', u'Institute for Molecular Bioscience, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia', u'The Centre for Molecular Pathology, Royal Marsden Hospital, Sutton, UK']]

Common examples include the use of relative quantification to identify differentially expressed peptides and proteins in cartilage and tendon. We are working on characterising so-called \u2018neopeptides\u2019, i.e. peptides formed due to native cleavage of proteins, for example under pathological conditions. Unlike peptides typically quantified in MS workflows due to the in vitro use of an enzyme such as trypsin, a neopeptide has at least one terminus that was not due to the use of trypsin in the workflow. The identification of neopeptides within these datasets is important in understanding disease pathology, and the development of antibodies that could be utilised as diagnostic biomarkers for diseases, such as osteoarthritis, and targets for novel treatments. Our previously described neopeptide data analysis workflow was laborious and was not amenable to robust statistical analysis, which reduced confidence in the neopeptides identified. To overcome this, we developed \u2018Neopeptide Analyser\u2019, a user friendly neopeptide analysis tool used in conjunction with label-free MS quantification tool Progenesis QIP for proteomics. Neopeptide Analyser filters data sourced from Progenesis QIP output to identify neopeptide sequences, as well as give the residues that are adjacent to the peptide in its corresponding protein sequence.

However, the level of parasite mixing within and between geographical locations is likely to impact the effectiveness and durability of control interventions and thus should be taken into consideration when developing control programs.\nMethods.\xa0In order to determine the geographic-genetic patterns of Plasmodium falciparum parasite populations at a sub-national level in Kenya, we used the Sequenom platform to genotype 111 genome-wide distributed single nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) positions in 2486 isolates collected from children in 95 primary schools in western Kenya. We analysed these parasite genotypes for genetic structure using principal component analysis and assessed local and global clustering using statistical measures of spatial autocorrelation. We further examined the region for spatial barriers to parasite movement as well as directionality in the patterns of parasite movement.\nResults.\xa0We found no evidence of population structure and little evidence of spatial autocorrelation of parasite genotypes (correlation coefficients <0.03 among parasite pairs in distance classes of 1km, 2km and 5km; p value<0.01). An analysis of the geographical distribution of allele frequencies showed weak evidence of variation in distribution of alleles, with clusters representing a higher than expected number of samples with the major allele being identified for 5 SNPs. Furthermore, we found no evidence of the existence of spatial barriers to parasite movement within the region, but observed directional movement of parasites among schools in two separate sections of the region studied.\nConclusions. Our findings illustrate a pattern of high parasite mixing within the study region. If this mixing is due to rapid gene flow, then \u201cone-off\u201d targeted interventions may not be currently effective at the sub-national scale in Western Kenya, due to the high parasite movement that is likely to lead to re-introduction of infection from surrounding regions.

Leung', 'Gary E. Ward', 'Craig W. Roberts', 'Markus Meissner'], u'2017/05/19', u'Background: Micronemal proteins of the thrombospondin-related anonymous protein (TRAP) family are believed to play essential roles during gliding motility and host cell invasion by apicomplexan parasites, and currently represent major vaccine candidates against Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria. However, recent evidence suggests that they play multiple and different roles than previously assumed. Here, we analyse a null mutant for MIC2, the TRAP homolog in Toxoplasma gondii. Methods: We performed a careful analysis of parasite motility in a 3D-environment, attachment under shear stress conditions, host cell invasion and in vivo virulence. Results: We verified the role of MIC2 in efficient surface attachment, but were unable to identify any direct function of MIC2 in sustaining gliding motility or host cell invasion once initiated. Furthermore, we find that deletion of mic2 causes a slightly delayed infection in vivo, leading only to mild attenuation of virulence; like with wildtype parasites, inoculation with even low numbers of mic2 KO parasites causes lethal disease in mice. However, deletion of mic2 causes delayed host cell egress in vitro, possibly via disrupted signal transduction pathways. Conclusions: We confirm a critical role of MIC2 in parasite attachment to the surface, leading to reduced parasite motility and host cell invasion. However, MIC2 appears to not be critical for gliding motility or host cell invasion, since parasite speed during these processes is unaffected. Furthermore, deletion of MIC2 leads only to slight attenuation of the parasite.', u'/articles/2-32/v1', [], [u'Wellcome Trust Centre For Molecular Parasitology, Institute of Infection, Immunity & Inflammation, Glasgow Biomedical Research Centre, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, G12 8TA, UK', u'Strathclyde Institute of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, Glasgow, G4 0RE, UK', u'Department of Biology, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, 47405, USA', u'Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, College of Medicine, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT, 05405, USA']]

[u'RNA substrate length as an indicator of exosome interactions in vivo', ['Clementine Delan-Forino', 'Claudia Schneider', 'David Tollervey'], u'2017/05/25', u'Background: The exosome complex plays key roles in RNA processing and degradation in Eukaryotes and Archaea. Outstanding structural studies identified multiple pathways for RNA substrates into the exosome in vitro, but identifying the pathway followed by individual RNA species in vivo remains challenging.\nMethods: We attempted to address this question using RNase protection. In vivo RNA-protein crosslinking (CRAC) was applied to the exosome component Rrp44/Dis3, which has both endonuclease and exonuclease activity. During CRAC, the exosome was purified under native conditions and subjected to RNase digestion, prior to protein denaturation and cDNA cloning. The resulting high-throughput sequence reads were stratified by length of the cDNA sequence. This should reflect RNA fragment lengths, and therefore the RNA region that was protected by exosome binding. We anticipated major read lengths of ~30nt and ~10nt, reflecting the \u201ccentral channel\u201d and \u201cdirect access\u201d routes to the Rrp44 exonuclease active site observed in vitro.\nResults: Unexpectedly, no clear peak was observed at 30nt, whereas a broad peak was seen around 20nt. The expected ~10nt peak was seen, and showed strong elevation in strains lacking exonuclease activity. Unexpectedly, this peak was suppressed by point mutations in the Rrp44 endonuclease active site. This indicates that the short fragments are degraded by the exonuclease activity of Rrp44, but also suggests that at least some may be generated by endonuclease activity.\nConclusions: The absence of 30nt protected fragments may reflect obligatory binding of cofactors at the entrance to the exosome central channel in vivo. The presence of ~20nt fragments apparently indicates an access route not yet reported from in vitro studies. Confident mapping of 10nt reads is challenging, but they are clearly derived from a subset of exosome targets. In particular, pre-rRNA species, which are major exosome targets, are strongly disfavored for the generation of short reads.', u'/articles/2-34/v1', [], [u'Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell Biology, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, EH9 3BF, UK', u'Institute for Cell and Molecular Biosciences, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE2 4HH, UK']]

Accurate detection of this variant type has proved very challenging in targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) data, particularly if only a single exon is involved. Many different NGS exon CNV calling methods have been developed over the last five years. Such methods are usually evaluated using simulated and/or in-house data due to a lack of publicly-available datasets with orthogonally generated results. This hinders tool comparisons, transparency and reproducibility. To provide a community resource for assessment of exon CNV calling methods in targeted NGS data, we here present the ICR96 exon CNV validation series. The dataset includes high-quality sequencing data from a targeted NGS assay (the TruSight Cancer Panel) together with Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) results for 96 independent samples. 66 samples contain at least one validated exon CNV and 30 samples have validated negative results for exon CNVs in 26 genes. The dataset includes 46 exon CNVs in BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, EPCAM or PTEN, giving excellent representation of the cancer predisposition genes most frequently tested in clinical practice. Moreover, the validated exon CNVs include 25 single exon CNVs, the most difficult type of exon CNV to detect.

Methods: To investigate the consequence of expression of exogenous XBP1, we generated a stable cell-line expressing spliced XBP1 mRNA under the control of an inducible promotor.\xa0 Results: Following induction of expression, high levels of XBP1 protein were detected, which allowed upregulation of target genes in the absence of induction of the UPR.\xa0 Remarkably under stress conditions, the expression of exogenous XBP1 repressed splicing of endogenous XBP1 mRNA without repressing the activation of PERK.\xa0 Conclusions: These results illustrate that a feedback mechanism exists to attenuate activation of the Ire1\u03b1 ribonuclease activity in the presence of XBP1.', u'/articles/2-36/v1', [], [u'Institute of Molecular, Cellular and Systems Biology, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, G12 8QQ, UK', u'UCB Pharma Slough, Slough, SL1 3WE, UK', u'', u'', u'Fiona Chalmers', u'', u'Roles:', u'Investigation,                                                                                     Validation,                                                                                     Writing \u2013 Original Draft Preparation', u'', u'Bernadette Sweeney', u'', u'Roles:', u'Funding Acquisition,                                                                                     Project Administration', u'', u'Katharine Cain', u'', u'Roles:', u'Conceptualization,                                                                                     Funding Acquisition,                                                                                     Project Administration', u'', u'Neil J.

To create and characterise a stably integrated expression system for DT40 cells, we constructed integration cassettes for three commonly used promoter elements; CMV, CBA or CAG, and used these to stably integrate a TOPBP1 transgene at the OVA locus, a transcriptionally silent locus commonly used in DT40. We next performed a comparative analysis of protein expression levels and identified CAG as the most efficient of the promoter elements we have tested in DT40 cells. To assess whether the site of integration affected the levels of transgene expression, a second chromosomal locus, immediately adjacent to the endogenous TOPBP1 gene, was tested for CAG. No major differences in TopBP1 overexpression were observed. This confirms that use of the OVA locus for integrating transgenes is a rational choice for DT40. Finally, we demonstrate that our stably integrated overexpression system (SIOS) constructs can be efficiently excised by the induction of tamoxifen-regulated Cre expression.

Molecular and genome-scale studies of P. cynomolgi have relied on the current reference genome sequence, which remains highly fragmented with 1,649 unassigned scaffolds and little representation of the subtelomeres.\xa0\r\nMethods: Using long-read sequence data (Pacific Biosciences SMRT technology), we assembled and annotated a new reference genome sequence, PcyM, sourced from an Indian rhesus monkey. We compare the newly assembled genome sequence with those of several other Plasmodium species, including a re-annotated P. coatneyi assembly.\r\nResults: The new PcyM genome assembly is of significantly higher quality than the existing reference, comprising only 56 pieces, no gaps and an improved average gene length. Detailed manual curation has ensured a comprehensive annotation of the genome with 6,632 genes, nearly 1,000 more than previously attributed to P. cynomolgi. The new assembly also has an improved representation of the subtelomeric regions, which account for nearly 40% of the sequence. Within the subtelomeres, we identified more than 1300 Plasmodium interspersed repeat (pir) genes, as well as a striking expansion of 36 methyltransferase pseudogenes that originated from a single copy on chromosome 9.\r\nConclusions: The manually curated PcyM reference genome sequence is an important new resource for the malaria research community. The high quality and contiguity of the data have enabled the discovery of a novel expansion of methyltransferase in the subtelomeres, and illustrates the new comparative genomics capabilities that are being unlocked by complete reference genomes.', u'/articles/2-42/v1', [], [u'Biomedical Primate Research Centre, Rijswijk, Lange Kleiweg 161, 2288GJ Rijswijk, Netherlands', u'The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, Cambridge, CB10 1SA, UK', u'', u'', u'Erica M Pasini', u'', u'Roles:', u'Data Curation,                                                                                     Formal Analysis,                                                                                     Writing \u2013 Original Draft Preparation,                                                                                     Writing \u2013 Review & Editing', u'', u'Ulrike B\xf6hme', u'', u'Roles:', u'Data Curation,                                                                                     Visualization,                                                                                     Writing \u2013 Review & Editing', u'', u'Gavin G.

[u'Amodiaquine resistance in Plasmodium berghei is associated with PbCRT His95Pro mutation, loss of chloroquine, artemisinin and primaquine sensitivity, and high transcript levels of key transporters', ["Loise Ndung'u", 'Benard Langat', 'Esther Magiri', "Joseph Ng'ang'a", 'Beatrice Irungu', 'Alexis Nzila', 'Daniel Kiboi'], u'2017/06/20', u'Background: The human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum has evolved complex drug evasion mechanisms to all available antimalarials. To date, the combination of amodiaquine-artesunate is among the drug of choice for treatment of uncomplicated malaria. In this combination, a short acting, artesunate is partnered with long acting, amodiaquine for which resistance may emerge rapidly especially in high transmission settings. Here, we used a rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei ANKA as a surrogate of P. falciparum to investigate the mechanisms of amodiaquine resistance.\nMethodology: We used serial technique to select amodiaquine resistance by submitting the parasites to continuous amodiaquine pressure. We then employed the 4-Day Suppressive Test to monitor emergence of resistance and determine the cross-resistance profiles. Finally, we genotyped the resistant parasite by PCR amplification, sequencing and relative quantitation of mRNA transcript of targeted genes.\nResults: Submission of P. berghei ANKA to amodiaquine pressure yielded resistant parasite within thirty-six passages. The effective dosage that reduced 90% of parasitaemia (ED90) of sensitive line and resistant line were 4.29mg/kg and 19.13mg/kg, respectively. After freezing at -80\xbaC for one month, the resistant parasite remained stable with an ED90 of 18.22mg/kg. Amodiaquine resistant parasites are also resistant to chloroquine (6fold), artemether (10fold), primaquine (5fold), piperaquine (2fold) and lumefantrine (3fold). Sequence analysis of Plasmodium berghei chloroquine resistant transporter revealed His95Pro mutation. No variation was identified in Plasmodium berghei multidrug resistance gene-1 (Pbmdr1), Plasmodium berghei deubiquitinating enzyme-1 or Plasmodium berghei Kelch13 domain nucleotide sequences. Amodiaquine resistance is also accompanied by high mRNA transcripts of key transporters; Pbmdr1, V-type/H+ pumping pyrophosphatase-2 and sodium hydrogen ion exchanger-1 and Ca2+/H+ antiporter.\nConclusions: Selection of amodiaquine resistance yielded stable \u201cmultidrug-resistant\u2019\u2019 parasites and thus may be used to study common resistance mechanisms associated with other antimalarial drugs.

[u'PhenoPlasm: a database of disruption phenotypes for malaria parasite genes', ['Theo Sanderson', 'Julian C. Rayner'], u'2017/06/21', u'Two decades after the first Plasmodium transfection, attempts have been made to disrupt more than 3,151 genes in malaria parasites, across five Plasmodium species. While results from rodent malaria transfections have been curated and systematised, empowering large-scale analysis, phenotypic data from human malaria parasite transfections currently exists as individual reports scattered across a the literature. To facilitate systematic analysis of published experimental genetic data across Plasmodium species, we have built PhenoPlasm (http://www.phenoplasm.org), a database of phenotypes generated by transfection experiments in all Plasmodium parasites. The site provides a simple interface linking citation-backed Plasmodium reverse-genetic phenotypes to gene IDs. The database has been populated with phenotypic data on 367 P. falciparum genes, curated from 176 individual publications, as well as existing data on rodent Plasmodium species from RMgmDB and PlasmoGEM. This is the first time that all available data on P. falciparum transfection experiments has been brought together in a single place. These data are presented using ortholog mapping to allow a researcher interested in a gene in one species to see results across other Plasmodium species. The collaborative nature of the database enables any researcher to add new phenotypes as they are discovered.

We investigated the possibility that urogenital carcinoma might be clonally transmissible, spread by the direct transfer of cancer cells. Analysis of sequences at the mitochondrial DNA control region in seven matched tumour and host pairs confirmed that tumour genotypes were identical to those of their matched hosts and did not show similarity with tumours from other individuals. Thus our findings suggest that urogenital carcinoma in California sea lions is not clonally transmitted, but rather arises from transformed host cells.', u'/articles/2-46/v1', [], [u'Transmissible Cancer Group, Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB3 0ES, UK', u'The Marine Mammal Center, 2000 Bunker Road, Sausalito, CA, 94965, USA']]
[u'Cerebrospinal fluid markers to distinguish bacterial meningitis from cerebral malaria in children', ['James M. Njunge', 'Ian N. Oyaro', 'Nelson K. Kibinge', 'Martin K. Rono', 'Symon M. Kariuki', 'Charles R. Newton', 'James A. Berkley', 'Evelyn N. Gitau'], u'2017/07/03', u'Background. Few hospitals in high malaria endemic countries in Africa have the diagnostic capacity for clinically distinguishing acute bacterial meningitis (ABM) from cerebral malaria (CM). As a result, empirical use of antibiotics is necessary. A biochemical marker of ABM would facilitate precise clinical diagnosis and management of these infections and enable rational use of antibiotics.\nMethods. We used label-free protein quantification by mass spectrometry to identify cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers that distinguish ABM (n=37) from CM (n=22) in Kenyan children. Fold change (FC) and false discovery rates (FDR) were used to identify differentially expressed proteins. Subsequently, potential biomarkers were assessed for their ability to discriminate between ABM and CM using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.\nResults. The host CSF proteome response to ABM (Haemophilus influenza and Streptococcus pneumoniae) is significantly different to CM. Fifty two proteins were differentially expressed (FDR<0.01, Log FC\u22652), of which 83% (43/52) were upregulated in ABM compared to CM. Myeloperoxidase and lactotransferrin were present in 37 (100%) and 36 (97%) of ABM cases, respectively, but absent in CM (n=22). Area under the ROC curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity were assessed for myeloperoxidase (1, 1, and 1; 95% CI, 1-1) and lactotransferrin (0.98, 0.97, and 1; 95% CI, 0.96-1).\nConclusion. Myeloperoxidase and lactotransferrin have a high potential to distinguish ABM from CM and thereby improve clinical management.

[u'You can\u2019t burn the house down because of one bedbug: a qualitative study of changing gender norms in the prevention of violence against women and girls in an urban informal settlement in India', ['Nayreen Daruwalla', 'Ketaki Hate', 'Preethi Pinto', 'Gauri Ambavkar', 'Bhaskar Kakad', 'David Osrin'], u'2017/07/04', u'Background: The contribution of structural inequalities and societal legitimisation to violence against women, which 30% of women in India survived in the last year, is widely accepted. There is a consensus that interventions should aim to change gender norms, particularly through community mobilisation. How this should be done is less clear.\r\nMethods: We did a qualitative study in a large informal settlement in Mumbai, an environment in which 41% of the population live. After reviewing the anonymised records of consultations with 1653 survivors of violence, we conducted 5 focus group discussions and 13 individual interviews with 71 women and men representing a range of age groups and communities. We based the interviews on fictitious biographical vignettes to elicit responses and develop an understanding of social norms. We hypothesised that, in trying to change norms, we might exploit the disjunction between descriptive norms (beliefs about what others actually do) and injunctive norms (beliefs about what others think one ought to do), focusing program activities on evidence that descriptive norms are changing.\r\nResults: We found that descriptive and injunctive norms were relatively similar with regard to femininity, masculinity, the need for marriage and childbearing, resistance to separation and divorce, and disapproval of friendships between women and men. Some constraints on women\u2019s dress and mobility were relaxing, but there were more substantial differences between descriptive and injunctive norms around women\u2019s education, control of income and finances, and premarital sexual relationships.\r\nConclusions: Programmatically, we hope to exploit these areas of mismatch in the context of injunctive norms generally inimical to violence against women. We propose that an under-appreciated strategy is expansion of the reference group: induction of relatively isolated women and men into broader social groups whose descriptive and injunctive norms do not tolerate violence.', u'/articles/2-48/v1', [], [u'SNEHA (Society for Nutrition, Education and Health Action), Urban Health Centre,\u202860 Feet Road, Dharavi, Mumbai, Maharashtra, 400017, India', u'University College London Institute for Global Health, 30 Guilford Street, London, WC1N 1EH, UK', u'', u'', u'Nayreen Daruwalla', u'', u'Roles:', u'Conceptualization,                                                                                     Formal Analysis,                                                                                     Funding Acquisition,                                                                                     Methodology,                                                                                     Project Administration,                                                                                     Supervision,                                                                                     Validation,                                                                                     Writing \u2013 Original Draft Preparation,                                                                                     Writing \u2013 Review & Editing', u'', u'Ketaki Hate', u'', u'Roles:', u'Conceptualization,                                                                                     Data Curation,                                                                                     Formal Analysis,                                                                                     Investigation,                                                                                     Methodology,                                                                                     Validation,                                                                                     Writing \u2013 Original Draft Preparation,                                                                                     Writing \u2013 Review & Editing', u'', u'Preethi Pinto', u'', u'Roles:', u'Conceptualization,                                                                                     Data Curation,                                                                                     Formal Analysis,                                                                                     Investigation,                                                                                     Methodology,                                                                                     Project Administration,                                                                                     Validation,                                                                                     Writing \u2013 Original Draft Preparation,                                                                                     Writing \u2013 Review & Editing', u'', u'Gauri Ambavkar', u'', u'Roles:', u'Conceptualization,                                                                                     Formal Analysis,                                                                                     Project Administration,                                                                                     Validation,                                                                                     Writing \u2013 Review & Editing', u'', u'Bhaskar Kakad', u'', u'Roles:', u'Formal Analysis,                                                                                     Project Administration,                                                                                     Validation,                                                                                     Writing \u2013 Review & Editing', u'', u'David Osrin', u'', u'Roles:', u'Conceptualization,                                                                                     Formal Analysis,                                                                                     Funding Acquisition,                                                                                     Methodology,                                                                                     Supervision,                                                                                     Validation,                                                                                     Visualization,                                                                                     Writing \u2013 Original Draft Preparation,                                                                                     Writing \u2013 Review & Editing']]

This was part of a cross-sectional survey of health problems of young people, and we tested the feasibility of using the KHDSS platform for the monitoring of future interventions.\nMethods: Two facilities were used for this study. Clinical data from consenting participants aged 18-24 years were matched to KHDSS records. Data matching was achieved using national identity card numbers or otherwise using a matching algorithm based on names, sex, date of birth, location of residence and the names of other homestead members. A study form was administered to all matched patients to capture reasons for their visits and time taken to access the services. Distance to health facility from a participants\u2019 homestead was also computed.\nResults: 628 participated in the study: 386 (61%) at Matsangoni Health Centre, and 242 (39%) at Pingilikani Dispensary. 610 (97%) records were matched to the KHDSS register. Most records (605; 96%) were matched within these health facilities, while 5 (1%) were matched during homestead follow-up visits. \xa0463 (75.9%) of those matched were women. Antenatal care (25%), family planning (13%), respiratory infections (9%) and malaria (9%) were the main reasons for seeking care. Antenatal clinic visits (n=175) and malaria (n=27) were the commonest reasons among women and men, respectively. Participants took 1-1.5 hours to access the services; 490 (81.0%) participants lived within 5 kilometres of a facility.\nConclusions: With a full-time research clerk at each health facility, linking health-facility attendance data to a longitudinal HDSS platform was feasible and could be used to monitor and evaluate the impact of health interventions on health care outcomes among young people.', u'/articles/2-51/v1', [], [u'INDEPTH, Accra, Ghana', u'KEMRI/Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Kilifi, Kenya', u'London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, WC1E 7HT, UK', u'Imperial College, London, SW7 2AZ, UK']]

Rono', 'Philip Bejon', 'Jyoti Choudhary', 'Julian Rayner'], u'2017/07/17', u'Background: Many pathogens secrete effector molecules to subvert host immune responses, to acquire nutrients, and/or to prepare host cells for invasion. One of the ways that effector molecules are secreted is through extracellular vesicles (EVs) such as exosomes. Recently, the malaria parasite P. falciparum has been shown to produce EVs that can mediate transfer of genetic material between parasites and induce sexual commitment. Characterizing the content of these vesicles may improve our understanding of P. falciparum pathogenesis and virulence.\r\nMethods: Previous studies of P. falciparum EVs have been limited to long-term adapted laboratory isolates. In this study, we isolated EVs from a Kenyan P. falciparum clinical isolate adapted to in vitro culture for a short period and characterized their protein content by mass spectrometry (data are available via ProteomeXchange, with identifier PXD006925).\r\nResults: We show that P. falciparum extracellular vesicles (PfEVs) are enriched in proteins found within the exomembrane compartments of infected erythrocytes such as Maurer\u2019s clefts (MCs), as well as the secretory endomembrane compartments in the apical end of the merozoites, suggesting that these proteins play a role in parasite-host interactions. Comparison of this novel clinically relevant dataset with previously published datasets helps to define a core secretome present in Plasmodium EVs.\r\nConclusions: P. falciparum extracellular vesicles contain virulence-associated parasite proteins. Therefore, analysis of PfEVs contents from a range of clinical isolates, and their functional validation may improve our understanding of the virulence mechanisms of the parasite, and potentially identify targets for interventions or diagnostics.', u'/articles/2-50/v1', [], [u'Pwani University Bioscience Research Centre, Pwani University, Kilifi, Kenya', u'KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Kilifi, Kenya', u'Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton, Cambridge, UK']]

Crinnion', 'Sian Ellard'], u'2017/07/14', u'Copy number variants (CNV) are a major cause of disease, with over 30,000 reported in the DECIPHER database. To use read depth data from targeted Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) panels to identify CNVs with the highest degree of sensitivity, it is necessary to account for biases inherent in the data. GC content and ambiguous mapping due to repetitive sequence elements and pseudogenes are the principal components of technical variability. In addition, the algorithms used favour the detection of multi-exon CNVs, and rely on suitably matched normal dosage samples for comparison. We developed a calling strategy that subdivides target intervals, and uses pools of historical control samples to overcome these limitations in a clinical diagnostic laboratory. We compared our enhanced strategy with an unmodified pipeline using the R software package ExomeDepth, using a cohort of 109 heterozygous CNVs (91 deletions, 18 duplications in 26 genes), including 25 single exon CNVs. The unmodified pipeline detected 104/109 CNVs, giving a sensitivity of 89.62% to 98.49% at the 95% confidence interval. The detection of all 109 CNVs by our enhanced method demonstrates 95% confidence the sensitivity is \u226596.67%, allowing NGS read depth analysis to be used for CNV detection in a clinical diagnostic setting.', u'/articles/2-49/v1', [], [u'Exeter Molecular Genetics Service, Royal Devon & Exeter NHS Foundation Trust, Exeter, EX2 5DW, UK', u'Institute of Biomedical and Clinical Science, University of Exeter, Exeter, EX2 5DW, UK', u'School of Medicine, University of Leeds, Leeds, LS9 7TF, UK', u'Yorkshire Regional Genetics Service, St James\u2019s University Hospital, Leeds, LS9 7TF, UK']]
[u'Further investigations of the W-test for pairwise epistasis testing', ['Richard Howey', 'Heather J. Cordell'], u'2017/07/21', u'Background: In a recent paper, a novel W-test for pairwise epistasis testing was proposed that appeared, in computer simulations, to have higher power than competing alternatives. Application to genome-wide bipolar data detected significant epistasis between SNPs in genes of relevant biological function. Network analysis indicated that the implicated genes formed two separate interaction networks, each containing genes highly related to autism and neurodegenerative disorders.\nMethods: Here we investigate further the properties and performance of the W-test via theoretical evaluation, computer simulations and application to real data.\nResults: We demonstrate that, for common variants, the W-test is closely related to several existing tests of association allowing for interaction, including logistic regression on 8 degrees of freedom, although logistic regression can show inflated type I error for low minor allele frequencies,\xa0 whereas the W-test shows good/conservative type I error control. Although in some situations the W-test can show higher power, logistic regression is not limited to tests on 8 degrees of freedom but can instead be taylored to impose greater structure on the assumed alternative hypothesis, offering a power advantage when the imposed structure matches the true structure.\nConclusions: The W-test is a potentially useful method for testing for association - without necessarily implying interaction - between genetic variants disease, particularly when one or more of the genetic variants are rare. For common variants, the advantages of the W-test are less clear, and, indeed, there are situations where existing methods perform better. In our investigations, we further uncover a number of problems with the practical implementation and application of the W-test (to bipolar disorder) previously described, apparently due to inadequate use of standard data quality-control procedures. This observation leads us to urge caution in interpretation of the previously-presented results, most of which we consider are highly likely to be artefacts.', u'/articles/2-54/v1', [], []]

Although many cross-sectional studies have been carried out, relatively little is known about antecedent factors influencing the development of ELOC.\nMethods:\xa0Over 12,000 pregnant women who enrolled in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) in south-west England, had completed a brief version of the Adult Nowicki-Strickland Internal-External LOC scale, together with detailed questions concerning their own parents and childhood. \xa0A series of hypothesis-free structured backwards stepwise logistic regression analyses used an exposome approach with ELOC as the outcome.\nResults:\xa0Significant positive associations were found with smoking of the parents of the surveyed women, including prenatal exposure, and their own onset of regular smoking in mid-childhood (6-11 years). Increased odds of ELOC were also found with the absence of their fathers in early childhood, presence of older siblings, and with being born and brought up in the same area as they resided in at the time surveyed. Protective influences in the surveyed women included positive rating of their mother\u2019s care, having a relatively educated mother, attending boarding school, their own age (the older they were, the less likely were they to have an external orientation), having a mentally ill parent, a sibling hospitalized or a relative die.\nConclusions: There are two conclusions: (i) that not all stressful events contribute to the development of ELOC and it would be essential for models of antecedents of ELOC to take note of this complexity, and (ii) there are consistent (albeit unexpected) findings that highlight associations with cigarette smoke exposure of the woman from fetal life through to when starting to smoke regularly herself in mid-childhood.

[u'Primordial Krebs-cycle-like non-enzymatic reactions detected by mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance', ['Markus A. Keller', 'Paul C. Driscoll', 'Christoph Messner', 'Markus Ralser'], u'2017/07/21', u'Background: Metabolism is the process of nutrient uptake and conversion, and executed by the metabolic network. Its evolutionary precursors most likely originated in non-enzymatic chemistry. To be exploitable in a Darwinian process that forms a metabolic pathway, non-enzymatic reactions need to form a chemical network that produces advantage-providing metabolites in a single, life compatible condition. In a hypothesis-generating, large-scale experiment, we recently screened iron and sulfur-rich solutions, and report that upon the formation of sulfate radicals, Krebs cycle intermediates establish metabolism-like non-enzymatic reactivity. A challenge to our results claims that the results obtained by liquid chromatography-selective reaction monitoring (LC-SRM) would not be reproducible by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-NMR). Methods: This study compared the application of the two techniques to the relevant samples. Results: We detect hundred- to thousand-fold differences in the specific limits of detection between LC-SRM and 1H-NMR to detect Krebs cycle intermediates. Further, the use of 1H-NMR was found generally problematic to characterize early metabolic reactions, as Archean-sediment typical iron concentrations cause paramagnetic signal suppression. Consequently, we selected non-enzymatic Krebs cycle reactions that fall within the determined technical limits. We confirm that these proceed unequivocally as evidenced by both LC-SRM and 1H-NMR. Conclusions: These results strengthen our previous conclusions about the existence of unifying reaction conditions that enables a series of co-occurring metabolism-like non-enzymatic Krebs cycle reactions. We further discuss why constraints applying to metabolism disentangle concentration from importance of any reaction intermediates, and why evolutionary precursors to metabolic pathways must have had much lower metabolite concentrations compared to modern metabolic networks. Research into the chemical origins of life will hence miss out on the chemistry relevant for metabolism if its focus is restricted solely to highly abundant and unreactive metabolites, including when it ignores life-compatibility of the reaction conditions as an essential constraint in enzyme evolution.', u'/articles/2-52/v1', [], [u'Division of Human Genetics, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, 6020, Austria', u'Department of Biochemistry, Cambridge Systems Biology Centre, Cambridge, CB2 1GA, UK', u'Metabolomics Science Technology Platform, The Francis Crick Institute, London, NW1 1AT, UK', u'The Molecular Biology of Metabolism Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute, London, NW1 1AT , UK']]

Despite these difficulties, little is known about how people with NES experience healthcare encounters.\r\n\xa0\r\nMethods:\xa0Using a thematic discourse analysis approach, we analysed the free-text survey responses of 135 people with NES and asked: what kind of challenges do people living with this condition encounter when interacting with health professionals, and how do they experience the consequences of difficult interactions? We explore their experiences by interpreting the latent meaning of participants\u2019 texts from a social-constructionist perspective on health and illness.\r\n\xa0\r\nResults:\xa0The overarching narrative depicts a fundamental breakdown in patient-provider relationships. According to our data, the negative experiences of study participants emerge from more than practitioners\u2019 lack of awareness of NES and access to information about the condition - to the extent that it is available. In examining the challenges people with NES encounter when interacting with health professionals, their main experiences centre on blame and humiliation.

Perceived to lack medical, moral and credible status, participants describe practitioners who treat them with disrespect, and they recount conduct that defies ethical and professional obligations and standards. These encounters can have wide-ranging adverse consequences for patients: emotionally, physically, and for their future healthcare.

A single, geo-coded continental inventory of anophelines using all available published and unpublished data has not been undertaken since the 1960s.\nMethods: We have searched African, European and World Health Organization archives to identify unpublished reports on anopheline surveys in 48 sub-Saharan Africa countries. This search was supplemented by identification of reports that formed part of post-graduate theses, conference abstracts, regional insecticide resistance databases and more traditional bibliographic searches of peer-reviewed literature. Finally, a check was made against two recent repositories of dominant malaria vector species locations (circa 2,500). Each report was used to extract information on the survey dates, village locations (geo-coded to provide a longitude and latitude), sampling methods, species identification methods and all anopheline species found present during the survey. Survey records were collapsed to a single site over time.\xa0\xa0\xa0\nResults: The search strategy took years and resulted in 13,331 unique, geo-coded survey locations of anopheline vector occurrence between 1898 and 2016. A total of 12,204 (92%) sites reported the presence of 10 dominant vector species/sibling species; 4,473 (37%) of these sites were sampled since 2005. 4,442 (33%) sites reported at least one of 13 possible secondary vector species; 1,107 (25%) of these sites were sampled since 2005. Distributions of dominant and secondary vectors conform to previous descriptions of the ecological ranges of these vectors.\nConclusion: We have assembled the largest ever geo-coded database of anophelines in Africa, representing a legacy dataset for future updating and identification of knowledge gaps at national levels.

Here we present the ABACUS study (AntiBiotic ACcess and USe), which employs a unique approach and infrastructure, enabling quantitative validation, contextualization of determinants, and cross-continent comparisons of antibiotic access and use.

Results from this sample will be validated against a systematically conducted inventory of suppliers. All potential antibiotic suppliers will be mapped and characterized. Subsequently, their supply of antibiotics to the community will be measured through customer exit interviews, which tend to be more reliable than bulk purchase or sales data. Discrepancies identified between reported and observed antibiotic practices will be investigated in further qualitative interviews.

In this study, we reviewed pediatric admission data from the Clinical Information Network (CIN) to help determine hospital and region based prevalence of rickets in three regions of Kenya (Central Kenya, Western Kenya and Nairobi County). We also examine the association of rickets with other diagnosis, such as malnutrition and pneumonia, and study the effect of rickets on regional hospital stays.\nMethods: We analyzed discharge records for children aged 1 month to 5 years from county (formerly district) hospitals in the CIN, with admissions from February 1st 2014 to February 28th 2015. The strength of the association between rickets and key demographic factors, as well as with malnutrition and pneumonia, was assessed using odds ratios. The Fisher exact test was used to test the significance of the estimated odd ratios. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to analyze length of hospital stays.\nResults: There was a marked difference in prevalence across the three regions, with Nairobi having the highest number of cases of rickets at a proportion of 4.01%, followed by Central Region at 0.92%. Out of 9756 admissions in the Western Region, there was only one diagnosis of rickets. Malnutrition was associated with rickets; this association varied regionally. Pneumonia was found to be associated with rickets in Central Kenya. Children diagnosed with rickets had longer hospital stays, even when cases of malnutrition and pneumonia were excluded in the analysis.\nConclusion: There was marked regional variation in hospital based prevalence of rickets, but in some regions it is a common clinical diagnosis suggesting the need for targeted public health interventions. Factors such as maternal and child nutrition, urbanization and cultural practices might explain these differences.', u'/articles/2-64/v1', [], [u'Kenya Medical Research Institute-Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Nairobi, Kenya', u'Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 7BN, UK']]
[u'Oral rehydration of malnourished children with diarrhoea and dehydration: A systematic review', ['Kirsty A. Houston', 'Jack G. Gibb', 'Kathryn Maitland'], u'2017/08/18', u'Background: Diarrhoea complicates over half of admissions to hospital with severe acute malnutrition (SAM). World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for the management of dehydration recommend the use of oral rehydration with ReSoMal (an oral rehydration solution (ORS) for SAM), which has lower sodium (45mmols/l) and higher potassium (20mmols/l) content than standard ORS. The composition of ReSoMal was designed specifically to address theoretical risks of sodium overload and potential under-treatment of severe hypokalaemia with rehydration using standard ORS. In African children, severe hyponatraemia at admission is a major risk factor for poor outcome in children with SAM complicated by diarrhoea. We therefore reviewed the evidence for oral rehydration therapy in children with SAM.\nMethods: We conducted a systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on 18th July 2017 comparing different oral rehydration solutions in severely malnourished children with diarrhoea and dehydration, using standard search terms. The author assessed papers for inclusion. The primary endpoint was frequency of hyponatraemia during rehydration.\nResults: Six RCTs were identified, all published in English and conducted in low resource settings in Asia. A range of ORS were evaluated in these studies, including standard ORS, hypo-osmolar ORS and ReSoMal. Hyponatraemia was observed in two trials evaluating ReSoMal, three children developed severe hyponatraemia with one experiencing convulsions. Hypo-osmolar ORS was found to have benefits in time to rehydration, reduction of stool output and duration of diarrhoea. No trials reported over-hydration or fatalities.\nConclusions: Current WHO guidelines strongly recommend the use of ReSoMal based on low quality of evidence. Studies indicate a significant risk of hyponatraemia on ReSoMal in Asian children, none have been conducted in Africa, where SAM mortality remains high. Further research should be conducted in Africa to evaluate optimal ORS for children with SAM and to generate evidence based, practical guidelines.', u'/articles/2-66/v1', [], [u'KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Kilifi, 80108, Kenya', u'Department of Paediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College, London, W2 1PG, UK']]
[u'Intravenous rehydration of malnourished children with acute gastroenteritis and severe dehydration: A systematic review', ['Kirsty A. Houston', 'Jack G. Gibb', 'Kathryn Maitland'], u'2017/08/18', u'Background: Rehydration strategies in children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) and severe dehydration are extremely cautious. The World Health Organization (WHO) SAM guidelines advise strongly against intravenous fluids unless the child is shocked or severely dehydrated and unable to tolerate oral fluids. Otherwise, guidelines recommend oral or nasogastric rehydration using low sodium oral rehydration solutions. There is limited evidence to support these recommendations.\nMethods: We conducted a systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies on 15th June 2017 comparing different strategies of rehydration therapy in children with acute gastroenteritis and severe dehydration, specifically relating to intravenous rehydration, using standard search terms. Two authors assessed papers for inclusion. The primary endpoint was evidence of fluid overload.\nResults: Four studies were identified, all published in English, including 883 children, all of which were conducted in low resource settings. Two were randomised controlled trials and two observational cohort studies, one incorporated assessment of myocardial and haemodynamic function. There was no evidence of fluid overload or other fluid-related adverse events, including children managed on more liberal rehydration protocols. Mortality was high overall, and particularly in children with shock managed on WHO recommendations (day-28 mortality 82%). There was no difference in safety outcomes when different rates of intravenous rehydration were compared.\nConclusions: The current \u2018strong recommendations\u2019 for conservative rehydration of children with SAM are not based on emerging evidence. We found no clinical trials providing a direct assessment of the current WHO guidelines, and those that were available suggested that these children have a high mortality and remain fluid depleted on current therapy. Recent studies have reported no evidence of fluid overload or heart failure with more liberal rehydration regimens.

This study was conducted to determine if trichiasis surgery improves participation in productive and leisure activities, and ability to perform activities without difficulty or assistance.\nMethods: We recruited 1000 adults with trichiasis (cases) and 200 comparison participants, matched to every fifth trichiasis case on age (+/- two years), sex and location. The \u2018Stylised Activity List\u2019 tool, developed for the World Bank Living Standard Measurement Survey, was adapted to collect data on activity in the last week (participation in activity, difficulty with activity, requirement of assistance for activity), at baseline and 12 months later. All trichiasis cases received trichiasis surgery at baseline. Random effect logistic regression was used to compare cases and comparison participants.\nResults: There was strong evidence that trichiasis surgery substantially improves the ability of trichiasis cases to perform all the productive and leisure activities investigated without difficulty, with large increases in processing agricultural products, 21.1% to 87.0% (p<0.0001), farming, 19.1% to 82.4% (p<0.0001), and fetching wood, 25.3% to 86.0% (p<0.0001). Similarly, there was a significant increase in the proportion of cases who could perform activities without assistance, with the largest increases in animal rearing 54.2% to 92.0% (p<0.0001) and farming 73.2% to 96.4% (p<0.0001). There was no change in the proportion of comparison participants performing activities without difficulty or assistance. The change in most of the activities in cases was independent of visual acuity improvement and recurrent TT at 12 months. One year after trichiasis surgery, the proportion of cases reporting ocular pain reduced from 98.9% to 33.7% (p<0.0001).\nConclusions: Eyelid surgery for TT improves functional capabilities regardless of vision gains.

Moreover, substantial uncertainty remains about the causal relevance of increased bone mineral density for T2D and CHD, which can be assessed by Mendelian randomisation studies.\xa0\nMethods: We identified 235 independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated at p<5\xd710-8 with estimated heel bone mineral density (eBMD) in 116,501 individuals from the UK Biobank study, accounting for 13.9% of eBMD variance. For each eBMD-associated SNP, we extracted effect estimates from the largest available GWAS studies for T2D (DIAGRAM: n=26,676 T2D cases and 132,532 controls) and CHD (CARDIoGRAMplusC4D: n=60,801 CHD cases and 123,504 controls). A two-sample design using several Mendelian randomization approaches was used to investigate the causal relevance of eBMD for risk of T2D and CHD. In addition, we explored the relationship of eBMD, instrumented by the 235 SNPs, on 12 cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors. Finally, we conducted Mendelian randomization analysis in the reverse direction to investigate reverse causality.\nResults: Each one standard deviation increase in genetically instrumented eBMD (equivalent to 0.14 g/cm2) was associated with an 8% higher risk of T2D (odds ratio [OR] 1.08; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02 to 1.14; p=0.012) and 5% higher risk of CHD (OR 1.05; 95%CI: 1.00 to 1.10; p=0.034). Consistent results were obtained in sensitivity analyses using several different Mendelian randomization approaches. Equivalent increases in eBMD were also associated with lower plasma levels of HDL-cholesterol and increased insulin resistance. Mendelian randomization in the reverse direction using 94 T2D SNPs or 52 CHD SNPs showed no evidence of reverse causality with eBMD.\nConclusions: These findings suggest a causal relationship between elevated bone mineral density with risks of both T2D and CHD.', u'/articles/2-68/v1', [], [u'Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 7BN, UK', u'Oxford Centre for Diabetes, Endocrinology, and Metabolism, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 7LE, UK', u'Big Data Institute, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 7FZ, UK', u'Clinical Trial Service Unit and Epidemiological Studies Unit, Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 7LF, UK', u'Centre for Biotechnology and Bioinformatics, University of Nairobi, Nairobi, Kenya', u'National Institute of Health Research Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, Oxford, OX3 7LE, UK', u'Medical Research Council Population Health Research Unit, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 7LF, UK']]

Dietary methyl donor restriction is used to induce a NAFLD/non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) phenotype in rodents, however the extent to which this model reflects human NAFLD remains incompletely understood. To address this, we undertook hepatic transcriptional profiling of methyl donor restricted rodents and compared these to published human NAFLD datasets. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0\nMethods: Adult C57BL/6J mice were maintained on control, choline deficient (CDD) or methionine/choline deficient (MCDD) diets for four weeks; the effects on methyl donor and lipid biology were investigated by bioinformatic analysis of hepatic gene expression profiles followed by a cross-species comparison with human expression data of all stages of NAFLD.\nResults: Compared to controls, expression of the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) packaging carboxylesterases (Ces1d, Ces1f, Ces3b) and the NAFLD risk allele Pnpla3 were suppressed in MCDD; with Pnpla3 and the liver predominant Ces isoform, Ces3b, also suppressed in CDD. With respect to 1-carbon metabolism, down-regulation of Chka, Chkb, Pcty1a, Gnmt and Ahcy with concurrent upregulation of Mat2a suggests a drive to maintain S-adenosylmethionine levels. There was minimal similarity between global gene expression patterns in either dietary intervention and any stage of human NAFLD, however some common transcriptomic changes in inflammatory, fibrotic and proliferative mediators were identified in MCDD, NASH and HCC.\nConclusions: This study suggests suppression of VLDL assembly machinery may contribute to hepatic lipid accumulation in these models, but that CDD and MCDD rodent diets are minimally representative of human NAFLD at the transcriptional level.', u'/articles/2-67/v1', [], [u"University of Edinburgh/British Heart Foundation Centre for Cardiovascular Science, The Queen's Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK", u"MRC Centre for Inflammation Research, The Queen's Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK", u'School of Biomedical Sciences, Biomedical Sciences Research Institute, University of Ulster, Coleraine, County Londonderry, UK', u'MRC Human Genetics Unit, IGMM, Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, UK', u"Centre for Immunity, Infection and Evolution, The Queen's Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"]]

In pregnant women, microcytic anemia caused by hemoglobinopathies mimics iron deficiency, complicating diagnosis and treatment. Anemia during pregnancy is associated with morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to characterize the prevalence of G6PD deficiency, hemoglobinopathies, ABO and Rhesus blood groups among the pregnant population living along the Thailand-Myanmar border. Pregnant women attending antenatal clinics in this area belong to several distinct ethnic groups.\nMethods: Data was available for 13,520 women attending antenatal care between July 2012 and September 2016. Screening for G6PD deficiency was done by fluorescent spot test routinely. G6PD genotyping and quantitative phenotyping by spectrophotometry were analyzed in a subsample of women. Hemoglobin variants were diagnosed by HPLC or capillary electrophoresis and molecular methods. Blood groups were diagnosed by agglutination test. The prevalence and distribution of inherited red blood cell disorders and blood groups was analyzed with respect to ethnicity.\nResults: G6PD deficiency was common, especially in the Sgaw Karen ethnic group, in whom the G6PD Mahidol variant allele frequency was 20.7%. Quantitative G6PD phenotyping showed that 60.5% of heterozygote women have an intermediate enzymatic activity between 30% and 70% of the population median.

The intensification of insecticide use for both public health and agriculture in Africa has contributed to growing insecticide resistance. Today, resistance to World Health Organization (WHO)-approved insecticide classes is widespread. In an agricultural area of Southern C\xf4te d\u2019Ivoire, the main malaria vector Anopheles coluzzii shows multiple resistance across insecticides mediated by both target site mutation and metabolic mechanisms. To plan new vector control strategies and avert future resistance liabilities caused by cross-resistance mechanisms extant within populations, it is crucial to monitor the development and spread of both resistance and mechanisms.\nMethods. \xa0Larvae of Anopheles gambiae were collected from natural breeding sites in Tiassal\xe9 and Elibou, between April and November 2016 and raised to adults. Adult female non-blood fed mosquitoes, three to five days old, were exposed to deltamethrin in WHO bioassays. Extracted DNA samples from exposed mosquitoes were used for species characterisation and genotyping.\nResults. Most adult An. gambiae tested were resistant to deltamethrin, with mortality rates of only 25% in Tiassal\xe9 and 4.4% in Elibou. Molecular analysis of DNA from samples tested showed the presence of both An. coluzzii and An. gambiae s.s in Elibou and only An. coluzzii for Tiassal\xe9. As previously, the L1014F kdr mutation was present at high frequency (79%) in Tiassal\xe9 and the L1014S mutation was absent. The N1575Y mutation, which amplifies resistance conferred by L1014F was detected in a single unique individual from a Tiassal\xe9 An. coluzzii female whereas in Elibou 1575Y was present in 10 An. gambiae s.s, but not in An. coluzzii.\nConclusion.

[u'Comparative genomics identifies male accessory gland proteins in five Glossina species', ['Muna F. Abry', 'Kelvin M. Kimenyi', 'Daniel Masiga', 'Benard W. Kulohoma'], u'2017/08/30', u'Accessory gland proteins (ACPs) are important reproductive proteins produced by the male accessory glands (MAGs) of most insect species. These proteins are essential for male insect fertility, and are transferred alongside semen to females during copulation. ACPs are poorly characterized in Glossina species (tsetse fly), the principal vector of the parasite that causes life-threatening Human African Trypanosomiasis and Animal trypanosomiasis in endemic regions in Africa. The tsetse fly has a peculiar reproductive cycle because of the absence of oviposition. Females mate once and store sperm in a spermathecal, and produce a single fully developed larva at a time that pupates within minutes of exiting their uterus. This slow reproductive cycle, compared to other insects, significantly restricts reproduction to only 3 to 6 larvae per female lifespan. This unique reproductive cycle is an attractive vector control strategy entry point. We exploit comparative genomics approaches to explore the diversity of ACPs in the recently available whole genome sequence data from five tsetse fly species (Glossina morsitans, G. austeni, G. brevipalpis, G. pallidipes and G. fuscipes). We used previously described ACPs in Drosophila melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae as reference sequences. We identified 36, 27, 31, 29 and 33 diverse ACP orthologous genes in G. austeni, G. brevipalpis, G. fuscipes, G. pallidipes and G. morsitans genomes respectively, which we classified into 21 functional classes.

The number of people with podoconiosis was then estimated using a gridded map of adult population density for 2015.\r\nResults: Podoconiosis is endemic in 345 districts in Ethiopia: 144 in Oromia, 128 in Southern Nations, Nationalities and People\u2019s [SNNP], 64 in Amhara, 4 in Benishangul Gumuz, 4 in Tigray and 1 in Somali Regional State. Nationally, our estimates suggest that 1,537,963 adults (95% confidence intervals, 290,923-4,577,031 adults) were living with podoconiosis in 2015. Three regions (SNNP, Oromia and Amhara) contributed 99% of the cases. The highest proportion of individuals with podoconiosis resided in the SNNP (39%), while 32% and 29% of people with podoconiosis resided in Oromia and Amhara Regional States, respectively. Tigray and Benishangul Gumuz Regional States bore lower burdens, and in the remaining regions, podoconiosis was almost non-existent.\xa0\r\nDiscussion: The estimates of podoconiosis cases presented here based upon the combination of currently available epidemiological data and a robust modelling approach clearly show that podoconiosis is highly endemic in Ethiopia.

Telomerase functions to add telomeric repeats back onto the ends of chromosomes, however non-canonical roles of components of telomerase have recently been suggested.\r\nMethods: Here we use a zebrafish telomerase mutant which harbours a nonsense mutation in tert to investigate the adult phenotypes of fish derived from heterozygous parents of different ages. Furthermore we use whole genome sequencing data to estimate average telomere lengths.\r\nResults: We show that homozygous offspring from older heterozygotes exhibit signs of body wasting at a younger age than those of younger parents, and that offspring of older heterozygous parents weigh less irrespective of genotype. We also demonstrate that tert homozygous mutant fish have a male sex bias, and that clutches from older parents also have a male sex bias in the heterozygous and wild-type populations. Telomere length analysis reveals that the telomeres of younger heterozygous parents are shorter than those of older heterozygous parents.\r\nConclusions: These data indicate that the phenotypes observed in offspring from older parents cannot be explained by telomere length. Instead we propose that Tert functions outside of telomere length maintenance in an age-dependent manner to influence the adult phenotypes of the next generation.', u'/articles/2-77/v1', [], [u'Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton, UK', u'Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK', u'Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK']]

Rapid diagnostics of viral pathogens is essential to avoid unnecessary antibiotic treatment, thereby slowing down antibiotic-resistance. We evaluated the diagnostic performance of the Luminex xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel FAST v2 against viral specific PCR as reference assays for ARI in Vietnam.\r\nMethods: Four hundred and forty two nose and throat swabs were collected in viral transport medium, and were tested with Luminex xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel FAST v2. Multiplex RT-PCR and single RT-PCR were used as references.\xa0 \xa0\r\nResults: Overall, viral pathogens were detected in a total count of 270/294 (91.8%, 95% CI 88.1-94.7) by the Luminex among reference assays, whilst 112/6336 (1.8%, 95% CI, 1.4-2.1) of pathogens were detected by the Luminex, but not by reference assays. Frequency of pathogens detected by Luminex and reference assays was 379 and 292, respectively. The diagnostic yield was 66.7% (295/442, 95%CI 62.1-71.1%) for the Luminex assay and 54.1% (239/442, 95% CI, 49.3-58.8%) for reference assays.

Eliminating falciparum malaria in the GMS while drugs still retain enough efficacy could prevent global spread of antimalarial resistance. Eliminating malaria rapidly requires targeting the reservoir of asymptomatic parasite carriers.\r\nThis pilot trial aimed to evaluate the acceptability, safety, feasibility and effectiveness of mass-drug administration (MDA) in reducing malaria in four villages in Eastern Myanmar.\nMethods: Villages with \u226530% malaria prevalence were selected. Long-lasting insecticidal bednets (LLINs) and access to malaria early diagnosis and treatment (EDT) were provided. Two villages received MDA immediately and two were followed for nine months pre-MDA. MDA consisted of a 3-day supervised course of \xa0dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine and single low-dose primaquine administered monthly for three months. Adverse events (AE) were monitored by interviews and consultations. Malaria prevalence was assessed by ultrasensitive PCR quarterly for 24 months. Symptomatic malaria incidence,entomological indices, and antimalarial resistance markers were monitored.\nResults: MDA was well tolerated. There were no serious AE and mild to moderate AE were reported in 5.6%(212/3931) interviews. In the smaller villages, participation to three MDA courses was 61% and 57%, compared to 28% and 29% in the larger villages. Baseline prevalence was higher in intervention than in control villages (18.7% (95%CI=16.1-21.6) versus 6.8%(5.2-8.7), p<0.0001) whereas three months after starting MDA, prevalence was lower in intervention villages (0.4%(0.04-1.3) versus 2.7%(1.7-4.1), p=0.0014). After nine months the difference was no longer significant (2.0%(1.0-3.5) versus 0.9%(0.04-1.8), p=0.10). M0-M9 symptomatic falciparum incidence was similar between intervention and control. Before/after MDA comparisons showed that asymptomatic P. falciparum carriage and anopheline vector positivity decreased significantly whereas prevalence of the artemisinin-resistance molecular marker remained stable.\nConclusions: This MDA was safe and feasible, and, could accelerate elimination of P. falciparum\xa0in addition to EDT and LLINs  when community participation was sufficient.', u'/articles/2-81/v1', [], [u'Shoklo Malaria Research Unit, Mahidol-Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Mae Sot, Thailand', u'Maladies Infectieuses et Vecteurs Ecologie, G\xe9n\xe9tique, Evolution et Contr\xf4le (IRD 224-CNRS 4280 UM1-UM2), Institut de Recherche pour le D\xe9veloppement, Montpellier, France', u'Centre Hospitalier R\xe9gional Universitaire de Montpellier, Montpellier, France', u'Mahidol Oxford Research Unit, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand', u'Department of Molecular Tropical Medicine and Genetics, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand', u'Centre for Genomics and Global Health, Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 7BN, UK', u'Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Cambridge, CB10 1SA, UK', u'Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, 119077, Singapore', u'Singapore Immunology Network (SIgN), Agency for Science & Technology, Singapore, 138632, Singapore', u'Centre for Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Melbourne School of Population and Global Health, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, 3053, Australia', u'Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 7BN, UK']]

CD81 is a prototypical\xa0tetraspanin and contributes to numerous\xa0physiological and pathological\xa0processes, including acting as a critical entry receptor for hepatitis C virus\xa0(HCV). Antibody\xa0engagement of\xa0tetraspanins can induce a variety of effects, including actin cytoskeletal\xa0rearrangements, activation of MAPK-ERK\xa0signaling and cell migration.

PC4 and SF2 interacting protein (PSIP1/LEDGF) is a transcriptional coactivator, possesses a \xa0H3K36me3 reader PWWP domain. Alternatively spliced isoforms of PSIP1 binds to H3K36me3 and suggested to function as adaptor proteins to recruit transcriptional modulators, splicing factors and proteins that promote homology directed repair (HDR), to H3K36me3 chromatin.\nMethods: We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation of H3K36me3 followed by quantitative mass spectrometry to identify proteins associated with H3K36 trimethylated chromatin in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Furthermore, we performed stable isotope labelling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) for a longer isoform of PSIP1 (p75) and MOF/KAT8 in mESCs and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFS).\nResults: Proteomic analysis of H3K36me3 chromatin show association of proteins involved in transcriptional elongation, RNA processing and DNA repair with H3K36me3 chromatin. Furthermore, we show DNA repair proteins like PARP1, gamma H2A.X, XRCC1, DNA ligase 3, SPT16, Topoisomerases and BAZ1B are predominant interacting partners of PSIP1/p75. We validated the association of PSIP1/p75 with gamma H2A.X, an early marker of DNA damage and also demonstrated accumulation of damaged DNA in PSIP1 knockout MEFs.\nConclusions: In contrast to the previously demonstrated role of H3K36me3 and PSIP1/p75 in promoting HDR in mammals, our data supports the wider role of H3K36me3 and PSIP1 in maintaining the genome integrity by recruiting several DNA repair proteins to transcribed gene bodies.', u'/articles/2-83/v1', [], [u'MRC Human Genetics Unit, MRC Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, EH4 2XU, UK', u'School of Biological Sciences, University of Essex, Colchester, CO4 3SQ, UK']]

Making a transgenic mouse involves random integration of exogenous DNA into the host genome that can have the effect of disrupting endogenous gene expression. The J20 mouse model of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is a transgenic overexpresser of human APP with familial AD mutations and has been extensively utilised in preclinical studies and our aim was to determine the genomic location of the J20 transgene insertion.\nMethods: We used a combination of breeding strategy and Targeted Locus Amplification with deep sequencing to identify the insertion site of the J20 transgene array. To assess RNA and protein expression of Zbtb20, we used qRT-PCR and Western Blotting.\nResults: We demonstrate that the J20 transgene construct has inserted within the genetic locus of endogenous mouse gene Zbtb20 on chromosome 16 in an array, disrupting expression of mRNA from this gene in adult hippocampal tissue, while expression of Zbtb20 protein remains unchanged. We note that the endogenous mouse App gene also lies on chromosome 16, although 42 Mb from the Zbtb20 locus.\nConclusions: These data will be useful for future studies utilising this popular model of AD, particularly those investigating gene interactions between the J20 APP transgene and other genes present on Mmu16 in the mouse.', u'/articles/2-84/v1', [], [u'Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Institute of Neurology, University College London, London, WC1N 3BG, UK', u'Gladstone Institute of Neurological Disease and University of California, San Francisco, CA, 4158, USA', u'UK Dementia Research Institute, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, UK']]

[u'A re-assessment of gene-tag classification approaches for describing var gene expression patterns during human Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasite infections', ['George Githinji', 'Peter C.

Through interactions with various host molecules, PfEMP1 mediate IE sequestration in tissues and play a key role in the pathology of severe malaria. PfEMP1 is encoded by a diverse multi-gene family called var. Previous studies have shown that that expression of specific subsets of var genes are associated with low levels of host immunity and severe malaria. However, in most clinical studies to date, full-length var gene sequences were unavailable and various approaches have been used to make comparisons between var gene expression profiles in different parasite isolates using limited information. Several studies have relied on the classification of a 300 \u2013 500 base-pair \u201cDBL\u03b1 tag\u201d region in the DBL\u03b1 domain located at the 5\u2019 end of most var genes.\r\nWe assessed the relationship between various DBL\u03b1 tag classification methods, and sequence features that are only fully assessable through full-length var gene sequences.

Unfortunately, studies of Anopheles swarms are rare in East Africa, the last recorded field observations in Tanzania having been in 1983.\nMethods: Mosquito swarms were surveyed by trained volunteers between August-2016 and June-2017 in Ulanga district, Tanzania. Identified Anopheles swarms were sampled using sweep nets, and collected mosquitoes killed by refrigeration then identified by sex and taxa. Sub-samples were further identified by PCR, and spermatheca of females examined for mating status. Mosquito ages were estimated by observing female ovarian tracheoles and rotation of male genitalia. GPS locations, types of swarm markers, start/end times of swarming, heights above ground, mosquito counts/swarm, and copulation events were recorded.\nResults: A total of 216 Anopheles swarms were identified, characterized and mapped, from which 7,142 Anopheles gambiae s.l and 13 Anopheles funestus were sampled. The An. gambiae s.l were 99.6% males and 0.4% females, while the An. funestus were all males. Of all An. gambiae s.l analyzed by PCR, 86.7% were An. arabiensis, while 13.3% returned non-amplified DNA. Mean height (\xb1SD) of swarms was 2.74\xb10.64m, and median duration was 20 (IQR; 15-25) minutes. Confirmed swarm markers included rice fields (25.5%), burned grounds (17.2%), banana trees (13%), brick piles (8.8%), garbage heaps (7.9%) and ant-hills (7.4%).

An early and leading priority to do this is to strengthen AMR surveillance, particularly in low-income countries where the burden of infectious diseases is highest and where data are most limited.\r\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has developed the Global AMR Surveillance System (GLASS) as one of a number of measures designed to tackle the problem of AMR, and WHO member states have been encouraged to produce National Action Plans for AMR by 2017. However, low-income countries are unlikely to have the resources or capacity to implement all the components in the GLASS manual. To facilitate their efforts, we developed a guideline that is aligned to the GLASS procedures, but written specifically for implementation in low-income countries.

Identifying the emergence of AMR requires strengthening of surveillance for AMR, particularly in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) where the burden of infection is highest and health systems are least able to respond. This work aimed, through a combination of desk-based investigation, discussion with colleagues worldwide, and visits to three contrasting countries (Ethiopia, Malawi and Vietnam), to map and compare existing models and surveillance systems for AMR, to examine what worked and what did not work.\r\nCurrent capacity for AMR surveillance varies in LMICs, but and systems in development are focussed on laboratory surveillance. This approach limits understanding of AMR and the extent to which laboratory results can inform local, national and international public health policy. An integrated model, combining clinical, laboratory and demographic surveillance in sentinel sites is more informative and costs for clinical and demographic surveillance are proportionally much lower.\r\nThe speed and extent to which AMR surveillance can be strengthened depends on the functioning of the health system, and the resources available. Where there is existing laboratory capacity, it may be possible to develop 5-20 sentinel sites with a long term view of establishing comprehensive surveillance; but where health systems are weaker and laboratory infrastructure less developed, available expertise and resources may limit this to 1-2 sentinel sites. Prioritising core functions, such as automated blood cultures, reduces investment at each site. Expertise to support AMR surveillance in LMICs may come from a variety of international, or national, institutions.

Herren'], u'2017/09/26', u'Background: Insect symbionts have the potential to block the transmission of vector-borne diseases by their hosts. The advancement of a symbiont-based transmission blocking strategy for malaria requires the identification and study of Anopheles symbionts.\nMethods: High throughput 16S amplicon sequencing was used to profile the bacteria associated with Anopheles gambiae sensu lato and identify potential symbionts. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with specific primers were subsequently used to monitor symbiont prevalence in field populations, as well as symbiont transmission patterns.\nResults: We report the discovery of the bacterial symbiont, Spiroplasma, in Anopheles gambiae in Kenya. We determine that geographically dispersed Anopheles gambiae populations in Kenya are infected with Spiroplasma at low prevalence levels. Molecular phylogenetics indicates that this Anopheles gambiae associated Spiroplasma is a member of the insolitum clade. We demonstrate that this symbiont is stably maternally transmitted across at least two generations and does not significantly affect the fecundity or egg to adult survival of its host.\nConclusions: In diverse insect species, Spiroplasma has been found to render their host resistant to infection by pathogens.

[u'Feature determination from powered wheelchair user joystick input characteristics for adapting driving assistance', ['Michael Gillham', 'Matthew Pepper', 'Steve Kelly', 'Gareth Howells'], u'2017/09/27', u"Background: Many powered wheelchair users find their medical condition and their ability to drive the wheelchair will change over time. In order to maintain their independent mobility, the powered chair will require adjustment over time to suit the user's needs, thus regular input from healthcare professionals is required. These limited resources can result in the user having to wait weeks for appointments, resulting in the user losing independent mobility, consequently affecting their quality of life and that of their family and carers. In order to provide an adaptive assistive driving system, a range of features need to be identified which are suitable for initial system setup and can automatically provide data for re-calibration over the long term.\nMethods: A questionnaire was designed to collect information from powered wheelchair users with regard to their symptoms and how they changed over time. Another group of volunteer participants were asked to drive a test platform and complete a course which represented manoeuvring in a very confined space as quickly as possible. Two of those participants were also monitored over a longer period in their normal home daily environment. Features, thought to be suitable, were examined using pattern recognition classifiers to determine their suitability for identifying the changing user input over time.\nResults: The results are not designed to provide absolute insight into the individual user behaviour, as no ground truth of their ability has been determined, they do nevertheless demonstrate the utility of the measured features to provide evidence of the users\u2019 changing ability over time whilst driving a powered wheelchair.\nConclusions: Determining the driving features and adjustable elements provides the initial step towards developing an adaptable assistive technology for the user when the ground truths of the individual and their machine have been learned by a smart pattern recognition system.", u'/articles/2-93/v1', [], []]
[u'Extending voluntary health insurance to the informal sector: experiences and expectations of the informal sector in Kenya', ['Edwine W. Barasa', 'Njeri Mwaura', 'Khama Rogo', 'Ledia Andrawes'], u'2017/09/28', u'Background:\xa0Kenya has made a policy decision to use contributory health insurance as one of its key pre-payment health financing mechanisms. The National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) is the main health insurer in Kenya. While the NHIF has hitherto focused its efforts on providing health insurance coverage to individuals in the formal sector, it has recently broadened its focus to include individuals in the informal sector. This paper provides an analysis of the perceptions, and experiences of informal sector individuals in Kenya with regard to enrolment with the NHIF.\r\n\xa0Methods:\xa0We collected data through key informant interviews (39) in two purposefully selected counties. Study participants were drawn from healthcare facilities contracted by the NHIF, and current, former, and prospective informal sector members. We analyzed data using a grounded approach.\r\n\xa0Results:\xa0Participants felt that the NHIF provided inadequate information about the registration and membership processes as well as benefit entitlements. There was variable and inconsistent communication by the NHIF. There was also variance between the official benefit package and the actual benefits received by members. The NHIF registration requirements and processes presented an administrative barrier to obtaining membership. The NHIF premium level and contribution mechanism presents a financial barrier to current and prospective members. Healthcare providers discriminated against NHIF members compared to cash-payers or private insurance holders.\r\n\xa0Conclusions:\xa0The NHIF could improve enrolment and retention of informal sector individuals by; 1) using communication strategies that are effective at reaching the informal sector, 2) improving the affordability of the premium rates, 3) simplifying the enrolment requirements and process, and 4) strengthening accountability mechanisms between itself and healthcare facilities to ensure that enrolled members receive the benefits that they are entitled to, and that client experience at healthcare facilities are satisfactory.', u'/articles/2-94/v1', [], [u'Health Economics Research Unit, KEMRI Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Nairobi, Kenya', u'Health in Africa Initiative, The World Bank Group, Nairobi, Kenya', u'Institute of Global Prosperity, University College London, London, UK']]

Malaria is declining but transmission persists in many rural areas and among forest workers and isolated populations. In these remote communities, conventional health services and education are limited. Mobilising and educating these populations require new approaches as many people are illiterate and do not attend village meetings. This article describes a qualitative study to assess the feasibility of a drama project as a community engagement strategy.\nMethods:\xa0A drama project was conducted in twenty villages in Cambodia with three key messages: to use insecticide-treated bednets and repellents, to get early diagnosis and treatment, and to learn about risks of forest-acquired malaria. Qualitative interviews were conducted with the drama team members, village malaria workers, local health staffs and villagers, to explore the feasibility of using drama to engage the community and the associated challenges.\nResults:\xa029 people were interviewed, which included 18 semi-structured interviews and one focus group discussion. Analysis of the interviews resulted in development of the following seven themes: i) exposure to malaria and engagement activities, ii) readiness and barriers to participation, iii) understanding and learning about malaria using drama, iv) entertainment value and engagement method preferences, v) challenges to community engagement, vi) future participation and vii) sustainability. The event saw a very positive response, with an encouraging average participation rate of 66%. The project faced several challenges including logistic problems, rescheduling due to raining season, and time- and budget-constraints.\nConclusions:\xa0Our evaluation demonstrated that the drama project was feasible in promoting awareness and understanding of malaria prevention and control.

Okumu'], u'2017/10/02', u'Background: Programmatic monitoring of insecticide resistance in disease vectors is mostly done on a large scale, often focusing on differences between districts, regions or countries. However, local heterogeneities in residual malaria transmission imply the need for finer-scale data. This study reports small-scale variations of insecticide susceptibility in Anopheles arabiensis between three neighbouring villages across two seasons in Tanzania, where insecticidal bed nets are extensively used, but malaria transmission persists.\nMethods: WHO insecticide susceptibility assays were conducted on female and male An. arabiensis from three proximal villages, Minepa, Lupiro, and Mavimba, during dry (June-December 2015) and wet (January-May 2016) seasons. Adults emerging from wild-collected larvae were exposed to 0.05% lambda-cyhalothrin, 0.05% deltamethrin, 0.75% permethrin, 4% DDT, 4% dieldrin, 0.1% bendiocarb, 0.1% propoxur, 0.25% pirimiphos-methyl and 5% malathion. A hydrolysis probe assay was used to screen for L1014F (kdr-w) and L1014S (kdr-e) mutations in specimens resistant to DDT or pyrethroids. Synergist assays using piperonly butoxide (PBO) and triphenol phosphate (TPP) were done to assess pyrethroid and bendiocarb resistance phenotypes.\nResults: There were clear seasonal and spatial fluctuations in phenotypic resistance status in An. arabiensis to pyrethroids, DDT and bendiocarb. Pre-exposure to PBO and TPP, resulted in lower knockdown rates and higher mortalities against pyrethroids and bendiocarb, compared to tests without the synergists. Neither L1014F nor L1014S mutations were detected.\nConclusions: This study confirmed the presence of pyrethroid resistance in An. arabiensis and showed small-scale differences in resistance levels between the villages, and between seasons. Substantial, though incomplete, reversal of pyrethroid and bendiocarb resistance following pre-exposure to PBO and TPP, and absence of kdr alleles suggest involvement of P450 monooxygenases and esterases in the resistant phenotypes.

In recent years the importance of a number of different memory B cell subsets that can be formed in response to vaccination or infection has started to become clear. To study memory B cell responses, cells can be cultured ex vivo, allowing for an increase in cell number and activation of these quiescent cells, providing sufficient quantities of each memory subset to enable full investigation of functionality. However, despite numerous papers being published demonstrating bulk memory B cell culture, we could find no literature on optimised conditions for the study of memory B cell subsets, such as IgM+ memory B cells.\nMethods: Following a literature review, we carried out a large screen of memory B cell expansion conditions to identify the combination that induced the highest levels of memory B cell expansion. We subsequently used a novel Design of Experiments approach to finely tune the optimal memory B cell expansion and differentiation conditions for human memory B cell subsets. Finally, we characterised the resultant memory B cell subpopulations by IgH sequencing and flow cytometry.\nResults: The application of specific optimised conditions induce multiple rounds of memory B cell proliferation equally across Ig isotypes, differentiation of memory B cells to antibody secreting cells, and importantly do not alter the Ig genotype of the stimulated cells.\xa0\nConclusions: Overall, our data identify a memory B cell culture system that offers a robust platform for investigating the functionality of rare memory B cell subsets to infection and/or vaccination.', u'/articles/2-97/v1', [], [u'Department of Mucosal Infection and Immunity, Imperial College London, London, W2 1PG, UK', u'The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Cambridge, CB10 1SA, UK', u'Department of Chemical and Process Engineering, University of Surrey, Guildford, GU2 7XH, UK', u'Kymab Ltd., Cambridge, CB22 3AT, UK']]

Along the border with Thailand, Plasmodium falciparum parasites are increasingly showing reduced sensitivity to artemisinin combination therapies. Given that there are no current alternative treatment therapies, one proposed solution to the threat of untreatable P. falciparum malaria is to eliminate the parasite from the region. Several small-scale elimination projects have been piloted along the Myanmar-Thailand border. Following their success, this operational research aimed to scale up the elimination to a broad area of Eastern Kayin State, Myanmar.\nMethods: The project relied on geographic reconnaissance and a geographic information system, community engagement, generalized access to community-based early diagnosis and treatment, near real-time epidemiological surveillance, cross sectional malaria prevalence surveys and targeted mass drug administration in villages with high prevalence of P. falciparum malaria. Molecular markers of drug resistance were also monitored in individuals with symptomatic and asymptomatic infections.\nDiscussion: This project illustrates the establishment of an elimination project and operational research in a remote, rural area encompassing several armed groups, multiple political organizations and a near-absent health care infrastructure. The establishment of the project relied on a strong rapport with the target community, on-the-ground knowledge (through geographic surveys and community engagement), rapid decision making and an approach that was flexible enough to quickly adapt to a complex landscape.

The situation is complicated when conducting genomic research on a disease considered familial and a reason for stigmatisation.\nMethods: We used a Rapid Ethical Appraisal tool to assess local factors that were barriers to getting genuine informed consent prior to conducting a genetic study of podoconiosis (non-filarial elephantiasis) in two Zones of Ethiopia. The tool included in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with patients, healthy community members, field workers, researchers/Institutional Review Board (IRB) members, elders, religious leaders, and podoconiosis administrators who work closely with patients.\nResults: Most patients and healthy community members did not differentiate research from routine clinical diagnosis. Participants felt comfortable when approached in the presence of trusted community members. Field workers and podoconiosis administrators preferred verbal consent, whereas the majority of patients and healthy community members prefer both verbal and written consent. Participants better understood genetic susceptibility concepts when analogies drawn from their day-to-day experience were used. The type of biological sample sought and gender were the two most important factors affecting the recruitment process. Most researchers and IRB members indicated that reporting incidental findings to participants is not a priority in an Ethiopian context.\nConclusions: Understanding the concerns of local people in areas where research is to be conducted facilitates the design of contextualized consent processes appropriate for all parties and will ultimately result in getting genuine consent.', u'/articles/2-99/v1', [], [u'Unit of Health Biotechnology, Institute of Biotechnology, College of Natural and Computational Sciences, Addis Ababa University, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia', u'Armauer Hansen Research Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia', u'Debre Markos University, Debre Markos, Ethiopia', u'The Wellcome Trust Brighton and Sussex Centre for Global Health Research, Brighton and Sussex Medical School, Brighton, BN1 9PX, UK', u'Centre for Research on Genomics and Global Health, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, 20892, USA', u'Medical Faculty, Addis Ababa University, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia']]

This represents a significant burden on in-patient services. The targeted use of oxygen and simple, non-invasive methods of respiratory support may be a highly cost-effective means of improving outcome, but the optimal oxygen saturation threshold that results in benefit and the best strategy for delivery are yet to be tested in adequately powered randomised controlled trials. There is, however, an accumulating literature about the harms of oxygen therapy across a range of acute and emergency situations that have stimulated a number of trials investigating permissive hypoxia.\nMethods: In 4200 African children, aged 2 months to 12 years, presenting to 5 hospitals in East Africa with respiratory distress and hypoxia (oxygen saturation < 92%), the COAST trial will simultaneously evaluate two related interventions (targeted use of oxygen with respect to the optimal oxygen saturation threshold for treatment and mode of delivery) to reduce shorter-term mortality at 48-hours (primary endpoint), and longer-term morbidity and mortality to 28 days in a fractional factorial design, that compares:\r\n\r\n\nLiberal oxygenation (recommended care) compared with a strategy that permits hypoxia to SpO2 > or = 80% (permissive hypoxia); and\nHigh flow using AIrVO2TM compared with low flow delivery (routine care).\n\nDiscussion: The overarching objective is to address the key research gaps in the therapeutic use of oxygen in resource-limited setting in order to provide a better evidence base for future management guidelines.

[u'Variations in household microclimate affect outdoor-biting behaviour of malaria vectors', ['Halfan Said Ngowo', 'Emmanuel Wilson Kaindoa', 'Jason Matthiopoulos', 'Heather M. Ferguson', 'Fredros Oketch Okumu'], u'2017/10/24', u'Background: Mosquito behaviours including the degree to which they bite inside houses or outside is a crucial determinant of human exposure to malaria. Whilst seasonality in mosquito vector abundance is well documented, much less is known about the impact of climate on mosquito behaviour. We investigated how variations in household microclimate affect outdoor-biting by malaria vectors, Anopheles arabiensis and Anopheles funestus.\nMethods: Mosquitoes were sampled indoors and outdoors weekly using human landing catches at eight households in four villages in south-eastern Tanzania, resulting in 616 trap-nights over 12 months. Daily temperature, relative humidity and rainfall were recorded. Generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) were used to test associations between mosquito abundance and the microclimatic conditions. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) were used to investigate the influence of microclimatic conditions on the tendency of vectors to bite outdoors (proportion of outdoor biting).\nResults:\xa0An. arabiensis abundance peaked during high rainfall months (February-May), whilst An. funestus density remained stable into the dry season (May-August). Across the range of observed household temperatures, a rise of 1\xbaC marginally increased nightly An. arabiensis abundance (~11%), but more prominently increased An. funestus abundance (~66%). The abundance of An. arabiensis and An. funestus showed strong positive associations with time-lagged rainfall (2-3 and 3-4 weeks before sampling). The degree of outdoor biting in An. arabiensis was significantly associated with the relative temperature difference between indoor and outdoor environments, with exophily increasing as temperature inside houses became relatively warmer. The exophily of An. funestus did not vary with temperature differences. \xa0\nConclusions: This study demonstrates that malaria vector An. arabiensis shifts the location of its biting from indoors to outdoors in association with relative differences in microclimatic conditions. These environmental impacts could give rise to seasonal variation in mosquito biting behaviour and degree of protection provided by indoor-based vector control strategies.', u'/articles/2-102/v1', [], [u'Department of Environmental Health and Ecological Sciences, Ifakara Health Institute, Ifakara, Tanzania', u'Institute of Biodiversity, Animal Health and Comparative Medicine, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK', u'School of Public Health, University of the Witwatersrand, Parktown, South Africa']]

Walmsley'], u'2017/10/26', u'Background: Pseudomonas species are adapted to evade innate immune responses and can persist at sites of relative tissue hypoxia, including the mucus-plugged airways of patients with cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis.\xa0 The ability of these bacteria to directly sense and respond to changes in local oxygen availability is in part consequent upon expression of the 2-oxoglutarate oxygenase, Pseudomonas prolyl hydroxylase (PPHD), which acts on elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu), and is homologous with the human hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) prolyl hydroxylases. We report that PPHD expression regulates the neutrophil response to acute pseudomonal infection.\nMethods: In vitro co-culture experiments were performed with human neutrophils and PPHD-deficient and wild-type bacteria and supernatants, with viable neutrophil counts determined by flow cytometry. In vivo consequences of infection with PPHD deficient P. aeruginosa were determined in an acute pneumonia mouse model following intra-tracheal challenge.\nResults: Supernatants of PPHD-deficient bacterial cultures contained higher concentrations of the phenazine exotoxin pyocyanin and induced greater acceleration of neutrophil apoptosis than wild-type PAO1 supernatants in vitro.\xa0 In vivo infection with PPHD mutants compared to wild-type PAO1 controls resulted in increased levels of neutrophil apoptosis and impaired control of infection, with higher numbers of P. aeruginosa recovered from the lungs of mice infected with the PPHD-deficient strain.\xa0 This resulted in an overall increase in mortality in mice infected with the PPHD-deficient strain.\nConclusions: Our data show that Pseudomonas expression of its prolyl hydroxylase influences the outcome of host-pathogen interactions in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating the importance of considering how both host and pathogen adaptations to hypoxia together define outcomes of infection.

However, the impact of HIV infection on immune cell populations in the lung is not well defined. We sought to comprehensively characterise the impact of HIV infection on immune cell populations in the lung.\nMethods: Twenty HIV-uninfected controls and 17 HIV-1 infected ART-na\xefve adults were recruited from Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, Malawi. Immunophenotyping of lymphocyte and myeloid cell populations was done on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and peripheral blood cells.\nResults: We found that the numbers of CD8+ T cells, B cells and gamma delta T cells were higher in BAL fluid of HIV-infected adults compared to HIV-uninfected controls (all p<0.05). In contrast, there was no difference in the numbers of alveolar CD4+ T cells in HIV-infected adults compared to HIV-uninfected controls (p=0.7065). Intermediate monocytes were the predominant monocyte subset in BAL fluid (HIV-, 63%; HIV+ 81%), while the numbers of classical monocytes was lower in HIV-infected individuals compared to HIV-uninfected adults (p=0.0006). The proportions of alveolar macrophages and myeloid dendritic cells was lower in HIV-infected adults compared to HIV-uninfected controls (all p<0.05).\nConclusions: Chronic HIV infection is associated with broad alteration of immune cell populations in the lung, but does not lead to massive depletion of alveolar CD4+ T cells.

Given recent evidence for genetic and pathophysiological overlap between monogenic and polygenic forms of SVD, evaluation of TREX1 in small vessel stroke is warranted.\nMethods: We sequenced the TREX1 gene in an exploratory cohort of patients with lacunar stroke (Edinburgh Stroke Study, n=290 lacunar stroke cases). We subsequently performed a fully blinded case-control study of early onset MRI-confirmed small vessel stroke within the UK Young Lacunar Stroke Resource (990 cases, 939 controls).\nResults: No patients with canonical disease-causing mutations of TREX1 were identified in cases or controls. Analysis of an exploratory cohort identified a potential association between rare variants of TREX1 and patients with lacunar stroke. However, subsequent controlled and blinded evaluation of TREX1 in a larger and MRI-confirmed patient cohort, the UK Young Lacunar Stroke Resource, identified heterozygous rare variants in 2.1% of cases and 2.3% of controls. No association was observed with stroke risk (odds ratio = 0.90; 95% confidence interval, 0.49-1.65 p=0.74). Similarly no association was seen with rare TREX1 variants with predicted deleterious effects on enzyme function (odds ratio = 1.05; 95% confidence interval, 0.43-2.61 p=0.91).\nConclusions: No patients with early-onset lacunar stroke had genetic evidence of a TREX1-associated monogenic microangiopathy. These results show no evidence of association between rare variants of TREX1 and early onset lacunar stroke. This includes rare variants that significantly affect protein and enzyme function.

Collecting their larvae in natural breeding sites, rearing and maintaining them in normal laboratory conditions have been a difficult task. Forced-egg laying technique has been a very good tool to generate eggs from adult mosquitoes collected from the wild but rearing these eggs to obtain satisfying portion as adults has always been the problem. In this study, we optimized the development of mosquito species larvae under standard laboratory conditions for desired production of adult mosquitoes that can be useful for insecticide susceptibility tests.\nMethods:\xa0 A forced-egg laying technique was used to obtain eggs from gravid female Anopheles funestus collected from Kpome locality in Benin. Eggs were reared in three different water samples (water from the borehole,and two mineral water namely FIFA and Possot\xf4m\xe8) and larvae were fed with TetraMin baby fish food. The physico-chemical parameters of the waters were investigated prior to use for egg incubation.\nResults:In contrast to mineral water that had no contamination, the borehole water source was contaminated with lead (2.5mg/L) and nitrate (118.8mg/L). Egg hatching rates ranged as 91.9 \xb1 4.4%, 89.1 \xb1 2.5% and 87.9 \xb1 2.6% in FIFA, Possot\xf4m\xe8 and borehole water respectively.

[u'Perturbation of PALB2 function by the T413S mutation found in small cell lung cancer', ['Jean-Yves Bleuyard', 'Rosie M. Butler', 'Fumiko Esashi'], u'2017/11/14', u'Background: Germline mutations in the PALB2 gene are associated with the genetic disorder Fanconi anaemia and increased predisposition to cancer. Disease-associated variants are mainly protein-truncating mutations, whereas a few missense substitutions are reported to perturb its interaction with breast cancer susceptibility proteins BRCA1 and BRCA2, which play essential roles in homology-directed repair (HDR). More recently, PALB2 was shown to associate with active genes independently of BRCA1, and through this mechanism, safeguards these regions from DNA replicative stresses. However, it is unknown whether PALB2 tumour suppressor function requires its chromatin association.\nMethods: Mining the public database of cancer mutations, we identified four potentially deleterious cancer-associated missense mutations within the PALB2 chromatin association motif (ChAM). To assess the impact of these mutations on PALB2 function, we generated cell lines expressing PALB2 variants harbouring corresponding ChAM mutations, and evaluated PALB2 chromatin association properties and the cellular resistance to camptothecin (CPT). Additionally, we examined the accumulation of \u03b3H2A.X and the RAD51 recombinase as readouts of DNA damage signalling and HDR, respectively.\nResults: We demonstrate that a small-cell lung cancer (SCLC)-associated T413S mutation in PALB2 impairs its chromatin association and confers reduced resistance to CPT, the only FDA-approved drug for relapsed SCLC. Unexpectedly, we found a less efficient \u03b3H2A.X nuclear foci formation in PALB2 T413S expressing cells, whereas a near-normal level of RAD51 nuclear foci was visible.\nConclusions: These findings support the importance of PALB2 chromatin association in the suppression of tumours, including SCLC, an unusually aggressive type of cancer with poor prognosis. PALB2 T413S has little impact on RAD51 recruitment, likely due to its intact interaction with BRCA1 and BRCA2. However, this mutant shows inefficient DNA stress signalling.

[u'Knockdown of Laminin gamma-3 (Lamc3) impairs motoneuron guidance in the zebrafish embryo', ['Alexander M. J. Eve', 'James C.

Transgenic imaging, immunofluorescence, and in situ hybridisation reveal that Lamc3 loss-of-function affects the development of muscle pioneers, endothelial cells, and motoneurons.\nResults:\xa0Lamc3 is enriched in endothelial cells during zebrafish development, but it is also expressed by other tissues. Depletion of Lamc3 by use of antisense morpholino oligonucleotides perturbs formation of the parachordal chain and subsequently the thoracic duct, but Lamc3 is not required for sprouting of the cardinal vein. F0 embryos in which lamc3 expression is perturbed by a CRISPR/Cas9 approach also fail to form a parachordal chain, but we were unable to establish a stable lamc3 null line. Lamc3 is dispensable for muscle pioneer specification and for the expression of netrin-1a in these cells. Lamc3 knockdown causes netrin-1a up-regulation in the neural tube and there is increased Netrin-1 protein throughout the trunk of the embryo. Axonal guidance of rostral primary motoneurons is defective in Lamc3 knockdown embryos.\nConclusions: We suggest that knockdown of Lamc3 perturbs migration of rostral primary motoneurons at the level of the horizontal myoseptum, indicating that laminin \u03b33 plays a role in motoneuron guidance.', u'/articles/2-111/v1', [], []]

Okumu'], u'2017/11/22', u'Background: Despite high coverage of indoor interventions like insecticide-treated nets, mosquito-borne infections persist, partly because of outdoor-biting, early-biting and insecticide-resistant vectors. Push-pull systems, where mosquitoes are repelled from humans and attracted to nearby lethal targets, may constitute effective complementary interventions.\nMethods: A partially randomized cross-over design was used to test efficacy of push-pull in four experimental huts and four local houses, in an area with high pyrethroid resistance in Tanzania. The push-pull system consisted of 1.1% or 2.2% w/v transfluthrin repellent dispensers and an outdoor lure-and-kill device (odour-baited mosquito landing box). Matching controls were set up without push-pull. Adult male volunteers collected mosquitoes attempting to bite them outdoors, but collections were also done indoors using exit traps in experimental huts and by volunteers in the local houses. The collections were done hourly (1830hrs-0730hrs) and mosquito catches compared between push-pull and controls. An. gambiae s.l. and An. funestus s.l. were assessed by PCR to identify sibling species, and ELISA to detect Plasmodium falciparum and blood meal sources.\nResults: Push-pull in experimental huts reduced outdoor-biting for An. arabiensis and Mansonia species by 30% and 41.5% respectively. However, the reductions were marginal and insignificant for An. funestus (12.2%; p>0.05) and Culex (5%; p>0.05). Highest protection against all species occurred before 2200hrs. There was no significant difference in number of mosquitoes inside exit traps in huts with or without push-pull. In local households, push-pull significantly reduced indoor and outdoor-biting of An. arabiensis by 48% and 25% respectively, but had no effect on other species.\nConclusion: This push-pull system offered modest protection against outdoor-biting An. arabiensis, without increasing indoor mosquito densities. Additional experimentation is required to assess how transfluthrin-based products affect mosquito blood-feeding and mortality in push-pull contexts.

Radiographer flagging missed 16/21 serious final diagnoses (i.e., false negatives), while systematic radiologist review generated large numbers of non-serious final diagnoses (158/179) (i.e., false positives).
