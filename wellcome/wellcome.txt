[u'Neural correlates of fears of abandonment and rejection in borderline personality disorder', ['Liana Romaniuk', 'Merrick Pope', 'Katie Nicol', 'Douglas Steele', 'Jeremy Hall'], u'2016/12/29', u'Background: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a prevalent and disabling psychiatric condition commonly associated with early life adversity. Social difficulties are a prominent symptom of BPD, particularly a fear of abandonment and rejection. There has recently been a growing interest in the neural basis of these social symptoms and their relationship to early experience.\xa0Methods: In the current study, we examined social brain function and learning in BPD using functional MRI. Participants with BPD (n=20) and healthy controls (n=16) completed a computerized parametric social exclusion task (the \u201cCyberball\u201d task). Brain activation was compared between groups and related to social symptom status and experiences of childhood trauma. Additional analyses were conducted using a reinforcement learning model treating social inclusion as a rewarding event.\xa0Results: Participants with BPD demonstrated a group effect of decreased right temporoparietal junction (TPJ) activation (p < 0.013, FWE-corrected). Increased fear of abandonment in BPD was associated with reduced inclusion-related activation of the inferior frontal gyrus (p = 0.003, FWE-corrected). Across all participants, TPJ inclusion-related activation was modified by prior experience of childhood physical neglect (p < 0.001, FWE-corrected). Reinforcement learning modelling revealed decreased midbrain responses to social inclusion in BPD participants (p = 0.028, FWE-corrected within midbrain mask), with decreased anticipatory midbrain activation in anticipation of social inclusion specifically associated with fears of abandonment (p = 0.019, FWE-corrected within a midbrain mask).\xa0Conclusions: The findings demonstrate alterations in social brain function and social reinforcement learning in BPD, which are influenced by both early life experience and symptom status.', u'/articles/1-33/v1', [], [u'Division of Psychiatry, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK', u'Medical Research Institute, University of Dundee, Dundee, UK', u'Neuroscience and Mental Health Research Institute, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK', u'MRC Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK']]

The objective of this study was to identify protein biomarkers of brain atrophy in SPMS.\r\n\xa0\nMethods\r\nWe used surface-enhanced laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry to carry out an unbiased search for serum proteins whose concentration correlated with the rate of brain atrophy, measured by serial MRI scans over a 2-year period in a well-characterized cohort of 140 patients with SPMS. \xa0Protein species were identified by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry.\r\n\xa0\nResults\r\nThere was a significant (p<0.004) correlation between the rate of brain atrophy and a rise in the concentration of proteins at 15.1 kDa and 15.9 kDa in the serum.\xa0 Tandem mass spectrometry identified these proteins as alpha-haemoglobin and beta-haemoglobin, respectively.\xa0 The abnormal concentration of free serum haemoglobin was confirmed by ELISA (p<0.001).\xa0 The serum lactate dehydrogenase activity was also highly significantly raised (p<10-12) in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis.\xa0\r\n\xa0\nConclusions\r\nThe results are consistent with the following hypothesis. In progressive multiple sclerosis, low-grade chronic intravascular haemolysis releases haemoglobin into the serum; the haemoglobin is subsequently translocated into the central nervous system (CNS) across the damaged blood-brain barrier.\xa0 In the CNS, the haemoglobin and its breakdown products, including haem and iron, contribute to the neurodegeneration and consequent brain atrophy seen in progressive disease. We postulate that haemoglobin is a source of the iron whose deposition along blood vessels in multiple sclerosis plaques is associated with neurodegeneration.\xa0 If so, then chelators of haemoglobin, rather than chelators of free serum iron, may be effective in preventing this neurodegeneration.', u'/articles/1-10/v2', [], [u'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Imperial College London, London, UK', u'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK', u'Division of Brain Sciences, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK', u'National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and Queen Square Multiple Sclerosis Centre, Department of Neuroinflammation, University College London, London, UK', u'Present address: Department of Mathematics, Brunel University, London, UK']]

This presents a problem with the gestational limit of miscarriage, and hence reporting of stillbirth, preterm birth and neonatal death. The objective of this study is to provide a synopsis of the outcome of a population cohort of pregnancies on the Thailand-Myanmar border between 24 to <28 weeks\u2019 gestation.\xa0Methods.\xa0Records from the Shoklo Malaria Research Unit Antenatal Clinics were reviewed for pregnancy outcomes in the gestational window of 24 to <28 weeks, and each record, including ultrasounds reports, were reviewed to clarify the pregnancy outcome. Pregnancies where there was evidence of fetal demise prior to 24 weeks were classified as miscarriage; those viable at 24 weeks\u2019 gestation and born before 28 weeks were coded as births, and further subdivided into live- and stillbirth.\xa0Results.\xa0Between 1995 and 2015, in a cohort of 49,931 women, 0.6% (318) of outcomes occurred from 24 to <28 weeks\u2019 gestation, and 35.8% (114) were miscarriages, with confirmatory ultrasound of fetal demise in 45.4% (49/108).

The envelope glycoprotein of several retroviruses is thought to possess potent immunosuppressive activity, mapped to a 17-amino acid residue conserved domain. Synthetic peptides corresponding to this immunosuppressive domain can inhibit lymphocyte activation, whereas mutation of key domain residues can increase the lymphocyte response to linked antigenic epitopes. Using three T cell receptors (TCRs) of defined specificity, we examine the effect of the immunosuppressive domain on the T cell response to their respective antigenic peptides. We find that fusion of a T cell epitope to the immunosuppressive domain can greatly modulate its potency. However, the effects heavily depend on the particular combination of TCR and peptide-major histocompatibility complex class II (pMHC II), and are mimicked by sequence-scrambled peptides of similar length, suggesting they operate at the level of TCR-pMHC interaction. These results offer an alternative explanation for the immunogenicity of T cell epitopes comprising the putative immunosuppressive domain, which is more consistent with an effect on peptide antigenicity than true immunosuppressive activity.', u'/articles/1-22/v1', [], [u'The Francis Crick Institute, London, UK', u'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK']]

Identifying whole exon deletions or duplications (termed exon copy number variants, \u2018exon CNVs\u2019) in exon-targeted NGS panels has proved challenging, particularly for single exon CNVs.\xa0\nMethods: We developed a tool for the Detection of Exon Copy Number variants (DECoN), which is optimised for analysis of exon-targeted NGS panels in the clinical setting. We evaluated DECoN performance using 96 samples with independently validated exon CNV data. We performed simulations to evaluate DECoN detection performance of single exon CNVs and to evaluate performance using different coverage levels and sample numbers. Finally, we implemented DECoN in a clinical laboratory that tests BRCA1 and BRCA2 with the TruSight Cancer Panel (TSCP). We used DECoN to analyse 1,919 samples, validating exon CNV detections by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA).\xa0\nResults: In the evaluation set, DECoN achieved 100% sensitivity and 99% specificity for BRCA exon CNVs, including identification of 8 single exon CNVs. DECoN also identified 14/15 exon CNVs in 8 other genes. Simulations of all possible BRCA single exon CNVs gave a mean sensitivity of 98% for deletions and 95% for duplications. DECoN performance remained excellent with different levels of coverage and sample numbers; sensitivity and specificity was >98% with the typical NGS run parameters. In the clinical pipeline, DECoN automatically analyses pools of 48 samples at a time, taking 24 minutes per pool, on average.

The published method involves manual design of the single guide RNA (sgRNA), and digestion of a large plasmid with a problematic restriction enzyme to clone the sgRNA. To increase the efficiency of this approach, we have established and optimized a PCR-based system to clone the sgRNA without restriction enzymes into a plasmid with a dominant natMX6 (nourseothricin) selection marker. We also provide a web-tool, CRISPR4P, to support the design of the sgRNAs and the primers required for the entire process of seamless DNA deletion. Moreover, we report the preparation of G1-synchronized and cryopreserved S. pombe cells, which greatly increases the efficiency and speed for transformations, and may also facilitate standard gene manipulations.

The ability to prevent phagosome-lysosome fusion is a key mechanism by which intracellular mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, achieve long-term persistence within host cells. The mechanisms underpinning this key intracellular pro-survival strategy remain incompletely understood. Host macrophages infected with persistent mycobacteria share phenotypic similarities with cells taken from patients suffering from Niemann-Pick Disease Type C (NPC), a rare lysosomal storage disease in which endocytic trafficking defects and lipid accumulation within the lysosome lead to cell dysfunction and cell death. We investigated whether these shared phenotypes reflected an underlying mechanistic connection between mycobacterial intracellular persistence and the host cell pathway dysfunctional in NPC.\xa0Methods.\xa0The induction of NPC phenotypes in macrophages from wild-type mice or obtained from healthy human donors was assessed via infection with mycobacteria and subsequent measurement of lipid levels and intracellular calcium homeostasis. The effect of NPC therapeutics on intracellular mycobacterial load was also assessed.\xa0Results.\xa0Macrophages infected with persistent intracellular mycobacteria phenocopied NPC cells, exhibiting accumulation of multiple lipid types, reduced lysosomal Ca2+ levels, and defects in intracellular trafficking. These NPC phenotypes could also be induced using only lipids/glycomycolates from the mycobacterial cell wall. These data suggest that persistent intracellular mycobacteria inhibit the NPC pathway, likely via inhibition of the NPC1 protein, and subsequently induce altered acidic store Ca2+ homeostasis. Reduced lysosomal calcium levels may provide a mechanistic explanation for the reduced levels of phagosome-lysosome fusion in mycobacterial infection. Treatments capable of correcting defects in NPC mutant cells via modulation of host cell calcium were of benefit in promoting clearance of mycobacteria from infected host cells.\xa0Conclusion.\xa0These findings provide a novel mechanistic explanation for mycobacterial intracellular persistence, and suggest that targeting interactions between the mycobacteria and host cell pathways may provide a novel avenue for development of anti-TB therapies.', u'/articles/1-18/v1', [], [u'Department of Pharmacology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK', u'School of Biosciences, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK', u'School of Medicine, Ko\xe7 University, Istanbul, Turkey', u"Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA", u'Public Health England, Salisbury, UK', u'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, USA', u'Diabetic Cardiovascular Disease Center, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, USA', u'School of Biosciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK', u'Faculty of Science Engineering and Computing, Kingston University, Kingston upon Thames, UK']]

It is a potent cytokine, with potential antiviral impact, and has been shown to play a role in modulating functions of diverse cell types, including Th1, Th2, and NK and B cells, demonstrating both pro- and anti-inflammatory roles.\xa0 In hepatocytes, it is capable of inducing signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1, STAT3 and interferon-stimulated genes.\nMethods: To address its role in viral hepatitis, the antiviral activity of IL-27 against hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) was tested in vitro using cell-culture-derived infectious HCV (HCVcc) cell culture system and the HepaRG HBV cell culture model. To further investigate the impact of IL-27 on hepatocytes, Huh7.5 cells were treated with IL-27 to analyse the differentially expressed genes by microarray analysis. Furthermore, by quantitative PCR, we analyzed the up-regulation of chemokine (CXCL)-10 in response to IL-27.\nResults: In both HCV and HBV infection models, we observed only a modest direct antiviral effect. Microarray analysis showed that the up-regulated genes mostly belonged to antigen presentation and DNA replication pathways, and involved strong up-regulation of CXCL-10, a gene associated with liver inflammation. Overall, gene set enrichment analysis showed a striking correlation of these genes with those up-regulated in response to related cytokines in diverse cell populations.\nConclusion: Our data indicate that IL-27 can have a significant pro-inflammatory impact in vitro, although the direct antiviral effect is modest.

Studies to date have identified a number of factors that might influence the brain organisation of language in bilinguals. These include proficiency, age of acquisition and exposure to the second language. The question as to whether the cerebral lateralisation of first and second languages are the same or different is as yet unresolved. Methods. We used functional transcranial Doppler sonography (FTCD) to measure cerebral lateralisation in the first and second languages in 26 high proficiency bilinguals with German or French as their first language (L1) and English as their second language (L2). FTCD was used to measure task-dependent blood flow velocity changes in the left and right middle cerebral arteries during word generation cued by single letters. Language history measures and handedness were assessed through self-report questionnaires. Results. The majority of participants were significantly left lateralised for both L1 and L2, with no significant difference in the size of asymmetry indices between L1 and L2.

Common examples are the use of chromatin immunoprecipitation for the analysis of chromatin modifications or factor binding, enzymatic digestions for chromatin structure assays, and RNA sequencing to assess gene expression changes after biological perturbations. To investigate the pattern and abundance of coverage signals across regions of interest, data are often visualized as profile plots of average signal or stacked rows of signal in the form of heatmaps. We found that available plotting software was either slow and laborious or difficult to use by investigators with little computational training, which inhibited wide data exploration. To address this need, we developed SeqPlots, a user-friendly exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization software for genomics. After choosing groups of signal and feature files and defining plotting parameters, users can generate profile plots of average signal or heatmaps clustered using different algorithms in a matter of seconds through the graphical user interface (GUI) controls. SeqPlots accepts all major genomic file formats as input and can also generate and plot user defined motif densities. Profile plots and heatmaps are highly configurable and batch operations can be used to generate a large number of plots at once. SeqPlots is available as a GUI application for Mac or Windows and Linux, or as an R/Bioconductor package. It can also be deployed on a server for remote and collaborative usage.

In particular, the ability to couple disease-causing mutations with human neuronal differentiation systems would be beneficial. Gene targeting is a well-known approach for dissecting gene function, but low rates of homologous recombination in somatic cells (including neuronal cells) have traditionally impeded the development of robust cellular models of neurological disorders. Recently, however, CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technologies have expanded the number of systems within which gene targeting is possible. Here we adopt as a model system LUHMES cells, a commercially available diploid human female mesencephalic cell line that differentiates into homogeneous mature neurons in 1-2 weeks. We describe optimised methods for transfection and selection of neuronal progenitor cells carrying targeted genomic alterations using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. By targeting the endogenous X-linked MECP2 locus, we introduced four independent missense mutations that cause the autism spectrum disorder Rett syndrome and observed the desired genetic structure in 3-26% of selected clones, including gene targeting of the inactive X chromosome. Similar efficiencies were achieved by introducing neurodevelopmental disorder-causing mutations at the autosomal EEF1A2 locus on chromosome 20. Our results indicate that efficiency of genetic \u201cknock-in\u201d is determined by the location of the mutation within the donor DNA molecule.

Careful calibration of this system will allow users to simultaneously assess sleep status in mice.

Characterising the changes in mouse embryos that result from ablation of lethal genes is a necessary first step towards uncovering their role in normal embryonic development and establishing any correlates amongst human congenital abnormalities.\nMethods: Here we present results gathered to date in the Deciphering the Mechanisms of Developmental Disorders (DMDD) programme, cataloguing the morphological defects identified from comprehensive imaging of 220 homozygous mutant embryos from 42 lethal and subviable lines, analysed at E14.5.\nResults: Virtually all embryos show multiple abnormal phenotypes and amongst the 42 lines these affect most organ systems. Within each mutant line, the phenotypes of individual embryos form distinct but overlapping sets. Subcutaneous edema, malformations of the heart or great vessels, abnormalities in forebrain morphology and the musculature of the eyes are all prevalent phenotypes, as is loss or abnormal size of the hypoglossal nerve.\nConclusions: Overall, the most striking finding is that no matter how profound the malformation, each phenotype shows highly variable penetrance within a mutant line.

[u'Making the most of RNA-seq: Pre-processing sequencing data with Opossum for reliable SNP variant detection', ['Laura Oikkonen', 'Stefano Lise'], u'2017/01/17', u'Identifying variants from RNA-seq (transcriptome sequencing) data is a cost-effective and versatile alternative to whole-genome sequencing. However, current variant callers do not generally behave well with RNA-seq data due to reads encompassing intronic regions. We have developed a software programme called Opossum to address this problem. Opossum pre-processes RNA-seq reads prior to variant calling, and although it has been designed to work specifically with Platypus, it can be used equally well with other variant callers such as GATK HaplotypeCaller. In this work, we show that using Opossum in conjunction with either Platypus or GATK HaplotypeCaller maintains precision and improves the sensitivity for SNP detection compared to the GATK Best Practices pipeline. In addition, using it in combination with Platypus offers a substantial reduction in run times compared to the GATK pipeline so it is ideal when there are only limited time or computational resources available.', u'/articles/2-6/v1', [], [u'Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK', u'Centre for Evolution and Cancer, The Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, UK']]
[u"To 'take their place among the productive members of society': Vocational rehabilitation of WWI wounded at Erskine", ['Jennifer Novotny'], u'2017/01/17', u'In 1916, the foundation of the Princess Louise Scottish Hospital for Limbless Sailors and Soldiers (still in existence today as Erskine), on the banks of the River Clyde in Scotland, was a direct response to the need for specialised medical facilities to deal with the unprecedented number of injured service personnel returning from the Great War. At the hospital, the West of Scotland medical and industrial communities came together to mend broken bodies with prosthetic technology, as well as physical and mental rehabilitation to prepare the limbless to re-enter the job market. This paper explores the establishment of manual therapy workshops at Erskine and how such programmes of vocational rehabilitation were culturally informed by the concerns and anxieties of both the military and civilian populations of the First World War-era.', u'/articles/2-5/v1', [], [u'University of Glasgow, Glasgow, Scotland, UK']]
[u'Tuberculosis control in postcolonial South India and beyond: Fractured sovereignties in international health, 1948-1960', ['Vivek Neelakantan'], u'2017/01/13', u'Between 1948 and 1960, South India (Madras State) and Southeast Asia emerged as global centres for tuberculosis control. This article attempts to situate tuberculosis control of these two regions within the broader context of international health. It investigates the unique ways in which tuberculosis control in Madras state reflected the inner tensions between the notional magic bullet approach, which focuses on specific cures to root out the cause of the disease, and a more holistic approach that relates disease prevention to overall well-being of the population. The implementation of tuberculosis control across South India and Southeast Asia shed light on the nature of the post-colonial state sovereignty in public health. Across India, as in Southeast Asia, the state sovereignty appertaining to the implementation of health policy was fractured, as evident in the opposition to the Bacillus Calmette\u2013Gu\xe9rin (BCG) vaccination. Based on a wide range of archival materials, this article examines tuberculosis control in South India and Southeast Asia between 1948 and 1960. It situates tuberculosis control within the context of nationalist discourse and preventive medicine. In doing so, it adds not only to the historiography of tuberculosis in non-Western contexts, which has hitherto focused on India, Sri Lanka, Africa, or the Caribbean, but also to the relatively new field of Southeast Asian medical history.', u'/articles/2-4/v1', [], [u'Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India']]
[u"Envy's pathology: Historical contexts", ['Lina Minou'], u'2017/01/09', u'This article is concerned with the physicality of envy in early modern- and eighteenth-century health contexts. The discussion brings together descriptions of the effects of envy on the body of the envier, mainly from works of physiology and health preservation, but also from literary and spiritual writings. These depictions of envy are studied beyond their symbolism and with a view to establish whether they are meaningful according to the medical paradigms of the time in which they occur. The discussion begins by acknowledging the status of envy as a \u2018disease\u2019 and looks to the specific ways in which the discourse of envy conveys this sense. I find that in the early modern discourse envy is always pathological, that is, it is experienced as disease and signifies disease in general and several diseases in particular. Moreover, envy is uniquely placed to convey pathology on account of its being connected to inherently pathogenic elements of the humoural theory. Specifically, envy is physiologically connected to melancholy, and the way it is presented comes close to attributes assigned to black bile. In addition, envy realizes pathology, the occurrence of disease in the body, by impairing the vital process of digestion and thus depriving the person from proper nourishment and sustenance. This article concludes by looking at envy within an eighteenth-century context. It finds that by the end of the century envy undergoes a significant shift away from its status as disease and considers the reasons for this change.', u'/articles/2-3/v1', [], [u'Independent Researcher, Nottingham, UK']]
[u'Cdc14 phosphatase directs centrosome re-duplication at the meiosis I to meiosis II transition in budding yeast', ['Colette Fox', 'Juan Zou', 'Juri Rappsilber', 'Adele L. Marston'], u'2017/01/05', u'Background\r\nGametes are generated through a specialized cell division called meiosis, in which ploidy is reduced by half because two consecutive rounds of chromosome segregation, meiosis I and meiosis II, occur without intervening DNA replication. This contrasts with the mitotic cell cycle where DNA replication and chromosome segregation alternate to maintain the same ploidy. At the end of mitosis, CDKs are inactivated. This low CDK state in late mitosis/G1 allows for critical preparatory events for DNA replication and centrosome/spindle pole body (SPB) duplication. However, their execution is inhibited until S phase, where further preparatory events are also prevented. This \u201clicensing\u201d ensures that both the chromosomes and the centrosomes/SPBs replicate exactly once per cell cycle, thereby maintaining constant ploidy. Crucially, between meiosis I and meiosis II, centrosomes/SPBs must be re-licensed, but DNA re-replication must be avoided. In budding yeast, the Cdc14 protein phosphatase triggers CDK down regulation to promote exit from mitosis. Cdc14 also regulates the meiosis I to meiosis II transition, though its mode of action has remained unclear.\nMethods\r\nFluorescence and electron microscopy was combined with proteomics to probe SPB duplication in cells with inactive or hyperactive Cdc14.\nResults\r\nWe demonstrate that Cdc14 ensures two successive nuclear divisions by re-licensing SPBs at the meiosis I to meiosis II transition. We show that Cdc14 is asymmetrically enriched on a single SPB during anaphase I and provide evidence that this enrichment promotes SPB re-duplication. Cells with impaired Cdc14 activity fail to promote extension of the SPB half-bridge, the initial step in morphogenesis of a new SPB. Conversely, cells with hyper-active Cdc14 duplicate SPBs, but fail to induce their separation.\nConclusion\r\nOur findings implicate reversal of key CDK-dependent phosphorylations in the differential licensing of cyclical events at the meiosis I to meiosis I transition.', u'/articles/2-2/v1', [], [u'The Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell Biology, Institute of Cell Biology, School of Biological Sciences, Edinburgh, UK', u'Chair of Bioanalytics, Institute of Biotechnology, Technische Universit\xe4t Berlin, Berlin, Germany']]
[u'Myeloid 12/15-LOX regulates B cell numbers and innate immune antibody levels in vivo', ['Sarah N. Lauder', 'Victoria J Tyrrell', 'Keith Allen-Redpath', 'Maceler Aldrovandi', 'David Gray', 'Peter Collins', 'Simon A Jones', 'Philip R Taylor', "Valerie O'Donnell"], u'2017/01/04', u'Background. The myeloid enzyme 12/15-lipoxygenase (LOX), which generates bioactive oxidized lipids, has been implicated in numerous inflammatory diseases, with several studies demonstrating an improvement in pathology in mice lacking the enzyme. However, the ability of 12/15-LOX to directly regulate B cell function has not been studied.\n\nMethods. The influence of 12/15-LOX on B cell phenotype and function, and IgM generation, was compared using wildtype (WT) and 12/15-LOX (Alox15-/-) deficient mice. The proliferative and functional capacity of splenic CD19+ B cells was measured in vitro in response to various toll-like receptor agonists.\n\nResults. WT and Alox15-/- displayed comparable responses. However in vivo, splenic B cell numbers were significantly elevated in Alox15-/- mice with a corresponding elevation in titres of total IgM in lung, gut and serum, and lower serum IgM directed against the 12/15-LOX product, 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid-phosphatidylethanolamine (HETE-PE).\n\nDiscussion. Myeloid 12/15-LOX can regulate B cell numbers and innate immune antibody levels in vivo, potentially contributing to its ability to regulate inflammatory disease. Furthermore, the alterations seen in 12/15-LOX deficiency likely result from changes in the equilibrium of the immune system that develop from birth. Further studies in disease models are warranted to elucidate the contribution of 12/15-LOX mediated alterations in B cell numbers and innate immune antibody generation to driving inflammation in vivo.', u'/articles/2-1/v1', [], [u'Systems Immunity Research Institute, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK', u'Institute of Infection & Immunity, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK', u'Institute of Immunology and Infection Research, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK']]
