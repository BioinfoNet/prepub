Hurles', 'Michael Parker'], u'2017/02/24', u'Despite advances in genomic science stimulating an explosion of literature around returning health-related findings, the possibility of returning entire genome sequences to individual research participants has not been widely considered. Through direct involvement in large-scale translational genomics studies, we have identified a number of logistical challenges that would need to be overcome prior to returning individual genome sequence data, including verifying that the data belong to the requestor and providing appropriate informatics support. In addition, we identify a number of ethico-legal issues that require careful consideration, including returning data to family members, mitigating against unintended consequences, and ensuring appropriate governance. Finally, recognising that there is an opportunity cost to addressing these issues, we make some specific pragmatic suggestions for studies that are considering whether to share individual genomic datasets with individual study participants. If data are shared, research should be undertaken into the personal, familial and societal impact of receiving individual genome sequence data.', u'/articles/2-15/v1', [], [u'Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton, Cambridge, CB10 1SA, UK', u'East Anglian Medical Genetics Service, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge Biomedical Campus, Cambridge, CB2 0QQ, UK', u'MRC Human Genetics Unit, MRC IGMM, University of Edinburgh, Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, EH4 2XU, UK', u'The Ethox Centre, Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 7LF, UK']]

Methods: By reducing glucose, we induced energetic stress in two rodent \u03b2-cell models to assess effects on cellular function. Results: Culturing rat insulin-secreting INS-1 cells in low glucose conditions caused a rapid reduction in whole cell respiration, associated with elevated mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production, and an altered glucose-stimulated insulin secretion profile. Prolonged exposure to reduced glucose directly impaired mitochondrial function and reduced autophagy. Conclusions: Insulinoma cell lines provide a useful model of mechanisms affecting \u03b2-cell mitochondrial function or studying mitochondrial associated drug toxicity.', u'/articles/2-14/v1', [], [u'Nuffield Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, The Women\u2019s Centre, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK', u'Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK', u'BRC Translational Immunology Lab, NIHR, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK', u'Institute of Cellular Medicine, Haematological Sciences, Medical School, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK', u'Clinical Biochemistry, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK', u'Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK', u'Department of Paediatrics, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland', u'Luxcel BioSciences Ltd, BioInnovation Centre, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland']]
