[u'Interventions at the end of life \u2013 a taxonomy for \u2018overlapping consensus\u2019', ['David Clark', 'Hamilton Inbadas', 'Ben Colburn', 'Catriona Forrest', 'Naomi Richards', 'Sandy Whitelaw', 'Shahaduz Zaman'], u'2017/02/02', u'Context: Around the world there is increasing interest in end of life issues. An unprecedented number of people dying in future decades will put new strains on families, communities, services and governments.\xa0 It will also have implications for representations of death and dying within society and for the overall orientation of health and social care. What interventions are emerging in the face of these challenges?\nMethods: We conceptualize a comprehensive taxonomy of interventions, defined as \u2018organized responses to end of life issues\u2019.\nFindings: We classify the range of end of life interventions into 10 substantive categories: policy, advocacy, educational, ethico-legal, service, clinical, research, cultural, intangible, self-determined. We distinguish between two empirical aspects of any end of life intervention: the \u2018locus\u2019 refers to the space or spaces in which it is situated; the \u2018focus\u2019 captures its distinct character and purpose. We also contend that end of life interventions can be seen conceptually in two ways \u2013 as \u2018frames\u2019 (organized responses that primarily construct a shared understanding of an end of life issue) or as \u2018instruments\u2019 (organized responses that assume a shared understanding and then move to act in that context).\nConclusions: Our taxonomy opens up the debate about end of life interventions in new ways to provide protagonists, activists, policy makers, clinicians, researchers and educators with a comprehensive framework in which to place their endeavours and more effectively to assess their efficacy. Following the inspiration of political philosopher John Rawls, we seek to foster an \u2018overlapping consensus\u2019 on how interventions at the end of life can be construed, understood and assessed.', u'/articles/2-7/v1', [], [u'School of Interdisciplinary Studies, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK', u'School of Humanities, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK']]
