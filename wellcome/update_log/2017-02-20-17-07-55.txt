Kariuki', 'Clifford Mwita', 'Samson Gwer', 'Leah Mwai', 'Charles R.J.C. Newton'], u'2017/02/20', u'Background: Antimalarial drugs affect the central nervous system, but it is difficult to differentiate the effect of these drugs from that of the malaria illness. We conducted a systematic review to determine the association between anti-malarial drugs and mental and neurological impairment in humans.\xa0Methods: We systematically searched online databases, including Medline/PubMed, PsychoInfo, and Embase, for articles published up to 14th July 2016. Pooled prevalence, heterogeneity and factors associated with prevalence of mental and neurological manifestations were determined using meta-analytic techniques.\xa0Results: Of the 2,349 records identified in the initial search, 51 human studies met the eligibility criteria. The median pooled prevalence range of mental and neurological manifestations associated with antimalarial drugs ranged from 0.7% (dapsone) to 48.3% (minocycline) across all studies, while it ranged from 0.6% (pyrimethamine) to 42.7% (amodiaquine) during treatment of acute malaria, and 0.7% (primaquine/dapsone) to 55.0% (sulfadoxine) during prophylaxis. Pooled prevalence of mental and neurological manifestations across all studies was associated with an increased number of antimalarial drugs (prevalence ratio= 5.51 (95%CI, 1.05-29.04); P=0.045) in a meta-regression analysis. Headaches (15%) and dizziness (14%) were the most common mental and neurological manifestations across all studies. Of individual antimalarial drugs still on the market, mental and neurological manifestations were most common with the use of sulphadoxine (55%) for prophylaxis studies and amodiaquine (42.7%) for acute malaria studies. Mefloquine affected more domains of mental and neurological manifestations than any other antimalarial drug.\xa0Conclusions: Antimalarial drugs, particularly those used for prophylaxis, may be associated with mental and neurological manifestations, and the number of antimalarial drugs taken determines the association. Mental and neurological manifestations should be assessed following the use of antimalarial drugs.', u'/articles/2-13/v1', [], [u'KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Centre for Geographic Medicine Research (Coast), Kilifi, Kenya', u'Department of Surgery, Thika Level 5 Hospital, Thika, Kenya', u'Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Affiliate Centre for Evidence-Based Healthcare in Kenya, Clinical Research Evidence Synthesis and Translation Unit, Afya Research Africa, Nairobi, Kenya', u'Department of Medical Physiology, School of Medicine, Kenyatta University, Nairobi, Kenya', u'Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK']]
[u'Crude childhood vaccination coverage in West Africa: Trends and predictors of completeness', ['Jacob S. Kazungu', 'Ifedayo M.O. Adetifa'], u'2017/02/15', u'Background: Africa has the lowest childhood vaccination coverage worldwide. If the full benefits of childhood vaccination programmes are to be enjoyed in sub-Saharan Africa, all countries need to improve on vaccine delivery to achieve and sustain high coverage. In this paper, we review trends in vaccination coverage, dropouts between vaccine doses and explored the country-specific predictors of complete vaccination in West Africa.\xa0Methods: We utilized datasets from the Demographic and Health Surveys Program, available for Benin, Burkina Faso, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo, to obtain coverage for Bacillus Calmette-Guerin, polio, measles, and diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus (DPT) vaccines in children aged 12 \u2013 23 months. We also calculated the DPT1-to-DPT3 and DPT1-to-measles dropouts, and proportions of the fully immunised child (FIC). Factors predictive of FIC were explored using Chi-squared tests and multivariable logistic regression.\xa0Results: Overall, there was a trend of increasing vaccination coverage. The proportion of FIC varied significantly by country (range 24.1-81.4%, mean 49%). DPT1-to-DPT3 dropout was high (range 5.1% -33.9%, mean 16.3%). Similarly, DPT1-measles dropout exceeded 10% in all but four countries. Although no single risk factor was consistently associated with FIC across these countries, maternal education, delivery in a health facility, possessing a vaccine card and a recent post delivery visit to a health facility were the key predictors of complete vaccination.\xa0Conclusions: The low numbers of fully immunised children and high dropout between vaccine doses highlights weaknesses and the need to strengthen the healthcare and routine immunization delivery systems in this region. Country-specific correlates of complete vaccination should be explored further to identify interventions required to increase vaccination coverage. Despite the promise of an increasing trend in vaccination coverage in West African countries, more effort is required to attain and maintain global vaccination coverage targets.', u'/articles/2-12/v1', [], [u'Epidemiology and Demography Department, KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Centre for Geographic Medicine Research (Coast), Kilifi, Kenya', u'Department of Public Health, Pwani University, Kilifi, Kenya', u'Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK', u'College of Medicine, University of Lagos, Lagos, Nigeria']]
[u'Using Mendelian randomization to determine causal effects of maternal pregnancy (intrauterine) exposures on offspring outcomes: Sources of bias and methods for assessing them', ['Deborah Lawlor', 'Rebecca Richmond', 'Nicole Warrington', 'George McMahon', 'George Davey Smith', 'Jack Bowden', 'David M Evans'], u'2017/02/14', u'Mendelian randomization (MR), the use of genetic variants as instrumental variables (IVs) to test causal effects, is increasingly used in aetiological epidemiology. Few of the methodological developments in MR have considered the specific situation of using genetic IVs to test the causal effect of exposures in pregnant women on postnatal offspring outcomes. In this paper, we describe specific ways in which the IV assumptions might be violated when MR is used to test such intrauterine effects. We highlight the importance of considering the extent to which there is overlap between genetic variants in offspring that influence their outcome with genetic variants used as IVs in their mothers. Where there is overlap, and particularly if it generates a strong association of maternal genetic IVs with offspring outcome via the offspring genotype, the exclusion restriction assumption of IV analyses will be violated. We recommend a set of analyses that ought to be considered when MR is used to address research questions concerned with intrauterine effects on post-natal offspring outcomes, and provide details of how these can be undertaken and interpreted. These additional analyses include the use of genetic data from offspring and fathers, examining associations using maternal non-transmitted alleles, and using simulated data in sensitivity analyses (for which we provide code). We explore the extent to which new methods that have been developed for exploring violation of the exclusion restriction assumption in the two-sample setting (MR-Egger and median based methods) might be used when exploring intrauterine effects in one-sample MR. We provide a list of recommendations that researchers should use when applying MR to test the effects of intrauterine exposures on postnatal offspring outcomes and use an illustrative example with real data to demonstrate how our recommendations can be applied and subsequent results appropriately interpreted.', u'/articles/2-11/v1', [], [u'Medical Research Council Integrative Epidemiology Unit, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK', u'School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK', u'University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, Translational Research Institute, Brisbane, Australia', u'School of Women\u2019s and Infants\u2019 Health, The University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia']]

Adams'], u'2017/02/10', u'BACKGROUND: Olfactory receptors (ORs) recognize odorant molecules and activate a signal transduction pathway that ultimately leads to the perception of smell. This process also modulates the apoptotic cycle of olfactory sensory neurons in an olfactory receptor-specific manner. Recent reports indicate that some olfactory receptors are expressed in tissues other than the olfactory epithelium suggesting that they may have pleiotropic roles.\nMETHODS: We investigated the expression of 301 olfactory receptor genes in a comprehensive panel of 968 cancer cell lines.\nRESULTS: Forty-nine per cent of cell lines show expression of at least one olfactory receptor gene. Some receptors display a broad pattern of expression across tumour types, while others were expressed in cell lines from a particular tissue. Additionally, most of the cancer cell lines expressing olfactory receptors express the effectors necessary for OR-mediated signal transduction. Remarkably, among cancer cell lines, OR2C3 is exclusively expressed in melanoma lines. We also confirmed the expression of OR2C3 in human melanomas, but not in normal melanocytes.\nCONCLUSIONS: The pattern of OR2C3 expression is suggestive of a functional role in the development and/or progression of melanoma.

[u'First report of the East African kdr mutation in an Anopheles gambiae mosquito in C\xf4te d\u2019Ivoire', ['Mouhamadou Chouaibou', 'Fodjo Behi Kouadio', 'Emmanuel Tia', 'Luc Djogbenou'], u'2017/02/09', u"Background. The intensive use of insecticides in public health and agriculture has led to the development of insecticide resistances in malaria vectors across sub-Saharan Africa countries in the last two decades. The kdr target site point mutation which is among the best characterised resistance mechanisms seems to be changing its distribution patterns on the African continent. The 1014F\xa0kdr mutation originally described only in West Africa is spreading to East Africa while the 1014S\xa0kdr mutation originally described in East Africa, is spreading to West and Central Africa. However, the East-kdr mutation has not been reported in C\xf4te d'Ivoire so far.\nMethods. Immature stages of Anopheles gambiae s.l. were collected from breeding sites at the outskirts of Yamoussoukro, C\xf4te d'Ivoire. Emerging 3\u20135 day old adult female mosquitoes were tested for susceptibility to deltamethrin 0.05%, malathion 5%, bendiocarb 1% and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) 4% according to WHO standard procedures. A total of 50 An.\xa0gambiae\xa0s.l. specimens were drawn at random for DNA extraction and identification down to the species level. A subsample of 30 mosquitoes was tested for the East-African kdr mutation using a Taqman assay.\nResults. The tested mosquito population appeared to be strongly resistant to deltamethrin (1.03% mortality), bendiocarb (38.46% mortality) and DDT (0% mortality) with probable resistance observed for malathion (92.47%). Among the 41 mosquitoes that were successfully characterized, An.\xa0coluzzii was predominant (68.3%) followed by An.\xa0gambiae\xa0s.s. (19.5%) and a few hybrids (7.3%). Out of 30 specimens genotyped for East-kdr, a single hybrid mosquito appeared to be heterozygous for the mutation.\nConclusion. The present study revealed the presence of the East-kdr mutation in C\xf4te d\u2019Ivoire for the first time in An.\xa0gambiae and highlights the urgent need to start monitoring the allele and genotype frequencies.", u'/articles/2-8/v1', [], [u"Centre Suisse de Recherches Scientifiques en C\xf4te d\u2019Ivoire (CSRS), Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire", u"Universit\xe9 Nangui Abrogoua, Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire", u"Centre d'Entomologie M\xe9dicale et V\xe9t\xe9rinaire, Universit\xe9 Alassane Ouattara, Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire", u'Institut R\xe9gional de Sant\xe9 Publique, Ouidah, Benin', u'Universit\xe9 d\u2019Abomey-Calavi, Ouidah, Benin']]
