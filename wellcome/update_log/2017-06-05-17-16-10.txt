[u'Inhibition of IRE1\u03b1-mediated XBP1 mRNA cleavage by XBP1 reveals a novel regulatory process during the unfolded protein response', ['Fiona Chalmers', 'Bernadette Sweeney', 'Katharine Cain', 'Neil J. Bulleid'], u'2017/06/05', u'Background: The mammalian endoplasmic reticulum (ER) continuously adapts to the cellular secretory load by the activation of an unfolded protein response (UPR).\xa0 This stress response results in expansion of the ER, upregulation of proteins involved in protein folding and degradation, and attenuation of protein synthesis.\xa0 The response is orchestrated by three signalling pathways each activated by a specific signal transducer, either inositol requiring enzyme \u03b1 (IRE1\u03b1), double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase-like ER kinase (PERK) or activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6).\xa0 Activation of IRE1\u03b1 results in its oligomerisation, autophosphorylation and stimulation of its ribonuclease activity.\xa0 The ribonuclease initiates the splicing of an intron from mRNA encoding the transcription factor, X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1), as well as degradation of specific mRNAs and microRNAs. Methods: To investigate the consequence of expression of exogenous XBP1, we generated a stable cell-line expressing spliced XBP1 mRNA under the control of an inducible promotor.\xa0 Results: Following induction of expression, high levels of XBP1 protein were detected, which allowed upregulation of target genes in the absence of induction of the UPR.\xa0 Remarkably under stress conditions, the expression of exogenous XBP1 repressed splicing of endogenous XBP1 mRNA without repressing the activation of PERK.\xa0 Conclusions: These results illustrate that a feedback mechanism exists to attenuate activation of the Ire1\u03b1 ribonuclease activity in the presence of XBP1.', u'/articles/2-36/v1', [], [u'Institute of Molecular, Cellular and Systems Biology, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, G12 8QQ, UK', u'UCB Pharma Slough, Slough, SL1 3WE, UK', u'', u'', u'Fiona Chalmers', u'', u'Roles:', u'Investigation,                                                                                     Validation,                                                                                     Writing \u2013 Original Draft Preparation', u'', u'Bernadette Sweeney', u'', u'Roles:', u'Funding Acquisition,                                                                                     Project Administration', u'', u'Katharine Cain', u'', u'Roles:', u'Conceptualization,                                                                                     Funding Acquisition,                                                                                     Project Administration', u'', u'Neil J.
