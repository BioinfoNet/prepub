[u'Making the most of RNA-seq: Pre-processing sequencing data with Opossum for reliable SNP variant detection', ['Laura Oikkonen', 'Stefano Lise'], u'2017/01/17', u'Identifying variants from RNA-seq (transcriptome sequencing) data is a cost-effective and versatile alternative to whole-genome sequencing. However, current variant callers do not generally behave well with RNA-seq data due to reads encompassing intronic regions. We have developed a software programme called Opossum to address this problem. Opossum pre-processes RNA-seq reads prior to variant calling, and although it has been designed to work specifically with Platypus, it can be used equally well with other variant callers such as GATK HaplotypeCaller. In this work, we show that using Opossum in conjunction with either Platypus or GATK HaplotypeCaller maintains precision and improves the sensitivity for SNP detection compared to the GATK Best Practices pipeline. In addition, using it in combination with Platypus offers a substantial reduction in run times compared to the GATK pipeline so it is ideal when there are only limited time or computational resources available.', u'/articles/2-6/v1', [], [u'Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK', u'Centre for Evolution and Cancer, The Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, UK']]
[u"To 'take their place among the productive members of society': Vocational rehabilitation of WWI wounded at Erskine", ['Jennifer Novotny'], u'2017/01/17', u'In 1916, the foundation of the Princess Louise Scottish Hospital for Limbless Sailors and Soldiers (still in existence today as Erskine), on the banks of the River Clyde in Scotland, was a direct response to the need for specialised medical facilities to deal with the unprecedented number of injured service personnel returning from the Great War. At the hospital, the West of Scotland medical and industrial communities came together to mend broken bodies with prosthetic technology, as well as physical and mental rehabilitation to prepare the limbless to re-enter the job market. This paper explores the establishment of manual therapy workshops at Erskine and how such programmes of vocational rehabilitation were culturally informed by the concerns and anxieties of both the military and civilian populations of the First World War-era.', u'/articles/2-5/v1', [], [u'University of Glasgow, Glasgow, Scotland, UK']]
[u'Tuberculosis control in postcolonial South India and beyond: Fractured sovereignties in international health, 1948-1960', ['Vivek Neelakantan'], u'2017/01/13', u'Between 1948 and 1960, South India (Madras State) and Southeast Asia emerged as global centres for tuberculosis control. This article attempts to situate tuberculosis control of these two regions within the broader context of international health. It investigates the unique ways in which tuberculosis control in Madras state reflected the inner tensions between the notional magic bullet approach, which focuses on specific cures to root out the cause of the disease, and a more holistic approach that relates disease prevention to overall well-being of the population. The implementation of tuberculosis control across South India and Southeast Asia shed light on the nature of the post-colonial state sovereignty in public health. Across India, as in Southeast Asia, the state sovereignty appertaining to the implementation of health policy was fractured, as evident in the opposition to the Bacillus Calmette\u2013Gu\xe9rin (BCG) vaccination. Based on a wide range of archival materials, this article examines tuberculosis control in South India and Southeast Asia between 1948 and 1960. It situates tuberculosis control within the context of nationalist discourse and preventive medicine. In doing so, it adds not only to the historiography of tuberculosis in non-Western contexts, which has hitherto focused on India, Sri Lanka, Africa, or the Caribbean, but also to the relatively new field of Southeast Asian medical history.', u'/articles/2-4/v1', [], [u'Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India']]
[u"Envy's pathology: Historical contexts", ['Lina Minou'], u'2017/01/09', u'This article is concerned with the physicality of envy in early modern- and eighteenth-century health contexts. The discussion brings together descriptions of the effects of envy on the body of the envier, mainly from works of physiology and health preservation, but also from literary and spiritual writings. These depictions of envy are studied beyond their symbolism and with a view to establish whether they are meaningful according to the medical paradigms of the time in which they occur. The discussion begins by acknowledging the status of envy as a \u2018disease\u2019 and looks to the specific ways in which the discourse of envy conveys this sense. I find that in the early modern discourse envy is always pathological, that is, it is experienced as disease and signifies disease in general and several diseases in particular. Moreover, envy is uniquely placed to convey pathology on account of its being connected to inherently pathogenic elements of the humoural theory. Specifically, envy is physiologically connected to melancholy, and the way it is presented comes close to attributes assigned to black bile. In addition, envy realizes pathology, the occurrence of disease in the body, by impairing the vital process of digestion and thus depriving the person from proper nourishment and sustenance. This article concludes by looking at envy within an eighteenth-century context. It finds that by the end of the century envy undergoes a significant shift away from its status as disease and considers the reasons for this change.', u'/articles/2-3/v1', [], [u'Independent Researcher, Nottingham, UK']]
[u'Cdc14 phosphatase directs centrosome re-duplication at the meiosis I to meiosis II transition in budding yeast', ['Colette Fox', 'Juan Zou', 'Juri Rappsilber', 'Adele L. Marston'], u'2017/01/05', u'Background\r\nGametes are generated through a specialized cell division called meiosis, in which ploidy is reduced by half because two consecutive rounds of chromosome segregation, meiosis I and meiosis II, occur without intervening DNA replication. This contrasts with the mitotic cell cycle where DNA replication and chromosome segregation alternate to maintain the same ploidy. At the end of mitosis, CDKs are inactivated. This low CDK state in late mitosis/G1 allows for critical preparatory events for DNA replication and centrosome/spindle pole body (SPB) duplication. However, their execution is inhibited until S phase, where further preparatory events are also prevented. This \u201clicensing\u201d ensures that both the chromosomes and the centrosomes/SPBs replicate exactly once per cell cycle, thereby maintaining constant ploidy. Crucially, between meiosis I and meiosis II, centrosomes/SPBs must be re-licensed, but DNA re-replication must be avoided. In budding yeast, the Cdc14 protein phosphatase triggers CDK down regulation to promote exit from mitosis. Cdc14 also regulates the meiosis I to meiosis II transition, though its mode of action has remained unclear.\nMethods\r\nFluorescence and electron microscopy was combined with proteomics to probe SPB duplication in cells with inactive or hyperactive Cdc14.\nResults\r\nWe demonstrate that Cdc14 ensures two successive nuclear divisions by re-licensing SPBs at the meiosis I to meiosis II transition. We show that Cdc14 is asymmetrically enriched on a single SPB during anaphase I and provide evidence that this enrichment promotes SPB re-duplication. Cells with impaired Cdc14 activity fail to promote extension of the SPB half-bridge, the initial step in morphogenesis of a new SPB. Conversely, cells with hyper-active Cdc14 duplicate SPBs, but fail to induce their separation.\nConclusion\r\nOur findings implicate reversal of key CDK-dependent phosphorylations in the differential licensing of cyclical events at the meiosis I to meiosis I transition.', u'/articles/2-2/v1', [], [u'The Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell Biology, Institute of Cell Biology, School of Biological Sciences, Edinburgh, UK', u'Chair of Bioanalytics, Institute of Biotechnology, Technische Universit\xe4t Berlin, Berlin, Germany']]
[u'Myeloid 12/15-LOX regulates B cell numbers and innate immune antibody levels in vivo', ['Sarah N. Lauder', 'Victoria J Tyrrell', 'Keith Allen-Redpath', 'Maceler Aldrovandi', 'David Gray', 'Peter Collins', 'Simon A Jones', 'Philip R Taylor', "Valerie O'Donnell"], u'2017/01/04', u'Background. The myeloid enzyme 12/15-lipoxygenase (LOX), which generates bioactive oxidized lipids, has been implicated in numerous inflammatory diseases, with several studies demonstrating an improvement in pathology in mice lacking the enzyme. However, the ability of 12/15-LOX to directly regulate B cell function has not been studied.\n\nMethods. The influence of 12/15-LOX on B cell phenotype and function, and IgM generation, was compared using wildtype (WT) and 12/15-LOX (Alox15-/-) deficient mice. The proliferative and functional capacity of splenic CD19+ B cells was measured in vitro in response to various toll-like receptor agonists.\n\nResults. WT and Alox15-/- displayed comparable responses. However in vivo, splenic B cell numbers were significantly elevated in Alox15-/- mice with a corresponding elevation in titres of total IgM in lung, gut and serum, and lower serum IgM directed against the 12/15-LOX product, 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid-phosphatidylethanolamine (HETE-PE).\n\nDiscussion. Myeloid 12/15-LOX can regulate B cell numbers and innate immune antibody levels in vivo, potentially contributing to its ability to regulate inflammatory disease. Furthermore, the alterations seen in 12/15-LOX deficiency likely result from changes in the equilibrium of the immune system that develop from birth. Further studies in disease models are warranted to elucidate the contribution of 12/15-LOX mediated alterations in B cell numbers and innate immune antibody generation to driving inflammation in vivo.', u'/articles/2-1/v1', [], [u'Systems Immunity Research Institute, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK', u'Institute of Infection & Immunity, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK', u'Institute of Immunology and Infection Research, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK']]
