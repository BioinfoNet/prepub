[u'Overexpression of AmRosea1 Gene Confers Drought and Salt Tolerance in Rice', ['Mingzhu Dou', 'Sanhong Fan', 'Suxin Yang', 'Rongfeng Huang', 'Huiyun Yu', 'Xianzhong Feng'], u'December 14 2016', u'Ectopic expression of the MYB transcription factor of AmROSEA1 from Antirrhinum majus has been reported to change anthocyanin and other metabolites in several species. In this study, we found that overexpression of AmRosea1 significantly improved the tolerance of transgenic rice to drought and salinity stress. Transcriptome analysis revealed that a considerable amount of stress-related genes were affected by exogenous AmRosea1 during both drought and salinity stress treatments. These affected genes are involved in stress signal transduction, the hormone signal pathway, ion homeostasis and the enzymes that remove peroxides. This work suggests that the AmRosea1 gene is a potential candidate for genetic engineering of crops.', u'/manuscript/201612.0074/v1', [u'Plant Sciences'], []]
