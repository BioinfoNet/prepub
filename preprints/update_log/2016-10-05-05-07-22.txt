[u'Inhibitory Interactions of Aspalathus linearis (Rooibos) Extracts and Compounds, Aspalathin and Z-2-(\u03b2-D-glucopyranosyloxy)-3-phenylpropenoic acid, on Cytochromes Metabolizing Hypoglycemic and Hypolipidemic Drugs', ['Oelfah Patel', 'Christo J.F. Muller', 'Elizabeth Joubert', 'Johan Louw', 'Bernd Rosenkranz', 'Charles Awortwe'], u'October 4 2016', u'Rooibos extract, due to its glucose and lipid lowering effects, has potential as a nutraceutical for improvement of metabolic dysfunction. Potential herb-drug interactions as a result of the use of natural products are of increasing concern. Cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, are important in the metabolism of hypoglycemic drugs such as thiazolidinediones (TZDs) and sulfonylureas, and hypocholesterolemic drugs such as atorvastatin. This study investigated the effects of rooibos extracts, prepared from \u201cunfermented\u201d and \u201cfermented\u201d rooibos plant material and two of the major bioactive compounds, Z-2-(\u03b2-D-glucopyranosyloxy)-3-phenylpropenoic acid (PPAG) and aspalathin (ASP), on Vivid\xae recombinant CYP450 enzymes. Unfermented (GRT) and fermented (FRE) rooibos extract inhibited the activity of CYP2C8 (7.69 \xb1 8.85 \xb5g/ml and 8.93 \xb1 8.88 \xb5g/ml, respectively) and CYP3A4 (31.33 \xb1 4.69 \xb5g/ml and 51.44 \xb1 4.31 \xb5g/ml, respectively) based on their respective IC50 concentrations. Both extracts dose- and time-dependently inhibited CYP2C8 activity, but only time-dependently inhibited CYP2C9. CYP3A4 showed concentration-dependent inhibition by ASP, GRT and FRE at 25, 50 and 100 \xb5g/ml concentrations. ASP, GRT and FRE time-dependently inhibited CYP3A4 activity with GRT and FRE showing a more potent time-dependent inhibition, comparable to erythromycin. These findings suggest that herb-drug interactions may occur when nutraceuticals containing rooibos extracts are co-administered with hypoglycemic drugs such as TZDs, sulfonylureas and dyslipidemic drug, atorvastatin.', u'/manuscript/201610.0007/v1', [u'Pharmacology & Toxicology'], [u'Biomedical Research and Innovation Platform, South African Medical Research Council, P.O.

Due to higher apprehensions of pollution, violence and poverty, our modern cities no longer ensure a good quality of life so they become unhealthy environments. This study aims to measure the socio-environmental and hematologic profile of residents of Santo Andr\xe9\u2019s landfill \u2013 \u201cBairro Esp\xedrito Santo\u201d by using the contextualization of the studied area. The research method is Observational type and from Retrospective cohort and by convenience sampling in Santo Andr\xe9 in the Greater ABC region. The study determined a socio environmental profile and the hematologic diseases screening related to a close location to the landfill. The disease manifests itself within a broad spectrum of symptoms that causes changes in blood count parameters. The full blood counts analysis was performed, indicating that the blood counts of residents living near the landfill \xa0led to positive hematological changes and diseases like Leukopenia, Anemia, Neutropenia and lymphocytosis were the most common changes. However it is considered that the proof of the relation of cause- effect to environmental exposures that may trigger chronic manifestations in humans requires specific studies that are often complicated.', u'/manuscript/201610.0005/v1', [u'Other'], [u'Environmental Health Management Department \u2013ABC MedSchool, Santo Andr\xe9, SP, Brazil; laboratoriofmabc@yahoo.com.br', u'Environmental Health Management Department \u2013ABC MedSchool, Santo Andr\xe9, SP, Brazil.', u'Biological Sciences Department \u2013 Institute of Environmental, Chemistry and Farmaceutical Sciences \u2013 Federal University of S\xe3o Paulo, Diadema, SP, Brazil', u'Environmental health Department \u2013 IPC, EsTesC, Coimbra Health School, Coimbra, Portugal', u'Complementary Sciences Department - IPC, EsTesC, Coimbra Health School, Coimbra, Portugal', u'Environmental Health Management Department \u2013ABC MedSchool, Santo Andr\xe9, SP, Brazil']]
