[u'Mitochondrial Genomes Provide Insights into the Phylogeny of Lauxanioidea (Diptera: Cyclorrhapha)', [], u'March 24 2017', u'The superfamily Lauxanioidea is a significant dipteran clade including over 2500 known species in three families: Lauxaniidae, Celyphidae and Chamaemyiidae. We sequenced the first five (three complete and two partial) lauxanioid mitochondrial (mt) genomes, and used them to reconstruct the phylogeny of this group. The lauxanioid mt genomes are typical of the Diptera, containing all 37 genes usually present in bilaterian animals. A total of three conserved intergenic sequences have been reported across the Cyclorrhapha. The inferred secondary structure of 22 tRNAs suggested five substitution patterns among the Cyclorrhapha. The control region in the Lauxanioidea has apparently evolved very fast, but four conserved structural elements were detected in all three complete mt genome sequences. Phylogenetic relationships based on the mt genome data were inferred by Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian methods. The traditional relationships between families within the Lauxanioidea, (Chamaemyiidae + (Lauxaniidae + Celyphidae)), was corroborated, however, the higher level relationships between cyclorrhaphan superfamilies are mostly poorly supported.', u'/manuscript/201703.0182/v1', [u'Entomology'], []]
[u'Synthesis and Preliminarily Cytotoxicity to A549, HCT116 and MCF-7 Cell Lines of Thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine Derivatives Containing Isoxazole Moiety', [], u'March 24 2017', u'Under the guidance of our previous achievements, and in order to extend this small molecular library. In current work, other 21 novel structures of thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidines containing isoxazole-moiety (1a-1u) were firstly synthesized and the cytotoxicity to A549, HCT116 and MCF-7 cell lines was evaluated using the MTT method. The results showed that most target compounds exhibited good to excellent cytotoxicity to A549, HCT116 and MCF-7 cell lines, especially 6-Methyl-4-{[3-(4-chlorophenyl)-isoxazol-5-yl-]-methoxy-}-thieno[2,3-d]-pyrimidine (1e) exhibited a broad-spectrum and the most potent cytotoxicity to A549, HCT116 and MCF-7 cell lines (IC50s: 2.79, 6.69 and 4.21\xd710-3 \u03bcM, respectively) as compared with the reference drug gefitinib (IC50s: 17.90, 21.55 and 20.68 \u03bcM, respectively). 1e can be seen as the best drug candidates for development of anticancer drugs.', u'/manuscript/201703.0190/v1', [u'Oncology & Oncogenics'], []]
[u'Combined Laser Blood Illumination by Red (635 nm) and UV (365-405 nm) Light in the Treatment of Small Domestic Animals with Allergic Dermatitis', [], u'March 24 2017', u'Background: The prevalence of atopic dermatitis in domestic animals is one of the problems of modern veterinary. Treating with standard techniques using chemotherapeutic agents not always leads to a positive result of therapy; moreover, many drugs produce adverse side effects. Methods: Low level laser therapy, in particular, intravenous laser blood illumination (ILBI) has a pronounced and long-lasting impact on the immune system of animals. The combined technique including ILBI-635 (635 nm, 2 mW, 5 min) and LUVBI\xae (365 nm, 2 mW, 3 min) every other day provides a positive change in clinical status of cats with allergic dermatitis after the 3rd-4th treatment session. Results: The increased level of erythrocytes and hemoglobin was identified in the course of treatment, and it indirectly indicates increased blood transport activity, which improves trophic provision and microcirculation. A double reduction of leukocytes and a significant decrease of neutrophil cells indicate the immunomodulatory effect of LILI (low-intensity laser illumination). The increase in the percentage of lymphocytes and the decrease of eosinophils and monocytes against the background of basophil concentrations deviations within physiological concentration result in the reduction of inflammatory mediators expression that induce itching. The reduction of total IgE concentration 32 times against control on the 7th day of treatment correlates with the decrease in the quantitative content of peripheral blood eosinophils, indicating the decrease in severity of an allergic process. Conclusion: LLLT is recommended against the background of standard drug therapy to achieve quick clinical outcome together with a long-lasting prolonged effect.', u'/manuscript/201703.0186/v1', [u'Veterinary Medicine'], []]
[u'Alluvial Gold Mining Sites as Exposure Pathways for Methyl Mercury Toxicity in Children: A Systematic Review', [], u'March 24 2017', u'Background: Informal business activities are fundamental in alleviating poverty in developing countries of the world. One such activity concerns the artisanal gold mining which numerous studies have pointed out that uses mercury as the predominant element to extract gold from ore. The link between mercury and its impacts on adults and children\u2019s health have been extensively studied. Although the acute effects of mercury on adults could be mild or severe depending on the dose- response relationship the chronic effects on children is often deleterious. Aim/Objectives: The purpose of this review is to evaluate the current literature on the impacts of alluvial gold mining and the deleterious effects of mercury on children\u2019s development and cognitive functions through consumption of methyl mercury contaminated fish. Methodology: Key word search on \u201cmethyl mercury\u2019 and children development\u201d in Google scholar, Cochraine, and JStore was used to select appropriate articles. The inclusion criteria included; cohort study and exposure through fish consumption, studies on women and children, and full text articles published within sixteen (16) years of publication. Nine articles met the predefined criteria for this review. The results: The studies by Oken et al. (2005); Mary et al. (2014; Lederman et al. (2008) and Yorifu et al. (2011) produced convincing results about the exposure to MeHg and its effects on child development through consumption of contaminated fish during pregnancy and thereafter. On the other hand, the studies by (Davidson et al. 1998; Davidson et al. 2008; Davidson et al. 2006; & Jedrychowski et al. 2007) have found no adverse outcomes in children less than 6 years old from prenatal exposure. Interestingly studies by Wijngaarden et al. 2013 & Daniels et al. 2004 have shown inconclusive and inconsistent evidences thus requiring further research into the association between methyl mercury exposures and neurodevelopment disorders during infancy. Conclusion: The aforementioned studies have shown some convincing results about the consumption of fish contaminated with methyl mercury and mental retardation and low IQ in children. However none of the studies involved participants who have lived in alluvial gold mining areas to elicit a level of risk from exposure through ingestion of mercury contaminated fish.', u'/manuscript/201703.0183/v1', [u'Other'], []]
