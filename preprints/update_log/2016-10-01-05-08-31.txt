[u'Screening of Immunosuppressive Factors for Identifying Breast Cancer Malignant Phenotypes Using mRNA Microarray Datasets', ['Zhuoqi Liu', 'Xiaohong Yang', 'Yunlei Song', 'Bo Huang', 'Yingquan Xiao', 'Weifeng Zhu', 'Lehan Yu', 'Xi Liu', 'Daya Luo', 'Fusheng Wan'], u'September 30 2016', u'To screen and validate immunosuppressive factors in luminal- and basal-like breast cancer cell lines and tissue samples associated with malignant phenotypes. The mRNA microarray datasets, GSE40057 and GSE1561, were downloaded and remodelled. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. Enrichment analyses performed and the online resources, GOBO and Kaplan-Meier Plotter, were employed to screen for immunosuppressive factors associated with breast cancer malignant phenotypes. qRT-PCR and western blot were used to validate the expression of CD274 and IL8 in cell lines and immunohistochemical detected the MIF and VEGFA on tissue microarrays. The results showed that CD274 and IL8 were both upregulated in basal-like cell lines. That MIF expression was dramatically increased in patients with breast cancer metastases (p<0.05) and that VEGFA expression positively correlates with breast cancer pathologic grade (p<0.05).During the formation and development of breast cancer, immune-related genes are always activated, and immunosuppressive factors CD274, IL8, MIF and VEGFA are upregulated. Such molecules could be used as biomarkers for breast cancer prognosis. However, because individual immune-related factors can play several biological roles, the mechanistic relationship between immunosuppressive factors and breast cancer malignant phenotypes and the feasibility of their application as drug targets require further investigation.', u'/manuscript/201609.0124/v1', [u'Molecular Biology'], [u'Medical College of Nanchang University, Nanchang 330006, China', u'Department of Pathology, Affiliated Infectious Diseases Hospital, Nanchang University,  Nanchang 330002, China', u'Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of Tumor Pathogens and Molecular Pathology, Nanchang University, Nanchang 330006, China']]
