[u'Metal-Free \u03b1-C(sp3)\u2013H Functionalized Oxidative Cyclization of Tertiary N,N-Diaryl Amino Alcohols: Theoretical Approach for Mechanistic Pathway', ['Zakir Ullah', 'Mihyun Kim'], u'February 23 2017', u'The mechanistic pathway of TEMPO/I2-mediated oxidative cyclization of N,N-diaryl amino alcohols 1 is investigated in this study. Based on our direct empirical experiments, three key intermediates (the aminium radical cation 3, the \u03b1-aminoalkyl radical 4, and the iminium 5), four kind reactive species (radical TEMPO, cationic TEMPO, TEMPO-I and iodo radical) and three kind pathways (1. SET/PCET mechanism, 2. HAT/1,6-H transfer mechanism, 3. Ionic mechanism) were assumed. Under the assumption, nine free energy diagrams are acquired through DFT calculation. From the comparison of the solution phase free energy, some possibility can be excluded and then the chosen plausible mechanisms are concretized with the more stable intermediate 7.', u'/manuscript/201702.0087/v1', [u'Other'], []]
[u'Identification of Drought-Responsive microRNAs from Roots and Leaves of Alfalfa by High-Throughput Sequencing', ['Yue Li', 'Liqiang Wan', 'Shuyi Bi', 'Xiufu Wan', 'Zhenyi Li', 'Jing Cao', 'Zongyong Tong', 'Hongyu Xu', 'Feng He', 'Xianglin Li'], u'February 23 2017', u'Alfalfa, an important legume forage, is an ideal crop for sustainable agriculture and a potential bioenergy plant. Drought, one of the most common environmental stresses, substantially affects plants\u2019 growth, development and productivity. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are newly discovered gene expression regulators that have been linked to several plant stress responses. To elucidate the role of miRNAs in drought stress regulation of alfalfa, a high-throughput sequencing approach was used to analyze 12 small RNA libraries comprising of 4 samples, each with 3 biological replicates. We identified 348 known miRNAs, belonging to 80 miRNA families, from the 12 libraries and 281 novel miRNAs using Mireap software. 18 known miRNAs in roots and 12 known miRNAs in leaves were screened out as drought-responsive miRNAs. Except for miR319d and miR157a which were upregulated under drought stress, the expression pattern of drought-responsive miRNAs were different between roots and leaves in alfalfa. This is the first study discovering miR157a, miR1507, miR3512, miR3630, miR5213, miR5294, miR5368 and miR6173 are drought-responsive miRNAs. Target transcripts of drought-responsive miRNAs were computationally predicted. All 447 target genes for the known miRNAs were predicted using an online tool. This study provides a significant insight on understanding drought-responsive mechanisms of alfalfa.', u'/manuscript/201702.0085/v1', [u'Molecular Biology'], []]
