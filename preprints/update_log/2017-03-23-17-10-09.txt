[u'Preparation of Interface-Assembled Carbonyl Reductase and Its Application in Synthesis of S-Licarbazepine in Toluene/Tri-HCl Buffer Biphasic System', [], u'March 23 2017', u'S-licarbazepine was prepared by asymmetric reduction of oxcarbazepine with interface-assembled carbonyl reductase at the interface of oil/water biphasic system. The carbonyl reductase was conjugated with polystyrene in the surface of toluene/Tris-HCl biphasic system and formed a surfactant-like structure. The conversion and enantiometric excess of S-licarbazepine reached 97.39% and 99.6% when 3.97 mmol/L oxcarbazepine was reduced by interface-assembled carbonyl reductase with 60 g/L ethanol as co-substrate in toluene/Tris-HCl(12.5:10) biphasic system at 30 \xb0C, 180 rpm for 6 h.', u'/manuscript/201703.0180/v1', [u'Other'], []]
