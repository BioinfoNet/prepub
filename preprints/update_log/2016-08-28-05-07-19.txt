[u'Platycodon grandiflorus Root Extract Attenuateds Body Fat Mass, Hepatic Steatosis and Insulin Resistance through the Interplay between the Liver and Adipose Tissue', ['Ye Jin Kim', 'Ji-Young Choi', 'Ri Ryu', 'Jeonhyeon Lee', 'Su-Jung Cho', 'Eun-Young Kwon', 'Mi-Kyung Lee', 'Kwang-Hyeon Liu', 'Yu Rina', 'Mi-Kyung Sung', 'Myung-Sook Choi'], u'August 27 2016', u'The Platycodon grandiflorus root, one of Korean medicinal foods, is well known to have beneficial effects on obesity and diabetes. In this study, we demonstrated the metabolic effects of P. grandiflorus root ethanol extract (PGE), which is rich in platycodins, on diet-induced obesity. C57BL/6J mice (4-week-old males) were fed a normal diet (16.58% of kilocalories from fat), high-fat diet (HFD, 60% of kilocalories from fat), and HFD supplemented with 5% (w/w) of PGE. In the HFD-fed mice, PGE markedly suppressed the body weight gain and white fat mass to normal control level, with simultaneous increase in the expression of thermogenic genes (such as SIRT1, PPAR\u03b1, PGC-1\u03b1, and UCP1), that accompanied changes in fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and energy expenditure. Also, PGE improved insulin sensitivity through activation of the PPAR\u03b3 expression, which upregulates adiponectin while decreasing leptin gene expression in adipocytes. Furthermore, PGE improved hepatic steatosis by suppressing hepatic lipogenesis while increasing expression of FAO-associated genes such as PGC-1\u03b1. PGE normalized body fat and body weight, which is likely associated with the increased energy expenditure and thermogenic gene expression. PGE can protect from HFD-induced insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis by controlling lipid and glucose metabolism.', u'/manuscript/201608.0217/v1', [u'Nutrition'], [u'Center for Food and Nutritional Genomics Research, Kyungpook National University, 1370 San-Kyuk Dong Puk-Ku, Daegu 702-701, Korea', u'Department of Food Science and Nutrition, Kyungpook National University, 1370 San-Kyuk Dong  Puk-Ku, Daegu 702-701, Korea', u'Department of Food and Nutrition, Sunchon National University, Suncheon 540-950, Korea', u'College of Pharmacy and Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyungpook National University, 1370 San-Kyuk Dong Puk-Ku, Daegu 702-701, Korea', u'Department of Food Science and Nutrition, University of Ulsan, Ulsan 680-749, Korea', u'Department of Food and Nutrition, Sookmyung Women\u2019s University, Seoul 140-742, Korea']]
