[u'Vitamin-D Deficiency Predicts Infections in Young North Indian Children: A Secondary Data Analysis', ['Ranadip Chowdhury', 'Sunita Taneja', 'Nita Bhandari', 'Bireshwar Sinha', 'Ravi Upadhyay', 'Maharaj Kishan Bhan', 'Tor A. Strand'], u'November 8 2016', u'Recent studies have demonstrated a relationship between poor vitamin D status and respiratory infections and diarrhea among young children. Acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) and diarrhea are among the two most important causes of death in under-5 children. In this analysis, we examine the extent to which vitamin-D deficiency (<10 ng/ml) predicts these outcomes using data from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of daily folic acid and/ or vitamin B12 supplementation for six months in 6 to 30 months old children conducted in Delhi, India. Of the 960 subjects who had vitamin-D concentrations measured, 331(34.5%) were vitamin-D deficient. We found, after controlling for relevant potential confounders (age, sex, breastfeeding status, wasting, stunting, underweight, anemia status at base line and season), the risk of ALRI was significantly higher among vitamin-D deficient (OR 1.26; 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.55) compared to vitamin-D-replete children in the six months follow-up period. Vitamin-D status was not significantly associated with episodes of diarrhea and clinical pneumonia. The extent of causal relationship of vitamin-D status and ALRI needs to be explored in further studies.', u'/manuscript/201611.0049/v1', [u'Nutrition'], [u'Centre for Health Research and Development, Society for Applied Studies, New Delhi 110016, India', u'National Science Professor, Indian Institute Technology, Delhi 110016, India', u'Chair, Knowledge Integration and Translational Platform (KnIT), Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC), New Delhi 110003, India', u'Department of Research, Innlandet Hospital Trust, 2381, Norway', u'Centre for International Health, University of Bergen, Bergen 5020, Norway']]
[u'Uridine Triphosphate Thio-analogues Inhibit Platelet P2Y12 Receptors and Aggregation', ['Dursun Guenduez', 'Christian Tanislav', 'Daniel Sedding', 'Mariana Parahuleva', 'Sentot Santoso', 'Christian Troidl', 'Christian Hamm', 'Muhammad Aslam'], u'November 8 2016', u'Platelet P2Y12 is an important ADP receptor that is involved in agonists-induced platelet aggregation and is an important target for the development of anti-platelet aggregation drugs. Here the effects of thio-analogues of uridine triphosphate (UTP) on ADP-induced platelet aggregation are characterised. Using human platelet rich plasma we demonstrate that UTP inhibits P2Y12 but not P2Y1 receptors and antagonises ADP-induced platelet aggregation in a conc.-dependent manner with an IC50 value of ~250 mM against ADP (10 mM). An 8-fold increase in the platelet inhibitory activity was observed with 2-thio analogue of UTP (2S-UTP) with an IC50 value of 30 mM. A 33-fold increase in anti-platelet aggregation activity was observed with 4-thio analogue (4S-UTP) with an IC50 value of 7.5 mM. However, a 3-fold decrease in activity was observed by introducing an isobutyl group at the 4S- position. A complete loss in anti-platelet aggregation activity was observed with thio-modification of gamma phosphate of the sugar moiety which yields an enzymatically stable analogue. The interaction of UTP analogues with P2Y12 receptors was further verified by P2Y12 receptor binding assay and cAMP assay. The novel data demonstrate for the first time that 2- and 4-thio analogues of UTP are potent P2Y12 receptor antagonists that can be useful candidates for therapeutic intervention.', u'/manuscript/201611.0048/v1', [u'Pharmacology & Toxicology'], [u'Department of Cardiology/Angiology, University Hospital Giessen, 35392 Giessen, Germany', u'Department of Neurology, University Hospital Giessen, 35392 Giessen, Germany', u'Department of Cardiology/Angiology, Hannover Medical School, 30625 Hannover, Germany', u'Department of Cardiology/Angiology, University Hospital, Marburg, 35392 Giessen, Germany', u'Institute for Clinical Immunology and Transfusion Medicine, Justus Liebig University, Giessen, 35385 Giessen, Germany.']]
