[u'Molecular Cloning and Expression Analysis of COX II from Sitophilus zeamais, a Potential Action Site of AITC', ['Changliang Hou', 'Jingbo Wang', 'Hua Wu', 'Jiayu Liu', 'Zhiqing Ma', 'Juntao Feng', 'Xing Zhang'], u'August 25 2016', u'COX II containing a dual core CuA active site is one of the three core subunits of mitochondrial Cco, which plays a significant role in the physiological process. In this report, the full-length cDNA of COX\u2161 gene was cloned from Sitophilus zeamais, which had an ORF of 684 bp encoding 227 amino acids residues. The predicted COX\u2161 protein had a molecular mass of 26.2 kDa with pI value of 6.37, and multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis indicated that Sitophilus zeamais COX\u2161 had high sequence identity 78.51% with the COX\u2161 of other insect species, especially similarity to sitophilus oryzae. This gene was subcloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pET-32a, and induced by IPTG in E.coli Transetta (DE3) expression system. Finally the COX\u2161 with 6-His tag was purified using affinity chromatography with Ni2+-NTA agarose. WB showed the recombinant COX\u2161 was about 44 kD, and the concentration of fusion protein was 50\u03bcg/mL. UV-spectrophotometer and infrared spectrometer analysis showed that recombinant COX\u2161 could catalyze the oxidation of substrate Cytc, and influenced by AITC. It was found that AITC could form a hydrophobic region with COX\u2161 protein via molecular docking, besides, a sulfur atom of AITC structure could form a length of 2.9 \xc5 hydrogen bond with Leu-31. These results will provide valuable information for elucidating the role of COX\u2161 in Sitophilus zeamais responses to AITC, meanwhile, it will helpful to carry out a point mutation in AITC binding sites for the future research.', u'/manuscript/201608.0203/v1', [u'Entomology'], [u'Research and Development Centre of Biorational Pesticides, Northwest Agriculture and Forestry University, Yangling 712100, China', u'Research Center of Biopesticide Technology and Engineering, Yangling 712100, China']]
[u'Nitrogen Removal in a Horizontal Subsurface Flow Constructed Wetland Estimated Using the First-Order Kinetic Model', ['Lijuan Cui', 'Wei Li', 'Yaqiong Zhang', 'Jiaming Wei', 'Yinru Lei', 'Manyin Zhang', 'Xu Pan', 'Xinsheng Zhao', 'Kai Li', 'Wu Ma'], u'August 25 2016', u"We monitored the water quality and hydrological conditions of a horizontal subsurface constructed wetland (HSSF-CW) in Beijing, China, for 2 years. We simulated the area rate constant and the temperature coefficient with the first-order kinetic model. We examined the relationships between the nitrogen (N) removal rate, N load, seasonal variations in the N removal rate, and environmental factors, such as the area rate constant, temperature, and dissolved oxygen (DO). The effluent ammonia (NH4+-N) and nitrate (NO3\u2212-N) concentrations were significantly lower than the influent concentrations (p<0.01, n=38). The NO3\u2212-N load was significantly correlated with the removal rate (R2=0.9566, p<0.01), but the NH4+-N load was not correlated with the removal rate (R2=0.0187, p>0.01). The area rate constants of NO3\u2212-N and NH4+-N at 20 \xb0C were 27.01\xb126.49 and 16.63\xb110.58 m\u2219yr\u22121, respectively. The temperature coefficients for NO3\u2212-N and NH4+-N were estimated at 1.0042 and 0.9604, respectively. The area rate constants for NO3\u2212-N and NH4+-N were not correlated with temperature (p>0.01). The NO3\u2212-N area rate constant was correlated with the corresponding load (R2=0.9625, p<0.01). The NH4+-N area rate was correlated with DO (R2=0.6922, p<0.01), suggesting that the factors that influenced the N removal rate in this wetland met Liebig's law of the minimum.", u'/manuscript/201608.0205/v1', [u'Ecology'], [u'Institute of wetland research, Chinese academy of forestry, Beijing 100091, China', u'Beijing Hanshiqiao National Wetland Ecosystem Research Station, Beijing 101399, China', u'The Beijing Key Laboratory of Wetland Ecological Function and Restoration, Beijing 100091, China', u'School of Natural Resources, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV 26506, USA']]
