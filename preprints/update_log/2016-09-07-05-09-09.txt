[u'Chemical Compositions of Ligusticum chuanxiong Oil and Lemongrass Oil and Their Joint Action against Aphis citricola van der Goot (Hemiptera: Aphididae)', ['Chao Zhang', 'Runqiang Liu', 'Jun He', 'Zhiqing Ma', 'Xing Zhang'], u'September 6 2016', u'In order to develop novel botanical insecticides, the joint action of Ligusticum chuanxiong oil (LCO) and lemongrass oil (LO) against Aphis citricola van der Goot was determined systematically indoors and outdoors. The chemical profiles of LCO and LO as determined by gas chromatography- mass spectrometry analysis revealed that main compounds from LCO were Z-Ligustilide (44.58%) and Senkyunolide A (26.92%), and that of LO were geranial (42.16%) and neral (32.58%), respectively. The mixture of LCO and LO showed significant synergy against  A. citricola, with a common-toxicity coefficient (CTC) value of 221.46 at the optimal ratio of LCO to LO (4: 1, w/w). Based on the results of solvents and emulsifiers screening, L. Chuanxiong oil \xb7 Lemongrass oil 20% emulsifiable concentrate (20% LCO \xb7 LO EC) was developed, which was confirmed to meet the requirements of a commercial pesticide by quality test. Field trials indicated that the insecticidal activity of the diluted 20% LCO \xb7 LO EC (1000 fold dilution) was comparable to conventional pesticide (20% imidacloprid EC) on A. citricola 7 days after application. Thus, the mixture of LCO and LO has the potential to be further developed as a botanical pesticide.', u'/manuscript/201609.0021/v1', [u'Entomology'], [u'Research and Development Center of Biorational Pesticide, Northwest Agriculture & Forestry University, Yangling 712100, China', u'Shaanxi Research Center of Biopesticide Engineering & Technology, Yangling 712100, China']]
[u'Art of Music, as Harmony of the Spheres and Autism Spectrum Disorder', ['Bharathi Geetha', 'Thangaraj Sugunadevi', 'Babu Srija', 'Nagarajan Laleethambika', 'Vellingiri Balachandar'], u'September 6 2016', u'Music has the innate potential to reach all parts of the brain, stimulates certain brain areas which are not achievable through other modalities. Music Therapy (MT) is being used for more than a century to treat individuals who needs personalized care. MT optimizes motor, speech and language responsibilities of the brain and improves cognitive performance. Pervasive developmentdisorder (PDD) is a multifaceted, neuro developmental disorder and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) comes under PDD, which is defined by deficiencies in three principal spheres: social connection with others, communicative and normal movement skills. The conventional imaging studies illustrate reduced brain area connectivity in people with ASD, involving selected parts of the brain cortex. People with ASD express much interest in musical activities which engages the brain network areas and improves communication and social skills.The main objective of this review is to analyze the potential role of MT in treating the neurological conditions, particularly ASD. Evidence based studies have reported the extensive therapeutic application of music on various part of the brain in a nonverbal child with autism through hearing or making music.Hence we hypothesized that MT intervention can improve the communication capacity in people with ASD, than customary neurorestoration therapy alone.', u'/manuscript/201609.0022/v1', [u'Psychiatry & Mental Health studies'], [u'Human Molecular Genetics and Stem Cell Laboratory, Department of Human Genetics & Molecular Biology, Bharathiar University, Coimbatore, 641046 Tamil Nadu, India']]
