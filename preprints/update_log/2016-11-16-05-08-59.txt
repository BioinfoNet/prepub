[u'Resveratrol Impacts SIRT1 Signaling Pathways in a Rat Model of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease', ['Xiaoli Wang', 'Ting Li', 'Ji-Hong Li', 'Shu-Ying Miao', 'Xianzhong Xiao'], u'November 15 2016', u"Oxidative stress is hypothesized to contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).The study was purposed to investigate the effects of resveratrol (trans-3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene) in a rat model with COPD on the regulation of oxidative stress via the activation of Sirtuin1 (SIRTl) and proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 coactivator-1\u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1).Thirty Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups: control group, COPD group and resveratrol intervention group. The model of COPD was established by instilling with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and challenging with cigarette smoke (CS). The pathological changes in lungs were evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) stain. The levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) in serum were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The level of malondialdehyde (MDA) and the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in both lung tissue homogenate and bronchial alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were examined by using the commercially available kits. The expression levels of SIRT1 and PGC-1\u03b1 in the lung tissues were examined by immunohistochemistry as well as real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR) and western blotting analysis. After the treatment with resveratrol (50mg/kg), compared with the COPD group, the alleviation of inflammation and the reconstruction in the small airways of lungs were seen, which might be correlated not only with the lower level of MDA and the higher activity of SOD, but also with the upregulation of SIRT1 and PGC-1\u03b1 expression. Resveratrol treatment also decreased serum levels of IL-6 and IL-8. The results indicated that resveratrol appeared to reduce oxidative stress by altering the levels of MDA and SOD in our rat COPD model, and the possible mechanism of this intervention effect of resveratrol with COPD may be associated with its upregulation of SIRT1and PGC-1\u03b1.Thus resveratrol might be a therapeutic modality in COPD.", u'/manuscript/201611.0076/v1', [u'Pharmacology & Toxicology'], [u'Department of Pathophysiology, Xiangya School of Medicine, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410000, China', u'Medical College of Jishou University, Jishou, Hunan 416000, China']]
