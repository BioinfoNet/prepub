[u'Cytotoxic Activity of Vernonia mespilifolia Less Used in the Folk Medicine in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa', ['Jeremiah Oshiomame Unuofin', 'Gloria Aderonke Otunola', 'Anthony Jide Afolayan'], u'September 2 2016', u'Vernonia mespilifolia is widely used in folk medicine in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. The aim of this study was to evaluate the biological activity of the acetone, aqueous and ethanol extracts of Vernonia mespilifolia using brine shrimp hatchability and lethality assay. The result showed hatching success in this order: aqueous extract (48.6%) > acetone extract (38.2%) > ethanol extract (26.8%). The LC50 of the lethality assay were in this order: acetone extract (67.8 \xb5g/mL) > aqueous extract (132 \xb5g/mL) > ethanol extract (383 \xb5g/mL). According to Meyer\u2019s toxicity index (using brine shrimps), LC50 < 1000 \xb5g/ mL is toxic. Therefore, the results of the three solvent extracts could be said to be toxic as do have LC50 < 1000 \xb5g/ mL. However, the toxicity of the crude extracts could suggest or confer some antitumor properties, hence further in vitro, in vivo and antitumour assays are recommended to further substantiate these claims.', u'/manuscript/201609.0006/v1', [u'Pharmacology & Toxicology'], [u'Medicinal Plants and Economic Development (MPED) Research Centre, Department of Botany, University of Fort Hare, Alice 5700, South Africa']]
