[u'Fundamental Elucidation of HLA in Type 1 Diabetes of Arab Populations', ['Mohamed Mirza Jahromi'], u'September 7 2016', u'Aims/Hypothesis): Type 1 diabetes is an immune-mediated disease with destruction of the pancreatic \u03b2-cells, a process that is conditioned by multiple genes and other factors. HLA counts as the major susceptibility gene. Significant variations in HLA genetic susceptibility to type 1 diabetes between Caucasians, African and Asian and other ethnic groups may have led to the variation in incidence of type 1 diabetes globally. Type 1 diabetes is characterized upon HLA identification. In this chapter we discuss global variations in genetic susceptibility of HLA with regard to type 1 diabetes globally with a particular attention to Arab population. Methods): Haplotype configuration of HLA class I A, B, C and Class II \u2013DR/DQ/DP were studied in Caucasians, African and Asian and in Arab population to see if that is responsible for the exponential rise in the rate of type 1 diabetes. Results): Although Arabs have one of the highest global incidence and prevalence rates of type 1 diabetes, unfortunately, there is a dearth amount of information regarding HLA genetic susceptibility to type 1 diabetes in the Arab world. HLA haplotype configurations contribute to its risk value. However, out of an insufficient present study there are examples of misjudgment of HLA risk according to HLA alleles rather than haplotypes. Conclusion): To date HLA outlooks for the characterization of type 1 diabetes. There is an ethnicity difference in HLA characteristics which is responsible for variation in type 1 diabetes. Although Arab population have contributed heavily in the rise of burden of type 1 diabetes, however, there is significantly a dearth amount of studies on HLA in Arab population. Obviously, any future prediction, prevention or cure of the disease will be based on the HLA genetics. There is a dire need for a systematic screening of HLA for Arab population with type 1 diabetes, identification of Arab HLA-risk values and identify those who are prone to get the disease.', u'/manuscript/201609.0029/v1', [u'Other'], [u'Population genetics, Clinical Research Department, Clinical Division, Dasman Diabetes Institute, P.O Box 1180, Dasman 15462, Kuwait']]
[u'Identification of One BOCR Mutation and Five NF1 Mutations in Male Patients with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 and Congenital Pseudarthrosis of the Tibia', ['Zhifan Zhou', 'Yong Zeng', 'Xinchun Wu', 'Fei Li', 'Xiaoyan Liu', 'Lu Zhou', 'Lihua Hou', 'Silong Sun', 'Lu Shen', 'Zhangyuan Lin'], u'September 7 2016', u'Neurofibromatosis type1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the NF1gene. Although congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia (CPT) has frequently been associated with NF1, the underlying molecular mechanism of CPT in these NF1 patients is yet ill-understood. The aim of the present study was to detect NF1 mutations from genomic DNA and to harbor variants associated with CPT in NF1 patients. Whole-exome sequencing was first carried out with samples from two patients with CPT in one NF1 family, and a novel mutation c.2324A>G (p.E775G) in NF1 gene was identified. Additionally, a missense variant c.455C>T (p.P152L) in BCOR gene completely co-segregated with the CPT phenotype within this family. Subsequently, NF1 and NF2 genes in four other unrelated patients with both NF1 and CPT were screened using targeted sequencing. Four mutations in NF1 gene, including two known mutations (c.2288T>C/p.L763P, c.574 C>T/p.R192*) and two novel mutations (c.768delT/p.F256Lfs*25, c.2229_2230delTG/ p.V744Qfs*23) were detected. Further study confirmed that CPT was present in NF1 families, and NF1 mutations were closely associated with these complex phenotypes. Moreover, the data from the current study indicated that male gender might be a susceptibility factor for CPT in NF1. Therefore, we speculated that BCOR variants might be related to CPT phenotype among male NF1 patients.', u'/manuscript/201609.0024/v1', [u'General Medical Research'], [u'Department of Neurology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410008, China', u'Hunan Province Key Laboratory in Neurodegenerative Disorders, Central South University, Changsha 410008, China', u'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genetics, Changsha 410008, China', u'Department of Orthopaedics, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, #87 Xiangya Road, Changsha 410008, China', u'BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, 518083, China']]
