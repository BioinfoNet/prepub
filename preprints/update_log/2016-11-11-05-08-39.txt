[u'Clinical Decision-Making in the Treatment of Schizophrenia: Focus on Long-Acting Injectable Antipsychotics', ['Ludovic Samalin', 'Marion Garnier', 'Candy Auclair', 'Pierre-Michel Llorca'], u'November 10 2016', u'The purposes of this study were to identify clinician\u2019s characteristics associated with higher prescription rates of long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotics, as well as the information sources influencing medical decision-making about treatment of schizophrenia. We surveyed 202 psychiatrists during 6 regional French conferences (Bordeaux, Lyon, Marseille, Nice, Paris, Strasbourg). Data on the characteristics of practice, prescription rates of antipsychotic and information sources about their clinical decisions were collected. Most of psychiatrists used second-generation antipsychotic (SGA), and preferentially an oral formulation, in the treatment of schizophrenia. SGA LAI was prescribed to 30.4% of schizophrenic patients. The duration and the type of practice did not influence the class or formulation of antipsychotics used. The clinicians following the higher percentage of schizophrenic patients were associated with the higher use of LAI antipsychotics and the lower use of oral SGA. Personal experience, government regulatory approval and guidelines for the treatment of schizophrenia were the 3 main contributing factors guiding the clinical decision-making of clinicians about treatment of schizophrenia. The more clinicians follow schizophrenic patients, the more they use LAI antipsychotic. The development of specialised programmes with top specialists should lead to better use of LAI in the treatment of schizophrenia.', u'/manuscript/201611.0056/v1', [u'Psychiatry & Mental Health studies'], [u'CHU Clermont-Ferrand, Department of Psychiatry, University of Auvergne, EA 7280,  63000 Clermont-Ferrand, France', u'French Society for Biological Psychiatry and Neuropsychopharmacology, CH Sainte Anne,  75674 Paris, France', u'Fondation FondaMental, 94000 Cr\xe9teil, France', u'CHU Clermont-Ferrand, Department of Public Health, University of Auvergne, EA 7280,  63000 Clermont-Ferrand, France', u'Centre Hospitalier et Universitaire, Service de Psychiatrie B, 58 rue Montalembert,  63000 Clermont-Ferrand, France']]
