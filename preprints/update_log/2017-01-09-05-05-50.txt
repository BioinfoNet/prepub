[u'Surveillance of Mosquitoes for Zika Virus in Westchester County, New York', ['Randolph Schilke'], u'January 9 2017', u'Geographic expansion and potential gains in the virulence of Zika virus emerged in Brazil during 2015. In 2016, New York State issued emergency regulations after the World Health Organization declared Zika virus a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. In this study, mosquito surveillance was conducted in Westchester County, New York, to identify Zika virus and other arboviruses. Twenty trap sites were used for Aedes albopictus surveillance. Westchester County Department of Health performed testing for Zika, West Nile, and Eastern equine encephalitis viruses on 369 batches comprising 8,891 mosquitos. Aedes albopictus mosquitos were identified in Nassau, Rockland, Suffolk, Westchester, and New York City. Zika virus was not detected among mosquitos, despite the increased capacity for specimen analysis in Westchester County. Although this study provides the first evidence of appropriate Zika virus surveillance, I am currently unable to determine the potential mechanism of vector transmission for Zika virus by Aedes albopictus. Results obtained from this study will aid in the accumulation of evidence regarding the distribution, emergence, and trapping capabilities of potential Zika virus vectors; however, further studies are required in order to determine with certainty whether Zika virus is being transmitted throughout Westchester County.', u'/manuscript/201701.0041/v1', [u'Entomology'], []]
[u'Optimization of Ultrasonic-Assisted Extraction by Response Surface Methodology with Maximal Phenolic Yield and Antioxidant Activity from Acer truncatum Leaves', ['Lingguang Yang', 'Peipei Yin', 'Hang Fan', 'Qiang Xue', 'Ke Li', 'Xiang Li', 'Liwei Sun', 'Yujun Liu'], u'January 9 2017', u'This study was designed for the first time to improve phenolic yield and antioxidant activity of ultrasonic-assisted extraction from Acer truncatum leaves (ATL) using response surface methodology, and phenolic composition in ATL extracted under the optimized condition were characterized by UPLC-QTOF-MS/MS. Solvent and extraction time were selected based on preliminary experiments, and a four-factors-three-levels central composite design was conducted to optimize solvent concentration (X1), material-to-liquid ratio (X2), ultrasonic temperature (X3) and power (X4) for an optimal total phenol yield (Y1) and DPPH\u2022 antioxidant activity (Y2). The results showed that the optimal combination was ethanol: water (v:v) 66.21%, material-to-liquid ratio 1:15.31 g/mL, ultrasonic temperature 60 \xb0C, power 267.30 W, and time 30 min with three extractions, giving a maximal total phenol yield of 7593.62 mg gallic acid equivalent /100 g d.w. and a maximal DPPH\u2022 antioxidant activity of 74241.61 \u03bcmol Trolox equivalent/100 g d.w.. Furthermore, 22 phenolics were first identified in ATL extract obtained under the optimized conditions, indicating that gallates, gallotannins, quercetin, myricetin and chlorogenic acid derivatives were the main phenolic composition in ATL. What\u2019s more, a gallotannins pathway existing in ATL from gallic acid to penta-O-galloyl-glucoside was interpreted. All these results provided practical information aiming at full utilization of phenolics in ATL, together with fundamental knowledge for further research.', u'/manuscript/201701.0036/v1', [u'Plant Sciences'], []]
[u'Use of the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube Test in the Diagnosis and Monitoring of Treatment Efficacy in Active Pulmonary Tuberculosis', ['Ping-Chin Chang', 'Pin-Hui Wang', 'Kow-Tong Chen'], u'January 9 2017', u'The value of QuantiFERON in the diagnosis of tuberculosis and in the monitoring of the response to anti-tuberculosis treatment is unclear. The aims of this study were to evaluate the accuracy of the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT) test in the diagnosis of tuberculosis and in the monitoring of the response to anti-tuberculosis treatment in patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). Between January 2013 and December 2015, 128 cases with active PTB and 128 controls with no mycobacterial infection, matched by age (within 3 years) and by the week that they visited Tainan Chest Hospital, were enrolled in the study. Serial testing by QFT-GIT at baseline and after 2 and 6 months of treatment was performed. At these time points, a comparison of the performance of QFT-GIT with that of sputum culture status among study subjects was conducted. Compared to baseline, 116 (87.2%) cases showed a decreased response, whereas 17 (12.8%) showed persistent or stronger interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) responses at 2 months. Their IFN-\u03b3 responses declined significantly from baseline to 2 months (median, 6.32 vs. 4.12; P < 0.005). The sensitivity values of the QFT-GIT test for the detection of pulmonary tuberculosis at cut-off points of 0.35 IU/ml, 0.20 IU/ml, and 0.10 IU/ml were 74.4%, 78.2%, and 80.5%, respectively. The specificity values at cut-off points of 0.35 IU/ml, 0.20 IU/ml, and 0.10 IU/ml were 66.2%, 63.9%, and 57.1%, respectively. Our results support the QFT-GIT assay as a potential tool for diagnosing tuberculosis and for monitoring the efficacy of anti-tuberculosis treatment.', u'/manuscript/201701.0035/v1', [u'Other'], []]
[u'Sarcocystis neurona Protein Kinases: Computational Identification, Evolutionary Analysis and Putative Inhibitor Docking', ['Edwin Kimathi Murungi', 'Henry Muriuki Kariithi'], u'January 9 2017', u'The apicomplexan parasite, Sarcocystis neurona causes the degenerative neurological equine protozoal myeloencephalitis (EPM) disease of horses. Due to its host range expansion, S. neurona is an emerging threat that requires close monitoring. In apicomplexans, protein kinases (PKs) have been implicated in a myriad of critical functions such as host cell invasion, cell cycle progression and host immune responses evasion. Here, we used various bioinformatics methods to define the kinome of S.\xa0neurona and phylogenetic relatedness of its PKs to other apicomplexans. Further, three-dimensional (3D) homology models for selected S. neurona putative PKs were constructed and evaluated for inhibitor docking. We identified 92 putative PKs clustering within the AGC, CAMK, CK1, CMGC, STE, TKL, aPK and OPK groups. Although containing the universally conserved PKA (AGC group), S. neurona kinome was devoid of PKB and PKC, but contained the six apicomplexan conserved CDPKs (CAMK group). The OPK group was represented by ROPKs 19A, 27, 30, 33, 35 and 37, but was devoid of the virulence-associated ROPKs 5, 6, 18 and 38. Two out of the three S. neurona CK1 enzymes had high sequence similarities to T. gondii TgCK1-\u03b1 and TgCK1-\u03b2 and the Plasmodium PfCK1. Docking of four inhibitors onto homology models of putative ROP27 and PKA indicated that inhibition of S. neurona PKs is feasible, but needs to be experimentally tested. The essentiality of apicomplexan PKs makes the elucidation of S. neurona kinome a key milestone for development of novel therapeutics for EPM.', u'/manuscript/201701.0040/v1', [u'Molecular Biology'], []]
