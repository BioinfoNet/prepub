[u'In Chronic Cardiac Decompensation with Reduced Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction, Phosphodiesterase-5 Inhibition Exerts Significant Effects on some Clinical, Functional and Hemodynamic Outcomes: a Meta-Analysis', [], u'March 22 2017', u'Background:\xa0In\xa0 patients with pulmonary arterial\xa0 hypertension, substantial\xa0 clinical benefits have been reported with the use of phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors(PDE5i) . Moreover, some studies would have proven\xa0 useful effects\xa0 of PDE5i\xa0 also\xa0 on\xa0\xa0 the clinical picture of the\xa0 pulmonary hypertension(PH) secondary to left-sided chronic heart failure(CHF). Methods:\xa0We performed a meta-analysis comprising randomized controlled trials ( RCTs) which had compared\xa0 PDE5i ( mostly sildenafil) with\xa0 placebo in CHF patients.\xa0Results:\xa014 studies, including 928\xa0 patients overall , were admitted to the\xa0 meta-analysis. In\xa0\xa0 heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction(HFREF), PDE5i,\xa0 compared to placebo, significantly improved the composite of death and hospitalization (OR= 0.28; 95% CI: 0.10 to 0.74). They also improved peak VO2\xa0 (difference in means[MD]: 3.76; 95% CI: 3.27 to 4.25), six-minutes walk distance ( (6MWD)(\xa0 MD, 22.7 meters ; 95% CI, 8.19 to 37.21) and pulmonary arterial systolic pressure (MD: -11.52 mmHg; 95% CI: -15.56 to -7.49). Conversely, in\xa0\xa0 CHF with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction ( HFpEF), PDE5i\xa0 were shown\xa0 not to yield\xa0 any\xa0 beneficial effect\xa0 concerning\xa0 the investigated endpoints.\xa0Conclusions:\xa0In HFREF, PDE5i\xa0 were shown\xa0 to improve\xa0 the composite of death and hospitalization, as well as\xa0\xa0\xa0 exercise capacity and pulmonary hemodynamics. Conversely,\xa0 in HFpEF, no significant clinical, ergospirometric or hemodynamic \xa0betterment\xa0 was achieved\xa0 using PDE5i treatment.', u'/manuscript/201703.0177/v1', [u'Cardiology'], []]
