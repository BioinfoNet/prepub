[u'Raman and Terahertz Spectroscopic Investigation of Cocrystal Formation Involving Antibiotic Nitrofurantoin Drug and Coformer 4-aminobenzoic Acid', ['Yong Du', 'Qiang Cai', 'Jiadan Xue', 'Qi Zhang'], u'November 1 2016', u'Cocrystallizaiton could improve most physicochemical properties of specific active pharmaceutical ingredients, which has great potential in pharmaceutical development. In this study, the cocrystal of nitrofurantoin and 4-aminobenzoic acid was prepared with solid-state (solvent-free or green-chemistry) grinding approach, and the above cocrystal has been characterized by Raman and terahertz vibrational spectroscopic techniques. Spectral results show that the vibrational modes of the cocrystal within the whole spectral region are different from those of the corresponding parent materials. The dynamic process of such pharmaceutical cocrystal formation has also been monitored directly with Raman spectra. These results offer us unique means for characterizing the cocrystal conformation from molecule-level and also provide us rich information about the reaction dynamic of cocrystal formation within pharmaceutical fields.', u'/manuscript/201611.0008/v1', [u'General Medical Research'], [u'Centre for THz Research, China Jiliang University, Hangzhou 310018, China', u'Department of Chemisty, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, Hangzhou 310018, China']]
[u'Reshuffling the Risk Factors of Severe Early Childhood Caries', ['Noha Kabil', 'Sherif Eltaweil'], u'November 1 2016', u'Severe early childhood caries remains the most common chronic disease affecting children. .Its multifactorial etiology lead to the controversy about which risk factors were more significant to its development. Therefore our study aimed through meticulous statistical analysis to arrange the \u201cwell agreed upon\u201d common risk factors in order of significance to aid the clinician in tailoring an adequate preventive program for this affected age group. The study concluded that the risk factors contributing to severe early childhood caries in order of their significance were Night feeding, On demand feeding, Mother\u2019s Employment, Mother\u2019s caries Experience, Starting age of brushing, Mother\u2019s education, Sharing utensils, Child\u2019s first dental visit, Number of siblings, Brushing frequency, Sweetened food and beverage consumption, Sweetened beverages, and at last the snacking frequency.', u'/manuscript/201611.0005/v1', [u'Dentistry'], [u'Department of Pediatric Dentistry and Dental Public Health, Faculty of Dentistry,  Ain Shams University, Cairo 11566, Egypt', u'Department of Pediatric Dentistry and Dental Public Health, Faculty of Oral & Dental Medicine,  Cairo University, Giza 12613, Egypt']]
