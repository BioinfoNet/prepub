[u'Ethnic Differences in the Food Intake Patterns and Its Association Factors of Adolescents in Malaysia', ['Nurul-Fadhilah Abdullah', 'Pey Sze Teo', 'Leng Huat Foo'], u'September 5 2016', u'Abstract: Objective: The aim of the study was to identify dietary patterns and its association with socio-economic, dietary and lifestyle practices among adolescents in Malaysia. Methods: A validated food frequency questionnaire was used to assess dietary patterns. Results: Multivariate analyses show that age and physical activity (PA) levels were emerged as positive determinants of healthy-based food pattern in Malay (All, p<0.001), whereas higher consumption of eating-out from home (EatOut) and fast food (All, p<0.05) were negative determinants. High weekly breakfast skipping (p<0.001) and EatOut (p<0.01) were positively associated with a western-based pattern, whereas age (p<0.001) and household income (p<0.05) were negative determinants. Higher frequency of daily snacking (p<0.05) was emerged as positive determinant of local-based food pattern. For Chinese adolescents, age (p<0.001), PA levels (p<0.001) and maternal education level (p<0.05) emerged as positive determinants for the healthy-based pattern, whereas high EatOut and fast food intakes (All, p<0.01) were negative determinants. Higher weekly consumption of EatOut (p<0.01), fast food (p<0.05) and carbonated beverages (p<0.05), and daily snacking practice (p<0.01) were positively associated with higher western-based food pattern, whereas age (p<0.01) was inversely associated. Conclusion: These findings suggest that unhealthy dietary and lifestyle practices could increase the risk of adherence to unhealthy western-based food pattern that is high in fat, sugar and salt contents, and consequently increase the risk of developing obesity and metabolic-related disorders during these critical years of growth.', u'/manuscript/201609.0019/v1', [u'Nutrition'], [u'Programme of Nutrition, School of Health Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Health Campus, Kubang Kerian 16150, Kelantan, Malaysia', u'Department of Health Science, Faculty of Sport Science and Coaching, Universiti Pendidikan Sultan Idris, Proton City, Tanjung Malim 35900, Perak, Malaysia', u"School of Biosciences, Taylor's University lakeside campus, 47500 Subang Jaya, Selangor, Malaysia"]]
[u'Anticancer and Antioxidant Activities of Some Algae from Western Libyan Coast', ['Rabia Alghazeer', 'Mahboba Enaeli', 'Nazlin K. Howell'], u'September 5 2016', u'Seaweeds are considered as one of the largest biomass producers in marine environment that is rich in bioactive metabolites and a source of natural ingredients for functional foods. The potential antioxidant activity and the potential inhibition of Caco2 cell proliferation, of crude extracts of: Chlorophyta (Ulva lactuca, and Codium tomentosum), Phaeophyta (Cystoseira crinita, Cystoseira stricta, and Sargassum vulgare), and Rhodophyta (Gelidium latifolium, Hypnea musciformis, and Jania rubens) collected from western Libyan coast were evaluated in vitro. The antioxidant activity was determined by reducing power and DPPH assays while cell proliferation, morphological changes and the cell cycle arrest were assessed by MTT, inverted light microscope and flow cytometry methods respectively. The polyphenols and flavonoids rich extracts showed remarkable reducing power and antiradical properties. After exposure of Caco2 cells to; various concentrations of extracts (50, 100,150 and 200 \xb5g/mL) especially from brown algae for 72 h, significantly reduced cell proliferation. The antiproliferative effect of algae extracts was correlated with their polyphenol and flavonoid contents. Cell cycle analysis further showed that cells were arrested in G phases along with an increment in sub-diploidal cell population (sub-G) after extract application. These results imply that seaweeds which are rich in bioactive compounds may be in anticancer drug research programs. However, further investigations are essential to reveal the molecular mechanisms of the anticancer activities of these algae.', u'/manuscript/201609.0018/v1', [u'Pharmacology & Toxicology'], [u'Chemistry Department, Faculty of Sciences, University of Tripoli, Tripoli, Libya', u'Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, United Kingdom GU2 7XH']]
[u'Decreasing Trends in HIV Testing among Adults in Georgia: Analysis of the 2010-2014 BRFSS Data', ['Benjamin E. Ansa', 'Sashia White', 'Yunmi Chung', 'Selina A. Smith'], u'September 5 2016', u'Georgia is ranked fifth highest among states for rates of HIV diagnosis. About 4% of persons living with HIV infection in the United States reside in Georgia, and almost 19% of these people do not know their HIV status. The present study examined the trends and associated factors of HIV testing among adults in Georgia between 2010 and 2014 by analyzing data of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). A total of 30,791 persons aged \u226518 years were identified who responded to the question \u201cHave you ever been tested for HIV?\u201d Overall, there were 11,543 respondents who had been tested for HIV, with a decrease in percentage from 49.4% in 2010 to 43.7% in 2014 (p<0.001). Factors associated with HIV testing were being black (p<0.001), being younger than 55 years (p<0.001), single (p=0.02), attaining education level above high school (P<0.001), engaging in HIV high-risk behaviors (p<0.001), and not having healthcare coverage (p=0.03). Overall in Georgia, there has been a decline in the temporal trend of HIV testing, and more than half of adults have never been tested for HIV. For reducing HIV transmission in Georgia, enhancing access and utilization of HIV testing should be a public health priority.', u'/manuscript/201609.0014/v1', [u'Other'], [u'Institute of Public & Preventive Health, Augusta University, CJ-2300 1120 15th Street, Augusta, GA 30912, USA', u'Medical College of Georgia, Augusta University, 1120 15th Street, Augusta, GA 30912, USA', u'Department of Family Medicine, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta, GA 30912, USA']]

TPS is a group of hetero-polysaccharides bounded with proteins. There were tests showing that TPS had various bioactivities, such as antioxidant, antitumors, antihyperglycemia, anti-inflammation and improving immunity. However, inconsistent results concerning chemical composition and bioactivity of TPS were published in recent years. The advances in chemical composition and bioactivities of TPS were reviewed in the present paper. The inconsistent and controversial results regarding composition and bioactivities of TPS were also discussed.', u'/manuscript/201609.0013/v1', [u'General Medical Research'], [u'Tea Research Institute, Zhejiang University, # 866 Yuhangtang Road, Hangzhou 310058, China', u'National Tea and Tea product Quality Supervision and Inspection Center (Guizhou), Zunyi 563100, China']]
