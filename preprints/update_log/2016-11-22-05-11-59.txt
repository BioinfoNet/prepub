[u'Inhibition of Autophagy by Deguelin Sensitizes Pancreatic Cancer Cells to Doxorubicin', ['Xiao-Dong Xu', 'Yan Zhao', 'Min Zhang', 'Rui-Zhi He', 'Xiu-Hui Shi', 'Xing-Jun Guo', 'Cheng-Jian Shi', 'Feng Peng', 'Min Wang', 'Min Shen', 'Xin Wang', 'Xu Li', 'Ren-Yi Qin'], u'November 21 2016', u'Pancreatic cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Furthermore, patients with pancreatic cancer experience limited benefit from current chemotherapeutic approaches because of drug resistance. Therefore, an effective therapeutic strategy for patients with pancreatic cancer is urgently required. Deguelin is a natural chemopreventive drug that exerts potent antiproliferative activity in solid tumors by inducing cell death. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this activity have not been fully elucidated. Here we show that deguelin blocks autophagy and induces apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells in vitro. Autophagy induced by doxorubicin plays a protective role in pancreatic cancer cells, and suppressing autophagy by chloroquine or silencing autophagy protein 5 enhanced doxorubicin-induced cell death. Similarly, inhibition of autophagy by deguelin also chemosensitized pancreatic cancer cell lines to doxorubicin. These findings suggest that deguelin has potent anticancer effects against pancreatic cancer and potentiates the anti-cancer effects of doxorubicin. These findings provide evidence that combined treatment with deguelin and doxorubicin represents an effective strategy for treating pancreatic cancer.', u'/manuscript/201611.0107/v1', [u'Gastroenterology'], [u'Department of Biliary-Pancreatic Surgery, Affiliated Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College,  Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430074, China']]
[u'Comparison of Two EpCAM-Based Methods for CTC Detection and Molecular Characterization in Advanced Colorectal Cancer', ['Santiago Cabezas-Camarero', 'Virginia De La Orden', 'Silvia Veganzones-De-Castro', 'Beatriz Medievo-Valeros', 'Manuel Enrique Fuentes-Ferrer', 'Antonio Sanchez-Ruiz', 'Mariano Provencio', 'Enrique Aranda', 'Javier Sastre', 'Eduardo Diaz-Rubio'], u'November 21 2016', u'Circulating tumor cells (CTC) have shown to be prognostic in advanced colorectal cancer (advCRC), but their value for predicting response to treatment or as a source of molecular data is debated. We compared CellSearch\xae (Janssen Diagnostics, LLC) and IsoFluxTM (Fluxion Biosciences Inc, South San Francisco, CA) systems for the enumeration of CTC in patients with newly diagnosed advCRC (group 1; n=34). Using castPCRTM we studied KRAS status in CTC isolated with IsoFluxTM and compared it with that of the primary tumor in patients from group 1 and in KRAS wild-type (KRASWT) patients with progressive disease (group 2; n=22). Median number of CTC detected with CellSearch\xae (groups 1 and 2) was 1 (range: 0-78) and with IsoFluxTM (group 1) was 8 (range: 0-419), showing a modest correlation (r=0.345, P=0.036), which improved if lung metastases (r=0.805, P=0.016) or if lung and liver metastases were present (r=0.812, P=0.05). A Bland-Altman plot showed that the higher the number of CTC detected the larger the difference between both methods in favor of IsoFluxTM. After a median follow-up since CTC collection of 16 months (range: 1-30) CellSearch\xae\xa0\u2265 3 CTC (HR 2.77, 95% CI 0.77-9.95) and IsoFluxTM\xa0\u2265 11 CTC (HR 4.14, 95% CI 1.05-16.19) were established as the best cutoff points for predicting survival. Using castPCRTM we found KRAS mutations in CTC in 4 out of 8 patients from group 1 and in 2 out of 3 patients from group 2. None of these mutations were found in the primary tumor using standard methods, possibly reflecting intratumor heterogeneity or treatment selection pressure. We conclude that IsoFluxTM is more efficient than CellSearch\xae in the isolation of CTC in patients with advCRC, achieving, in a majority of cases, the established minimum of CTC for castPCRTM-based genetic analyses.', u'/manuscript/201611.0105/v1', [u'Oncology & Oncogenics'], [u'Medical Oncology Department, Instituto de Investigaci\xf3n Sanitaria San Carlos (IdISSC), Hospital Cl\xednico Universitario San Carlos, Centre afilliated to Red de Centros CIBER, 28040 Madrid, Spain', u'CTC Unit, Hospital Cl\xednico Universitario San Carlos, 28040 Madrid, Spain', u'UGC de Medicina Preventiva, Hospital Cl\xednico San Carlos, Instituto de Investigaci\xf3n Sanitaria del Hospital Cl\xednico San Carlos (IdISSC), 28040 Madrid, Spain', u'Medical Oncology Department, Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro-Majadahonda, IDIPHIM, Universidad Aut\xf3noma de Madrid, 28049 Madrid, Spain', u'Medical Oncology Department, IMIBIC, Hospital Universitario Reina Sof\xeda, C\xf3rdoba, University of C\xf3rdoba, RETICC, 14002 C\xf3rdoba, Spain']]
[u'Myocardial Infarction Promoted the Contrast-Induced Nephropathy by Renal Injury', ['Zhiwen Tao', 'Ningtian Zhou', 'Fan Huang', 'Bo Chen', 'Zhijian Yang'], u'November 21 2016', u'Background: The morbidity of myocardial infarction is keeping raise in this decade. Because of high safety and operability , percutaneous coronary intervention(PCI) has been used to conquer this disease for more than 20 years.An important complication of PCI is contrast induced nephropathy(CIN), which raises our attention. Previously, we started a study to explore the correlation between acute kidney injury and myonecrosis after scheduled percutaneous coronary intervention. Our study showed that the rate of CI-AKI in patients with post-procedural myocardial injury and undergoing elective PCI was higher than that in patients free of injury. Methods: In this study,forty male rats were randomly divided into four groups: control group (n=8), CM group (n=12), AMI group (n=8) and AMI+CM group (n=12), then velocity of renal artery blood flow (VRABF), computer tomography (CT), serum creatinine(Scr), reactive oxidative species (ROS), periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and TUNEL were used to estimate the injury of kidney. We analyzed 327 non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome subjects undertaking elective PCI. Serum levels of creatinine (SCr) and the eGFR before coronary angiography, and 24\u201372 h after contrast administration were recorded to assess the renal function. Results: The data showed that VRABF was lower in AMI+CM group than CM group from 0 minute to 24h and CT number in cortex was higher in AMI+CM group than CM group at 4-hour. As well as the level of Scr in AMI+CM group displayed a significantly increase at 24-hour compared with CM group. The histopathologic scores and percentage of tubular cell apoptosis were higher in AMI+CM group at 24-hour. In 327 patients, we found that CI-AKI occurred more often in subjects with post-procedural myonecrosis (PMN) than in those without PMN (20.8% versus 5.8%, respectively, P=0.001). Conclusion: Compared to the elective patient, the injury of CIN exhibited a higher severity in AMI patient.', u'/manuscript/201611.0108/v1', [u'Molecular Biology'], [u'Department of Cardiology,Sir RunRun Hospital of Nanjing Medical University', u'Department of Cardiology, The First Af\ufb01liated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University']]
