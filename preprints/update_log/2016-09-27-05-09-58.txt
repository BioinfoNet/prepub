[u'Destabilization Mechanism of Ionic Surfactant on Curcumin Nanocrystal against Electrolyte', ['Heni Rachmawati'], u'September 26 2016', u'We have successfully developed curcumin nanosuspension aimed for oral delivery. The main purpose is to improve bioavailability through enhancing its solubility. The nanoparticles were stabilized using various stabilizers including polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), sodium carboxymethylcellulose (Na-CMC), d-alpha tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS), and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The average diameter of particles, microscopic appearance, and sedimentation of each preparation was observed and compared. Each stabilizer demonstrated different degree of inhibition of particle aggregation under electrolyte-containing simulated gastrointestinal (GIT) fluid. Non-ionic stabilizers (PVA, PVP, and TPGS) has shown to preserve the nanosuspension stability against electrolytes. In contrast, strong ionic surfactants such as SDS were found to be very sensitive to electrolytes. The results can provide useful information for the formulators to choose the most suitable stabilizers by considering the nature of stabilizers and physiological characteristics of target site of the drug.', u'/manuscript/201609.0094/v1', [u'Other'], [u'Pharmaceutics Research Group, School of Pharmacy, Bandung Institute of Technology,  Bandung 40132, Indonesia', u'Research Center for Nanosciences and Nanotechnology, Bandung Institute of Technology,  Bandung 40132, Indonesia', u'Biopharmaceutics & NutriCosmetics, Pharmaceutical Technology, Department of Pharmacy,  Freie Universit\xe4t Berlin, Berlin 14195, Germany']]
[u'Efficacy and Safety of Eribulin in Taxane-Refractory Patients in the \u201cReal World\u201d', ['Vito Lorusso', 'Saverio Cinieri', 'Agnese Latorre', 'Luca Porcu', 'Lucia Del Mastro', 'Fabio Puglisi', 'Sandro Barni'], u'September 26 2016', u'Taxanes have been shown to be the most effective treatment for recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. However, for patients pretreated with taxanes, more active and possibly less toxic drugs are needed. In this retrospective study, we investigated on the effectiveness and safety of eribulin mesylate in 91 taxane-refractory subjects, extracted from the ESEMPIO database, which included 497 metastatic breast cancer patients treated with eribulin allover the Italy. This analysis included only those patients who have shown disease progression while receiving taxane therapy (primary refractory), or those who achieved a response followed by progression while still on therapy (taxane failure). Overall, 41/91 patients (45.2%) showed a clinical benefit; 1 complete response (2.2%) and 16 partial responses (17.6%) were observed. The median progression free survival was 3.1 months (95% CI: 2.8\u20133.5) and the median overall survival was 11.6 months (95% CI: 8.7\u201316.7). With regard to toxicity, 53 patients (58%) experienced asthenia/fatigue, 23 (25%) showed peripheral neurotoxicity, 18 (20%) alopecia, 12 (13%) mild constipation and 27 (30%) neutropenia. The toxicity related to the treatment led to eribulin dose reduction in 19 (21%) and discontinuation in 9 (10%) patients, respectively. In conclusion, this study suggests that eribulin is effective and well tolerated also in taxane-refractory patient.', u'/manuscript/201609.0093/v1', [u'Oncology & Oncogenics'], [u'Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II IRCCS, Bari 70124, Italy', u'Ospedale A.

[u'A Review of the 3D Designing of Scaffolds for Tissue Engineering with a Focus on Keratin Protein', ['Aarti Baliga', 'Shashikant Borkar'], u'September 26 2016', u'In tissue engineering scaffolds take the place of the natural extra cellular matrix (ECM). The natural ECM is the extracellular part of animal tissue that usually provides structural support to the animal cells in addition to performing various other important functions. The design aspect along with the choice of the material for the artificial scaffold is very crucial to cell differentiation, adhesion, proliferation, and the transport of the growth factors or other bio molecular signals. In addition to the material and design of the scaffolds, it is necessary to replicate the normal physiological situation if the scaffold has to function as an implant. The cells have to be located in the porous scaffold to form a three dimensional assembly. The article discusses the important factors to be considered while designing a scaffold for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.', u'/manuscript/201609.0091/v1', [u'Biotechnology'], [u'Textile Manufactures Department, Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute (VJTI), Matunga,  Mumbai 400019, India']]
