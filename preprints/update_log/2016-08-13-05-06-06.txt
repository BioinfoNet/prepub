[u'Calorie Restriction Supplemented with Fish Oil Ameliorates Abnormal Metabolic Status in Middle-Aged Obese Women: An Open-Label, Parallel-Arm, Controlled Trial', ['Fasty Arum Utami', 'Hsiu-Chuan Lee', 'Chien-Tien Su', 'Shih-Yi Huang'], u'August 13 2016', u'The increasing prevalence of obesity and sedentary lifestyles has led to an increased incidence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) worldwide. In Taiwan, middle-aged women are at a greater risk of MetS, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease than men are because they have more subcutaneous fat and larger waist circumferences compared to men with equal visceral fat levels. This study investigated the effects of calorie restriction supplemented with fish oil (CRF) in middle-aged women with MetS. For 12 weeks, 75 eligible participants were randomly assigned either calorie restriction (CR) or CRF. Both dietary intervention groups were further divided into two age groups: \u226445 and >45 years. The changes in MetS severity, inflammatory status, iron status, and red blood cell fatty acid profile were evaluated. Seventy-one participants completed the trial. Both dietary interventions significantly ameliorated MetS and improved the participants\u2019 inflammatory status. CR significantly increased total iron binding capacity, whereas CRF increased hepcidin levels. Furthermore, CRF significantly increased the n-6/n-3 and arachidonic acid/docosahexaenoic acid ratios. In conclusion, CR and CRF improved the anthropometric and MetS characteristics of early-middle aged women, including body weight, blood glucose levels, triglyceride levels, as well as the scores for the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance and quantitative insulin sensitivity cheque index. Dietary intervention was more effective in >45-year-old women than \u226445-year-old women.', u'/manuscript/201608.0133/v1', [u'Nutrition'], [u'School of Nutrition and Health Sciences, Taipei Medical University, 250 Wu-Xing Street, Taipei 110, Taiwan', u'School of Public Health, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 110, Taiwan', u'Graduate Institute of Metabolism and Obesity Science, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 110, Taiwan']]
[u'Quality of Life and Poor Oral Health: A Comparison of Postmenopausal Women', ['Kristin A. Williams', 'Hebba Shamia', 'Christine DeBaz', 'Leena Palomo'], u'August 13 2016', u'Interrelationships between traditional dental variables are becoming more evident in far reaching aspects of life such as psychosocial interaction, self-esteem, overall health and even occupational performance.  This study compares quality of life (QoL) in postmenopausal women (PMW) with poor oral health (POH) with QoL in PMW with good oral health. \r\n200 randomly recruited PMW received a dental evaluation and completed Utian Quality of Life Survey.  The participants were divided into POH and healthy groups based on dental exam.  Mean scores were calculated for each QoL item, domain and the overall summary score. For each of the four parameters for periodontitis diagnosis, periodontitis patients\u2019 QoL outcomes were compared to those of healthy patients using T-test with threshold of significance at p<0.05. QoL in all fields measured were significantly poorer in the POH compared to the healthy patients, occupational (19.95\xb15.35vs. 27.56\xb16.13), health (18.02\xb18.23 vs. 26.59 \xb16.45), emotional (15.68\xb110.22vs. 21.15\xb19.15), sexual (6.2\xb15.98vs. 10.02\xb15.35), and total score (60.21\xb125.85 vs. 84.26\xb122.35). This study finds that PMW with POH, report significantly poorer quality of life. Clinicians caring for PMW should be aware of that oral health impacts QoL and make appropriate referral decisions for patients\u2019 dental care. \r\n\r\nKeywords: Quality of Life, Oral Health, Post-menopause, \r\n                  Women', u'/manuscript/201608.0122/v1', [u'Other'], [u'Department of Community Dentistry, School of Dental Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, 2124 Cornell Road, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA', u'Department of Periodontics, School of Dental Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, 2124 Cornell Road, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA']]
[u'Case-Based Study of Metrics Derived from Instrumented Fall Risk Assessment Tests', ['Anabela Martins', 'Joana Silva', 'Antonio Santos', 'Joao Madureira', 'Carlos Alcobia', 'Luis Ferreira', 'Pedro Mendes', 'Claudia Tonelo', 'Catarina Silva', 'Daniela Baltazar', 'Ines Sousa'], u'August 12 2016', u'Purpose: National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has recently published quality standards for assessment of fall risk and preventing further falls. According to the standards, multifactorial fall risk assessments should include: identification of falls history\u037e analysis of gait, balance, mobility and muscle strength, among other factors. Despite being based on subjective analysis or simple timing and not being multifactorial, physiotherapists and physicians quite often use these tests as reference scales to differentiate between lower and higher risk of falling. Instrumented TUG has been recently reported to provide important additional information to the overall score. Objective: To explore a case-based approach of fall risk assessment to identify the most relevant and informative risk factors that in combination could better define a person risk profile. Materials and Methods: A multifactorial assessment of fall risk through questionnaires, standard functional tests, tests instrumented with inertial sensors, and force platforms has been studied within a group aged 55-80 years old. Different fall risk factors and fall risk assessment methods were analyzed in a case-based descriptive study. Results & Discussion: Subjects at higher risk of falling were identified based on their detailed profiles. A set of features were obtained from the instrumented standard tests differing significantly between subjects presenting higher or lower fall risk. Therefore, instrumenting conventional tests with wearables containing inertial sensors and force platforms gives more detailed and quantitative insights. This information can be used to better define and tailor fall prevention exercises and to improve the follow-up of the evolution of the subject.', u'/manuscript/201608.0132/v1', [u'General Medical Research'], [u'ESTeSC Coimbra Health School, Physiotherapy Department, Coimbra 3046-854, Portugal', u'Fraunhofer Portugal AICOS, Porto 4200-135, Portugal', u'Sensing Future Technologies, Coimbra 3030-199, Portugal']]
