[u'Predictors of Survival in Children with Ependymoma from a Single Center: Using Random Survival Forests', ['Francisco H. C. Felix', 'Juvenia B. Fontenele'], u'November 3 2016', u'Ependymoma is responsible for 8\u201310% of all pediatric brain tumors and constitutes the third most common brain tumor in children. No robust molecular markers are yet in routine clinical use. Surgical resection and adjuvant radiotherapy cure approximately 40-70% of pediatric patients with ependymoma. In our centre, we have been using prophylactic valproic acid treatment for brain tumor patients. Initial observations indicated that valproate could have a beneficial effect in the survival of patients. Recent observations by other authors have shown that patients with glioblastoma benefited from the treatment with valproic acid, a histone deacetylase inhibitor. We have used random survival forest, a novel ensemble survival modelling method to study a single- center, small number cohort of pediatric patients with ependymoma. This analysis has confirmed surgery resection extent and treatment with radiotherapy as independent predictors of overall survival. Treatment with valproic acid was also a predictor of higher survival in this cohort. These results highlight the potential usefullness of the random survival forest model in gathering information from retrospective data. More data is needed about the possible influence of histone deacetylase inhibition by valproic acid in the survival of patients with ependymoma.

[u'Vitamin C Supplementation and Hyperuricemia: Fact or Hoax?', ['Firas S. Azzeh', 'Abrar H. Al-Hebshi', 'Haya D. Al-Essimii', 'Mohammed A. Alarjah'], u'November 3 2016', u'Abstract: Hyperuricemia is commonly diagnosed in subjects with abnormal purine metabolism. Prolonged hyperuricemia often associated with gout, which is a vital risk factor for joint dysfunction. The current study was designed to determine the efficacy of vitamin C supplements for treatment of high serum uric acid (UA) among hyperuricemic and gouty patients, and finding-out the effect of supplementation on serum creatinine (Cr) level and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). This intervention study was started in April, 2013, till two months. A convenient sample of 30 adults aged between 24-75 years of both genders was assigned into two study groups: hyperuricemic (n=15) and gouty (n=15) groups. Each participant supplemented with 500 mg/day vitamin C chewable tablets for 2 months. Serum UA, Cr, and GFR were measured before and after treatment. At the end of this study, Cr and GFR enhanced insignificantly in both groups. UA increased insignificantly in gouty group after 2 months by about 0.31 mg/dl. On the other hand, hyperuricemic group showed significant (P \u22640.05) decrease in UA (-0.78 mg/dl) after 2 months duration. In conclusion, supplementation with 500 mg/day vitamin C for 2 months significantly attenuated serum UA for hyperuricemic patients and insignificantly affected serum UA in gouty patients. The uselessness of vitamin C supplements on gouty patients could be associated to a number of possible reasons.', u'/manuscript/201611.0027/v1', [u'Nutrition'], [u'Department of Clinical Nutrition, Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, Umm Al-Qura University, P.O.

[u'From Systems to Organisations', ['Mauricio Kritz'], u'November 3 2016', u'Warren Weaver, writing about the function that science should have in mankind\u2019s developing future, ideas and ideals, proposed to classify scientific problems into \u2018problems of simplicity\u2019, \u2018problems of disorganised complexity\u2019, and \u2018problems of organised complexity\u2019 \u2014 the huge complementary class to which all biological, human, and social problems belong. Problems of simplicity have few components and variables and have been extensively addressed in the last 400 years. Problems of disorganised complexity have a huge number of individually erratic components and variables, but possess collective regularities that can be analysed by resourcing to stochastic methods. Yet, problems of organised complexity do not yield easily to classical or statistical treatment since interrelations among phenomenon elements change during its evolution alongside commonly used state variables, affecting behaviour and outcome. Moreover, organisation, the focal point in this complementary class, is still an elusive concept despite the gigantic efforts undertaken since a century ago to tame it. This paper addresses the description, representation and study of phenomena in the \u2018problems of organised complexity\u2019 class. Grounded on relational mathematical constructs, a theoretical framework providing operational definitions and schemes for formally modelling organisations and interaction of organisations is introduced. This framework extends the general systems\u2019 concept and provides a novel perspective for addressing organised complexity phenomena as a collection of interacting organisations.', u'/manuscript/201611.0026/v1', [u'Other'], [u'National Laboratory for Scientific Computation, Av.

Their structures were established by means of spectroscopic analysis and comparison with published data. Compounds 1-5 were tested in vitro for activity against three pathogenic yeast isolates, Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis and Candida krusei. The activity of compounds 1, 2 and 4 were comparable to that of the reference compound fluconazole (MIC values below 32 \xb5g/ml) against the three tested yeast isolates. They were also tested for inhibitory properties against four enzymes of metabolic significance: Glucose-6-Phosphate Deshydrogenase (G6PD), human erythrocyte Carbonic anhydrase I and II (hCA I and hCA II), Glutathione S-transferase (GST). Compound 4 showed highly potent inhibitory property against the four tested enzymes with overall IC50 values below 4 \xb5M and inhibitory constant (Ki) <3 \xb5M.', u'/manuscript/201611.0023/v1', [u'Other'], [u'Laboratory of Natural Products and Organic Synthesis, Department of Organic Chemistry,  Faculty of Science, University of Yaound\xe9 1, Box: 812, Yaound\xe9, Cameroon', u'Antimicrobial & Biocontrol Agents Unit, Laboratory for Phytobiochemistry and Medicinal Plants Studies, Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Yaound\xe9 I,  Yaound\xe9 P.O.
