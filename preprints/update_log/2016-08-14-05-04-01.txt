[u'Vorinostat Pretreatment Enhanced Ciprofloxacin-Induced Antibacterial Activity', ['Majed M. Masadeh', 'Karem H. Alzoubi', 'Sayer I. Al-azzam', 'Ahlam M. Al-buhairan'], u'August 13 2016', u'The mechanism of ciprofloxacin action involves interference with transcription and replication of bacterial DNA, which results in elevated oxidative stress, and bacterial cell death. Vorinostat was shown to induce oxidative DNA damage. In the current work, the possibility for interactive effect of vorinotat on ciprofloxacin-induced cytotoxicity against a number of reference bacteria was investigated. Standard bacterial strains were Escherichia coli ATCC 35218, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC29213, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 17978, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 12459, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 13883, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (ATCC 43300), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (ATCC 25923). The antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin with or without pretreatment of bacterial cells by vorinostat was examined using disc diffusion procedure and determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and zones of inhibition of bacterial growth. All tested bacterial strains showed sensitivity to ciprofloxacin. When pretreated with vorinostat, significantly larger zones of inhibition and smaller MIC values were observed in all bacterial strains compared ciprofloxacin alone. As a conclusion, current results showed the possible agonistic properties for vorinostat when it is used together with ciprofloxacin. Future research will be focus on molecular mechanisms possible for such interactive effect.', u'/manuscript/201608.0141/v1', [u'Other'], [u'Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, Jordan University of Science and Technology, Irbid 22110, Jordan', u'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Jordan University of Science and Technology, Irbid 22110, Jordan', u'College of applied Medical Sciences, King Saud University, Riyadh 12372, Saudi Arabia']]
