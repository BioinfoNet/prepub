[u'Enhanced Plant Performance in Cicer arietinum L. due to the Addition of Combination of Plant Growth Promoting Bacteria', ['Maria Perez-Fernandez', 'Valentine Alexander'], u'March 2 2017', u'Six bacterial strains with differing abilities to produce varying concentrations of Indole Acetic Acid were tested individually and in consortia for plant growth promoting and fitness related traits of Cicer arietinum. In all experiments the presence of the nitrogen fixer Mesorhizobium ciceri resulted in increased biomass production.\xa0 In the absence of this strain, IAA Psedomonas putida and Bacillus megaterium hinder plant growth and fitness related traits. The application of mixes of the three strains always resulted in better plant performance when M. ciceri was present. Whereas P. putida has a noticeable plant growth-promoting effect B. megaterium resulted less effective. The low levels of IAA produced by the selected strains had a significantly greater positive effect on plant biomass accumulation, flower, pods and seed production as well as on total plant nitrogen and nitrogen concentration in seed than high IAA producer strains.', u'/manuscript/201703.0018/v1', [u'Agricultural Sciences & Agronomy'], []]
