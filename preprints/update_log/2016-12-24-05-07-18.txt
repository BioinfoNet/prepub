[u'Antibacterial Activity of Ethanolic Extract of Cinnamon Bark and Honey and Their Combination Effects Against Acne Causing Bacteria', ['Elin Julianti', 'Kasturi K. Rajah', 'Irda Fidrianny'], u'December 23 2016', u'Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis are the major skin bacteria that cause the formation of acne. The present study was conducted to investigate antibacterial activity of ethanolic extract of cinnamon bark, honey and their combination against acne bacteria. The antibacterial activity of extract of cinnamon bark and honey were investigated against P. acnes and S. epidermidis using disc diffusion method. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) were performed using Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI) methods. The interaction combination between extract of cinnamon bark and honey was determined by using a checkerboards method. The results showed that he MIC of extract of cinnamon bark and honey against P. acne were 256 \xb5g/mL and 50% v/v, respectively, while against S. epidermidis were 1024 \xb5g/mL and 50% v/v, respectively. The MBC of extract of cinnamon against P. acnes and S. epidermidis were more than 2048 \xb5g/mL, whereas the MBC for honey against P. acnes and S. epidermidis were 100%. The combination of cinnamon bark extract and honey against against P. acnes and S. epidermidis, showed additive activity with the FICI value 0.625. Therefore, the combination of extract of cinnamon bark and honey has potential activity against acne causing bacteria.', u'/manuscript/201612.0121/v1', [u'Dermatology'], []]
[u'\u03b2-Glucans and Post Prandial Satiety: The Role of Intestinal Hormones in Healthy Volunteers', ['Sara Baldassano', 'Silvio Buscemi', 'Anna Aiello', 'Giulia Accardi', 'Calogero Caruso', 'Sonya Vasto'], u'December 23 2016', u'Recent interest in intestinal hormones has risen with the idea that they modulate glucose tolerance and food intake through a variety of mechanisms, and such hormones like peptide YY (PYY), ghrelin, glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 and 2, and cholecystokinin (CKK) are therefore excellent therapeutic candidates for the treatment of diabetes and obesity. Furthermore, in the recent years, multiple studies suggest that the microbiota is critically important for normal host functions, while impaired host microbiota interactions contribute to the pathogenesis of numerous common metabolic disorders. In this study, we considered the nutraceutical effects of \u03b2-glucans added to pasta at the concentration of 6g\\100g. Ten participants have been recruited and hematochemical analyses and intestinal hormones tests have been performed before and after 30 days of pasta intake. Stool specimens have been studied for Lactobacillus Fermentum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus salivarius, Bifidobacterium longum, and Enterococcus faecium presence before and after 30 days of nutritional intervention. After 30 days of regular intake of pasta enriched by \u03b2-glucans results have been evaluated. In conclusion, pasta prepared from barley flour enriched with \u03b2-glucans at 6% exhibit promising responses on glucose metabolism, on intestinal hormones responses and on microbiota modification.', u'/manuscript/201612.0120/v1', [u'Nutrition'], []]
[u'Food Additives and Contaminants: Effects on Human Gut Microbiota\u2014A Review', ['Paula Roca-Saavedra', 'Veronica Mendez-Vilabrille', 'Jose Manuel Miranda', 'Alexandre Lamas', 'Carolina Nebot', 'Alejandra Cardelle-Cobas', 'Carlos M. Franco', 'Alberto Cepeda'], u'December 23 2016', u'Gut bacteria play an important role in several metabolic processes and human diseases, such as obesity and its co-morbidities, like fatty liver disease, insulin resistance/diabetes and cardiovascular events. Among several factors, dietary patterns, probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, antimicrobials and non-dietary factors, such as stress, age, exercise and climatic conditions, can dramatically impact the human gut microbiota diversity and equilibrium. However, the effect of minor food constituents, including food additives and trace contaminants, on human gut microbiota has received less attention. Consequently, the present review aimed to provide an objective perspective of the current knowledge regarding the impacts of minor food constituents on human gut microbiota and consequently, on human health.', u'/manuscript/201612.0119/v1', [u'Nutrition'], []]
