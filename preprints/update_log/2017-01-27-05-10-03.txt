[u'Iron Deficiency Anemia (IDA) in Pregnant Women of Different Ages in Swat District, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Pakistan', ['Atta Ullah', 'Ali Muhammad Yousafzai', 'Gul Nabi Khan', 'Nasir Iqbal', 'Bashir Ahmad'], u'January 27 2017', u'Abstract: The aim of this study was to find out the incidence of anemia in pregnant women of Swat District; to analyze the iron variations and its dietary effects.Data were collected during the periods of January \u2013 September 2016. The study of samples comprised of 250 pregnant women in the different trimester. Blood sample from each woman was collected and full blood count (FBC) was conducted through Mindray BC-3000 plus hem analyzer for all pregnant individuals. Confirmed anemic cases were then examined for IDA with serum ferritin, serum iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC) through Randox kit and serum transferrin saturation was estimated by formula (serum ferritin saturation =serum iron \xd7100/TIBC). The total number of participants in the first trimester were 50, among them 26 women were suffer from iron deficiency anemia (IDA) with 52% weightage of prevalence rate, (mean Hb concentration 9.602 \xb1 0.87 g/dl). The rates of IDA were 63.3%; ( mean Hb concentration 8.48 \xb1 1.24 g/dl) and 54%; ( mean Hb concentration 9.18 \xb1 1.28 g/dl), among 150 and 50 participants in the second and third trimester, respectively. A significant correlation was found between serum ferritin and Hb, serum ferritin against MCV and serum ferritin against MCH. The high prevalence of anemia was found 78.2% in the age group from 26-30 followed by 78.2% in the age group 36-40 years compared to those of other age groups in the second trimester. In this study the prevalence of IDA in third trimester is lower compared to first and second trimester.', u'/manuscript/201701.0126/v1', [u'Animal Sciences & Zoology'], []]
[u'Polygenic Selection, Polygenic Scores, Spatial Autocorrelation and Correlated Allele Frequencies. Can We Model Polygenic Selection on Intellectual Abilities?', ['Davide Piffer'], u'January 27 2017', u'The majority of polygenic selection signal of educational attainment GWAS hits is confined to a handful of SNPs within genomic regions replicated across GWAS publications. A polygenic score comprising 9 SNPs predicts population IQ (r=0.9), outperforming 99.9% of the polygenic scores obtained from sets of random SNPs. Its predictive power remains unaffected after controlling for spatial autocorrelation. Even random polygenic scores are moderate predictors of population IQ, and their predictive power increases logarithmically with the number of SNPs, indicating an exponential reduction in noise.Thus, the predictive power of polygenic scores has to be scaled in proportion to the number of SNPs composing them.', u'/manuscript/201701.0127/v1', [u'Genetics'], []]
