[u'Antioxidant Activity from Peel and Seed of Melon (Cucumis melo L. var. reticulatus) and Its Antiproliferative Effect in Cancer Cells', ['Priscilla Moura Rolim Madeira', 'Gabriel Pereira Fidelis', 'Hugo Alexandre Oliveira Rocha', 'Everaldo Silvino dos Santos', 'Gorete Ribeiro de Macedo'], u'November 8 2016', u'Extracts of melon residues were prepared and their antioxidants and antiproliferative activities were evaluated. Total phenolic compounds were found to hydroethanolic, hydromethanolic and aqueous extracts, especially for melon peel (1.016 mg in gallic acid equivalent 100g-1). By means of the phytochemical analysis in thin layer chromatography, it was possible to verify the presence of compounds with structures terpenes and saponins. Flavonoids total content were found especially for melon peel aqueous extract 262 \u03bcg of catechin equivalent 100g-1. The concentrations of carotenoids in melon peel and seed residues were 96 and 9.59 \u03bcg total carotenoids g-1, respectively. Tannins were found in highest quantities in melon peel extract (309 \u03bcg of catechin equivalent in 100g-1). For total antioxidant capacity, expressed as ascorbic acid equivalent, the hydroethanolic and hydromethanolic extracts for peels and hydromethanolic for seed showed, respectively, 89 mg g-1, 74mg g-1 and 83mg g-1. Different extracts of melon showed chelating activity of the iron and copper ions in different concentrations, especially melon peel aqueous extract, reaching values of 61% for iron chelating and 84% for copper. The hydroethanolic extract of melon peel showed significant ability to hydroxyl radicals scavenging (68%), one of the more reactive radicals. To antiproliferative potential in human cancer cell lines, such as kidney carcinoma, colorectal carcinoma, cervical adenocarcinoma and carcinoma, were investigated by MTT assay. The proliferation was inhibited by 20%\u201385% at extracts concentrations of 0.1\u20131.0 mg mL-1 to all cancer cell lines. The results suggest that melon residues extracts display a high antioxidant activity in in vitro assays and have been effective biological activity against the growth of human tumor cells.', u'/manuscript/201611.0045/v1', [u'Biotechnology'], [u'Laboratory of Biochemistry Engineer, Department of Chemical Engineer,  Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN), Natal-RN 59078-970, Brazil', u'Laboratory of Biotechnology of Natural Polymers (BIOPOL), Department of Biochemistry,  Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN), Natal-RN 59078-970, Brazil']]
