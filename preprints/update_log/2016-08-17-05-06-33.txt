[u'Cranberries and Cancer: An Update of Preclinical Studies Evaluating the Cancer Inhibitory Potential of Cranberry and Cranberry Derived Constituents', ['Katherine M. Weh', 'Jennifer Clarke', 'Laura A. Kresty'], u'August 16 2016', u'Cranberries are rich in bioactive constituents reported to influence a variety of health benefits, ranging from improved immune function and decreased infections to reduced cardiovascular disease and more recently cancer inhibition. A review of cranberry research targeting cancer revealed positive effects of cranberries or cranberry derived constituents against 17 different cancers utilizing a variety of in vitro techniques; whereas, in vivo studies supported the inhibitory action of cranberries toward cancers of the esophagus, stomach, colon, bladder, prostate, glioblastoma and lymphoma. Mechanisms of cranberry-linked cancer inhibition include cellular death induction via apoptosis, necrosis and autophagy; reduction of cellular proliferation; alterations in reactive oxygen species; and modification of cytokine and signal transduction pathways. Given the emerging positive preclinical effects of cranberries, future clinical directions targeting cancer or premalignancy will be considered', u'/manuscript/201608.0160/v1', [u'Nutrition'], [u'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Medical College of Wisconsin, 8701 Watertown Plank Road, Milwaukee, WI 53226, USA', u'Department of Food Science and Technology, University of Nebraska, 256 Food Innovation Complex, Lincoln, NE 68588-6205, USA', u'Department of Statistics, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, NE 68583, USA', u'Quantitative Life Sciences Initiative, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, NE 68583, USA']]
