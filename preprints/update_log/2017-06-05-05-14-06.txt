[u'Correcting Names of Bacteria: An Analyzed Sequence Data Necessary for Taxonomic Recategorization of Misclassified Lysinibacillus Species Deposited in Microbial Repositories', [], u'June 5 2017', u'Genomics analysis and digitalized data of the twenty-four Lysinibacillus species deposited in renowned Microbial Culture Collections of India. This paper presents data of Lysinibacillus species 16S rRNA gene sequences. Sequences were digitalized to provide quick response (QR) codes, Chaose Game Representation (CGR) and Frequency of Chaose Game Representation (FCGR). GC percentage, phylogenetic analysis, and principal component analysis (PCA) are tools for the differentiation and reclassification of the studied strains. Leaves of identity with type strains of related species range from 90% to 93% suggesting a reclassification is needed to correctly assign species names to the analyzed Lysinibacillus strains available in Microbial Culture Collections in India.', u'/manuscript/201706.0025/v1', [u'Microbiology'], []]
