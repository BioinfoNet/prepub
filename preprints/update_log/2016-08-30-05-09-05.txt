[u'Hsa_circ_0054633 in Peripheral Blood Can be Used as a Diagnostic Biomarker of Pre-Diabetes and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus', ['Muwei Li', 'Zhenzhou Zhao', 'Xuejie Li', 'Chuanyu Gao', 'Dongdong Jian', 'Peiyuan Hao', 'Lixin Rao'], u'August 29 2016', u'The purpose of current study was to investigate the expression characteristic of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in peripheral blood of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients and their potentials as diagnostic biomarkers for pre-diabetes and T2DM. In present study, the circRNAs in the peripheral blood from 6 healthy individuals and 6 T2DM patients were collected for microarray analysis. The results indicated that there were 489 differentially expressed circRNAs, of which 78 were upregulated and 411 were downregulated in the T2DM group. Then we selected 5 circRNAs as the candidate biomarkers under a stricter screening criteria and further verified them in another cohort (control group, n=20; pre-diabetes group, n =20; T2DM group; n=20). 3 of the 5 circRNAs presented upregulated expression in the experimental groups, including 2 circRNAs of the T2DM group that had higher expression than the pre-diabetes group. Hsa_circ_0054633 was identified to have the largest area value under the carve (AUC). In another independent cohort (control group, n=60; pre-diabetes group, n=63; T2DM group, n=64), the diagnostic capacity of hsa_circ_0054633 was tested. The results showed that the AUC for the diagnosis of pre-diabetes was 0.751(95% confidence interval=[0. 666-0.835], P\uff1c0.001) while it was 0.793 ([0.716-0.871], P\uff1c0.001) for the diagnosis of T2DM. After including the risk factors of T2DM, the AUC increased to 0.841 ([0.773-0.910], P <0.001) and 0.834 ([0.762-0.905], P <0.001), respectively. Hsa_circ_0054633 presented a certain diagnostic capability for pre-diabetes and T2DM.', u'/manuscript/201608.0225/v1', [u'Cardiology'], [u"Department of Cardiology, People's Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450003, China", u'Department of Cardiology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China']]
