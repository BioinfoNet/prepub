[u'Antioxidant Activity and Isolation of \u03b2-Sitosterol from Ethyl Acetate Extract of Aerial Parts of Consolida orientalis', ['Abbas Ali Dehpour'], u'September 9 2016', u'General phytochemical screening of the aerial parts of Consolida orientalis revealed the presence of steroids, terpenes, phenolic compounds, saponins, fatty acids, alkaloids. This study was conducted to investigate the bioactivities of extracts, isolation and identification the compounds from aerial parts of C.orientalis. The main goal of the present study is identifying and characterizing the antioxidant activity of the Consolida orientalis and biological isolation of active terpenoid. Aerial parts of the plant were dried at room temperature and reduced to small pieces, followed by using extraction with ethyl acetate percolation. Tree complementary analysis system was used, DPPH free radical scavenging test, total phenolic metabolites and FRAP. The total phenolic content was 38.83\xb12.09 mg gallic acid corresponding to g-1 extract with regarding to standard curve (y=0.0054x+0.0488, r2=0.995). IC50 value for DPPH radical \u2013 scavenging was 987.11\xb128.66 mgml-1. The extract was exhibited a medium reducing power compared with Vit C. The isolation and purification was afforded white crystalline powder which was subjected to physical, chemical and spectral identification by IR, 1H- and 13C- NMR and GC-MS. Isolated compound was identified as \u03b2-sitosterol. That is a terpenoid with melting point 133.4-134.5 \u0366 c and with molecular formula C29H50O.', u'/manuscript/201609.0037/v1', [u'Plant Sciences'], [u'Department of Biology, Islamic Azad University, Qaemshhahr Branch, Qaemshahr, Iran']]
[u'Antidermatophytic Activity of the Fruticose Lichen Usnea orientalis', ['Ashutosh Pathak', 'Anupam Dikshit'], u'September 9 2016', u'In the present study, the new biological sources in the form of lichen Usnea orientalis Motyka was screened for its antidermatophytic potential. Six species of dermatophytes were chosen on the basis of their prevalence for antidermatophytic assays, and the Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI)-recommended broth microdilution procedure was used to detect the efficacy of extract against dermatophytes. Thin layer chromatography of lichen extracts reveals the presence of two secondary metabolites viz. salazinic acid and usnic acid. U. orientalis extract exhibited promising antidermatophytic activity against all tested pathogens. Amongst all tested pathogens, E. floccosum exhibited most susceptibility towards extract, whereas T. mentagrophytes exhibited the least susceptibility. Topical application of U. orientalis extract might be helpful in the cure of dermal infections.', u'/manuscript/201609.0034/v1', [u'Pharmacology & Toxicology'], [u'Biological Product Lab, Department of Botany, University of Allahabad, Allahabad 211012, U.P., India', u'Lichenology Laboratory, CSIR-National Botanical Research Institute, Rana Pratap Marg, Lucknow 226001, U.P., India']]
