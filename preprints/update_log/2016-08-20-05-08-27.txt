[u'Synergistic Effects of Trimethoprim with Flos Lonicerae on Antibacterial Activity and Dose-Effect Relationship in Vitro', ['Yizhe Cui', 'Qiuju Wang', 'Xin Wang'], u'August 19 2016', u'Observe the synergistic effect and dose-effect relationship of Trimethoprim (TMP) on bactericidal activity with Flos Lonicerae in vitro. Microamount chessboard dilution method was conducted to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Trimethoprim, Flos Lonicerae, as well as the combination of Trimethoprim and Flos Lonicerae separately against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli in vitro and Salmonella. The pour plate count method was used to determine the combined bactericidal activity of Flos Lonicerae combined with Different concentrations TMP. The results showed that the MIC values of the combination of Flos Lonicerae with TMP was much less than the MIC values of the independent use of Flos Lonicerae or TMP, The FIC values of the combination of Flos Lonicerae with TMP were between 0.5 and 1, there was additive effect between them. The bactericidal rates were fitted with least square method, the 95% confidence intervals of the optimal blending quantity about the combination of Flos Lonicerae with TMP on the test organisms were 231\u03bcg\xb7mL-1-249\u03bcg\xb7mL-1, 237\u03bcg\xb7mL-1-259\u03bcg\xb7mL-1, and 235 -259\u03bcg\xb7mL-1', u'/manuscript/201608.0175/v1', [u'Veterinary Medicine'], [u'College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Heilongjiang Bayi Agricultural University,  No. 2 Xinyang Road, New Development District, Daqing 163319, China']]
