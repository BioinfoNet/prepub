[u'Amentoflavone Attenuate Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Inflammation in BV2 Microglia via MAPKs-NF\u03baB Pathway', ['Wai-Shing Leung', 'Shiuan-Shinn Lee', 'Ming-Ling Yang', 'Chi-Wen Kuo', 'Hui-Wen Lin', 'Yung-Chyuan Ho', 'Yu-Hsiang Kuan'], u'November 14 2016', u'Amentoflavone, also called didemethyl-ginkgetin 3\u2019,8\u201d biapigenin, is a plant bioflavonoid found in serval plants, such as Ginkgo biloba, Chamaecyparis obtusa, Hypericum perforatum, and Selaginella tamariscina, etc. Amentoflavone has a number of bio-pharmacological effects including anti-inflammation, antioxidation, anti-virus, neuroprotection, and anti-cancer. At present study, we found that secretion of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and nitric oxide (NO) were inhibited by amentoflavone in a concentration-dependent manner in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/interferon\u03b3 (INF\u03b3)-stimulated BV2 microglial cells. LPS/INF\u03b3 induced protein expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) was inhibited by amentoflavone in the same concentration range. Moreover, amentoflavone not only reduced the phosphorylation of nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB but also inhibited the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK, induced by LPS. In addition, a parallel concentration-dependent manner was observed in inhibition of secretion of PGE2 and NO, expression of iNOS and COX-2, and phosphorylation of MAPKs and NF\u03baB pathway. These results suggested that amentoflavone possessed potential against LPS/INF\u03b3-induced secretion of PGE2 and NO via downregulation of iNOS and COX-2 expressions by blocking activation of NF\u03baB pathway via phosphorylation of MAPKs.', u'/manuscript/201611.0069/v1', [u'Nutrition'], [u'Department of Emergency Medicine, Jen-Ai Hospital, Taichung 40041, Taiwan', u'School of Public Health, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung 40201, Taiwan', u'Department of Anatomy, School of Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung 40201, Taiwan', u'Department of Pharmacology, Jen-Ai Hospital, Taichung 40041, Taiwan', u'Central Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taichung 40601, Taiwan', u'Department of Optometry, Asia University, Taichung 41354, Taiwan', u'Department of Medical Research, China Medical University Hospital, China Medical University, Taichung 40402, Taiwan', u'School of Medical Applied Chemistry, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung 40201, Taiwan', u'Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung 40201, Taiwan', u'Department of Pharmacy, Chung Shan Medical University Hospital, Taichung 40201, Taiwan']]
