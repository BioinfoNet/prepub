[u'Anticancer Effect of Polyphyllin \u0399 on Colon Cancer Cells through ROS-Dependent Autophagy and G2/M Arrest Induction Mechanisms', ['Si Yu', 'Lijiao Wang', 'Zhixing Cao', 'Daoyin Gong', 'Qianyi Liang', 'Hanting Chen', 'Huizhu Fu', 'Wenwen Wang', 'Xue Tang', 'Zihao Xie', 'Yang He', 'Cheng Peng', 'Yuzhi Li'], u'February 3 2017', u'Polyphyllin \u0399, an important constituent isolated from the rhizoma of Paris polyphyllin, has exhibited preclinical anticancer efficacy in various cancer types. In this study, we performed to investigate the anti-colorectal tumor property of Polyphyllin \u0399 by inducing autophagy and G2/M arrest in human colorectal cancer cells, and to define the potential molecular mechanisms. The anti-colon cancer activity of Polyphyllin \u0399 was assessed using CCK8 assay. Autophagy was monitored by mRFP-GFP-LC3 fluorescence analysis. Cell cycles were measured by flow cytometry. The levels of ROS were measured by flow cytometer and laser confocal microscope analysis. The expressions or activition of LC3-\u2161 and cycle regulatory proteins were detected through western blotting. As shown in our results, Polyphyllin \u0399 significantly inhibited the proliferation of colon cancer cell HCT116. Under a confocal microscope, we observed massive flux of autophagy and large number of autophagy body in many HCT116 cells treated by Polyphyllin \u0399. Next, we found that Polyphyllin \u0399 induces autophagy in a ROS-dependent manner and not related with PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Meanwhile, we proved that excessive ROS triggered by Polyphyllin \u0399 also could induce cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase via regulating the expression of cycle regulatory proteins, such as p21, p27, cyclinB1. Collectively, These results provide an interesting discovery about the induction of autophagy and G2/M arrest by Polyphyllin \u0399 administration, and indicated that Polyphyllin \u0399 is an effective and promising candidate to be further developed as therapeutic agents in the treatment of colon cancer.', u'/manuscript/201702.0007/v1', [u'Pharmacology & Toxicology'], []]
[u'Seroprevalence of West Nile Virus among Blood Donors at Central Blood Bank, Khartoum State, Sudan', ['Yousof S. Yousof', 'Salma E. Ahmed', 'Mona H. Mona', 'Maha M. Nour', 'Mahmmoud S. Saleh', 'Mohamed I. Garbi', 'Elmontasir S. Eltayeb'], u'February 3 2017', u'Background: West Nile virus is one of the transfusion transmitted viral infections with worldwide distribution; it can cause severe disorders of the Central Nervous System. Aim: This research aimed to provide information about the seroprevalence of WNV among blood donors at Central Blood Bank, Khartoum State-Sudan. Materials & methods: Ninety sera specimen were randomly collected from blood donors at Central Blood Bank. All collected sera specimen were tested for the presence anti-West Nile virus (IgM & IgG) antibodies by using semi-quantitative indirect ELISA. Results: Out of Ninety blood donor sera, 40 (44.4 %) were reactive for anti-WNV IgG antibody, whereas 2 (2.2%) were reactive for anti-WNV IgM antibody. Conclusion & recommendations: In spite of higher percentage of Blood Donors at Central Blood Bank, Khartoum State-Sudan was exposed to West Nile virus, there were few recent cases. High care should be taken by health authorities for screening of blood donors, particularly when administered to immunocompromised patients.', u'/manuscript/201702.0008/v1', [u'Virology'], []]
