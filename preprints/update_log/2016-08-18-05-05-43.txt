[u'Pueraria mirifica Exerts Estrogenic Effect and Promotes Mammary and Endometrial', ['Anna Kakehashi', 'Midori Yoshida', 'Yoshiyuki Tago', 'Naomi Ishii', 'Min Gi', 'Hideki Wanibuchi'], u'August 17 2016', u'Pueraria mirifica (PM) is a plant which dried and powdered tuberous root is now widely used as a rejuvenating herb to promote youthfulness in both men and women. In this study, we investigated the modifying effects of PM at various doses on mammary and endometrial carcinogenesis in female Donryu rats. Firstly, PM administered to ovariectomized Donryu rats at doses of 0.03, 0.3 and 3% in phytoestrogen-low diet for 2 weeks induced the significant increases of uterus weight. Secondly, 4-week PM application to non-operated rats at a dose of 3% after the 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) initiation, resulted in significant elevation of cell proliferation in the mammary glands. In the third experiment, postpubertal administration of 0.3% (200 mg/kg b.w./day) PM to 5-week-old non-operated animals for 36 weeks following the initiation of mammary and endometrial carcinogenesis with DMBA and N-ethyl-N\u2032-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (ENNG), respectively, caused significant increases of mammary adenocarcinoma incidence and multiplicity. A trend for increase of uterine adenocarcinomas and a significant increase of endometrial atypical hyperplasia multiplicity was observed at 0.3% PM. Furthermore, PM at doses of 0.3 and mostly 1% induced dilatation, hemorrhage and inflammation of the uterine wall. In conclusion, the postpubertal long-term PM administration to Donryu rats exerted estrogenic effect in the mammary gland and uterus, and at a dose of 200 mg/kg b.w./day promoted carcinogenesis initiated by DMBA and ENNG.', u'/manuscript/201608.0165/v1', [u'Oncology & Oncogenics'], [u'Department of Molecular Pathology, Osaka City University Graduate School of Medicine,  1-4-3 Asahi-machi, Abeno-ku, Osaka 545-8585, Japan', u'Division of Pathology, Biological Safety Research Center, National Institute of Health Sciences, Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, 1-18-1 Kamiyoga, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo 158-8501, Japan']]
[u'Assessment of Vitamin B12 in Patients with Coronary Tortuosity', ['Levent Cerit', 'Hatice Kemal', 'Aziz Gunsel', 'Murat Uncu', 'Zeynep Cerit', 'Kamil Gulsen', 'Hamza Duygu'], u'August 17 2016', u'Background: Vitamin B 12 deficiency has been implicated in endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular disease via hyperhomocysteinemia. Coronary tortuosity (CorT) is a common coronary angiography finding. The etiology, clinical implication and long term prognosis are still not well clarified. This study was conducted with the aim to evaluate the relationship between CorT and vitamin B12. Subjects and Method: The medical records of consecutive patients, who underwent coronary angiography, were retrospectively reviewed. The study group consisted of 1624 patients. Taking into consideration the inclusion criteria, 212 patients with CorT and 210 patients with normal coronary angiographies (control group) were included in the study. Vitamin B12, other biochemical parameters, clinical and echocardiographic parameters, and CorT score were evaluated in all patients. CorT is defined as fixed 3 bends during both systole and diastole, with each bend \u226545 \xb0. Results: Patients with CorT had higher prevalence of older, female gender, hypertension, current smoking. Vitamin B12 was significantly decreased in patient with CorT (134.7\xb147.8 vs 239.6\xb153.8 p<0.001). On multivariate analysis age, female gender, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and vitamin B12 were independent predictors for CorT (OR 1.56; 95% CI: 1.247\u20131.962; p < 0.001, OR 1.628; 95% CI: 1.376-2.048; p<0.001, OR 1.865; 95% CI: 1.387-2.695; p<0.001, OR 1.362; 95% CI: 1.184-1.726; p<0.001, OR 1.862; 95% CI: 1.486-2.674; p<0.001, respectively). Conclusion: In our study, we have founded a significant relationship between vitamin B12 deficiency and CorT.', u'/manuscript/201608.0164/v1', [u'Cardiology'], [u'Department of Cardiology, Near East University Hospital, 99138 Nicosia, Cyprus', u'Department of Biochemistry, Near East University Hospital, 99138 Nicosia, Cyprus', u'Department of Pediatrics, Near East University Hospital, 99138 Nicosia, Cyprus']]
[u'Characterization of Chemically-Induced Bacterial Ghosts (BGs) Using Sodium Hydroxide-Induced Vibrio parahaemolyticus Ghosts (VPGs)', ['Hyun Jung Park', 'Sung Oh', 'Nagarajan Vinod', 'Seongmi Ji', 'Han Byul Noh', 'Jung Mo Koo', 'Su Hyeong Lee', 'Sei Chang Kim', 'Ki-Sung Lee', 'Chang Won Choi'], u'August 17 2016', u'Acellular bacterial ghosts (BGs) are empty non-living bacterial cell envelopes, commonly generated by controlled expression of the cloned lysis gene E of bacteriophage PhiX174. In this study, Vibrio parahaemolyticus ghosts (VPGs) were generated by chemically induced lysis and the method is based on minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of sodium hydroxide (NaOH), acetic acid, boric acid, citric acid, maleic acid, hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid. The MIC values of the respective chemicals were 3.125, 6.25, < 50.0, 25.0, 6.25, 1.56 and 0.781 mg/ml. Except boric acid, the lysis efficiency was reached more than 99.99% at 5 min after treatment of all chemicals. Among those chemicals, NaOH-induced VPGs showed completely DNA-free that was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. Besides, lipopolysaccharides (LPS) extracted from the NaOH-induced VPGs showed no distinctive band on SDS-PAGE gel after silver staining. On the other hand, LPS extracted from wild-type bacterial cells as well as the organic acids-induced VPGs showed triple major bands and LPS extracted from the inorganic acids-induced VPGs showed double bands. It suggests that some surface structures in LPS of the NaOH-induced VPGs may be lost, weakened or modified by the MIC of NaOH. Nevertheless, Limulus amoebocyte lysate assay revealed that there is no significant difference in endotoxic activity between the NaOH-induced VPGs and wild-type bacterial cells. Macrophages exposed to the NaOH-induced VPGs at 0.5 \xd7 106 CFU/mL showed cell viability of 97.9%, however the MIC of NaOH did not reduce the cytotoxic effect of wild-type bacterial cells. Like Escherichia coli LPS, the NaOH-induced VPGs are an excellent activator of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2 and iNOS), anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) and dual activities (IL-6) in the stimulated macrophage cells. On the other hand, the induction of TNF-\u03b1 mRNA was remarkable in the macrophages exposed with wild-type cells. Scanning electron microscopy showed the formation of trans-membrane lysis tunnel structures in the NaOH-induced VPGs. SDS-PAGE and agarose gel electrophoresis also confirmed that cytoplasmic proteins and genomic DNA released from the VPGs to culture medium through the lysis tunnel structures. Taken together, all these results indicated that the NaOH-induced VPGs show the potency of safe, economical and effective inactivated bacterial vaccine candidate.', u'/manuscript/201608.0162/v1', [u'Microbiology'], [u'Department of Biology & Medicinal Science, Pai Chai University, Daejeon 35345, Korea', u'CheongShim International Academy, Gapyeong-gun, Gyeonggi-do 12461, Korea']]
