[u'Theranostics in Nuclear Medicine Practice', ['Anna Yordanova', 'Elisabeth Eppard', 'Stefan Kurpig', 'Stefan Schonberger', 'Maria Gonzalez-Carmona', 'Georg Feldmann', 'Hojjat Ahmadzadehfar', 'Markus Essler'], u'January 22 2017', u'TThe importance of personalized medicine is growing, since there is an urged need to avoid unnecessary and expensive treatments. In nuclear medicine, the theranostic approach is an established tool for a specific molecular targeting in means of diagnostics and therapy. The visualisation of potential targets can help to predict if a patient would benefit from a particular treatment or not. Thanks to the quick development of radiopharmaceuticals and diagnostic techniques, the use of theranostic agents is constantly rising. In this article important milestones of nuclear therapies and diagnostics in the context of theranostics are highlighted. It begins with the well-known radioiodine therapy in patients with thyroid cancer and then guides through different approaches for the treatment of advanced cancer with targeted therapies. The aim of this review is to provide a summary of background knowledge, current applications and advantages of targeted therapies and imaging in nuclear medicine practice.', u'/manuscript/201701.0094/v1', [u'Oncology & Oncogenics'], []]
