[u'The Quest for a Vaccine against Coccidioidomycosis, A Neglected Disease of the Americas', ['Theo N. Kirkland'], u'December 15 2016', u'Coccidioidomycosis (Valley Fever) is a disease caused by inhalation of Coccidioides spp. This neglected tropical disease of the Americas has substantial public health impact despite its geographic restriction to desert areas of the southwestern U.S., Mexico, Central and South America. The incidence of this infection in California and Arizona has been increasing over the past fifteen years. The burden of disease in outside the U.S. remains poorly understood. Several large cities are within the endemic region in the U.S. Coccidioidomycosis accounts for 25,000 hospital admissions per year in California. While most cases of coccidioidomycosis resolve spontaneously, up to 40% are severe enough to require anti-fungal treatment, and a significant number disseminate beyond the lungs. Disseminated infection, especially involving the meninges, is fatal without appropriate treatment. Infection with Coccidioides spp. is protective against a second infection, so vaccination seems biologically plausible. This review of efforts to develop a vaccine against coccidioidomycosis focuses on vaccine approaches and the difficulties in identifying protein antigen/adjuvant combinations that protect in experimental mouse models. Although the quest for a vaccine has not yet resulted in a clinically useful product, scientific efforts of vaccine development pave the way for future success.', u'/manuscript/201612.0076/v1', [u'General Medical Research'], []]
[u'Absence of RstA Results in Delayed Initiation of DNA Replication in Escherichia coli', ['Yuan Yao', 'Runxiu Zhu'], u'December 15 2016', u'Bacterial two-component systems are responsible for both sensing and initiating a response to a wide range of environmental changes. RstB/RstA is an uncharacterized Escherichia coli two-component system, the regulatory effects of which on the E. coli cell cycle remain unclear. We found that while the doubling time and average number of replication origins per cell in an \u0394rstB mutant were the same as the wild-type, the average number of replication origins in an \u0394rstA mutant was 18.2% lower than in wild-type cells. The doubling times were 34 min, 35 min, and 40 min for the wild-type, \u0394rstB, and \u0394rstA strains, respectively. Ectopic expression of RstA from plasmid pACYC-rstA partly reversed the \u0394rstA mutant phenotypes. The amount of initiator protein DnaA per cell was reduced by 40% in the \u0394rstA mutant compared with the wild-type, but the concentration of DnaA did not change as the total amount of cellular protein was also reduced in these cells. Our results suggest that deletion of RstA leads to delayed initiation of DNA replication, and that RstA may indirectly affect initiation of replication by controlling expression of dnaA.', u'/manuscript/201612.0080/v1', [u'Microbiology'], []]
