[u'Cell biology and genetics of minimal change disease', ['Moin A. Saleem', 'Yasuko Kobayashi'], u'30 Mar 2016', u'Minimal change disease (MCD) is an important cause of nephrotic syndrome and is characterized by massive proteinuria and hypoalbuminemia, resulting in edema and hypercholesterolemia. The podocyte plays a key role in filtration and its disruption results in a dramatic loss of function leading to proteinuria. Immunologic disturbance has been suggested in the pathogenesis of MCD. Because of its clinical features, such as recurrent relapse/remission course, steroid response in most patients, and rare familial cases, a genetic defect has been thought to be less likely in MCD. Recent progress in whole-exome sequencing reveals pathogenic mutations in familial cases in steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS) and sheds light on possible mechanisms and key molecules in podocytes in MCD. On the other hand, in the majority of cases, the existence of circulating permeability factors has been implicated along with T lymphocyte dysfunction. Observations of benefit with rituximab added B cell involvement to the disease. Animal models are unsatisfactory, and the humanized mouse may be a good model that well reflects MCD pathophysiology to investigate suggested \u201cT cell dysfunction\u201d directly related to podocytes in vivo. Several candidate circulating factors and their effects on podocytes have been proposed but are still not sufficient to explain whole mechanisms and clinical features in MCD. Another circulating factor disease is focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), and it is not clear if this is a distinct entity, or on the same spectrum, implicating the same circulating factor(s). These patients are mostly steroid resistant and often have a rapid relapse after transplantation. In clinical practice, predicting relapse or disease activity and response to steroids is important and is an area where novel biomarkers can be developed based on our growing knowledge of podocyte signaling pathways.

[u'Probiotics in critically ill children', ['Sunit C. Singhi', 'Suresh Kumar'], u'29 Mar 2016', u'Gut microflora contribute greatly to immune and nutritive functions and act as a physical barrier against pathogenic organisms across the gut mucosa. Critical illness disrupts the balance between host and gut microflora, facilitating colonization, overgrowth, and translocation of pathogens and microbial products across intestinal mucosal barrier and causing systemic inflammatory response syndrome and sepsis. Commonly used probiotics, which have been developed from organisms that form gut microbiota, singly or in combination, can restore gut microflora and offer the benefits similar to those offered by normal gut flora, namely immune enhancement, improved barrier function of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), and prevention of bacterial translocation. Enteral supplementation of probiotic strains containing either Lactobacillus alone or in combination with Bifidobacterium reduced the incidence and severity of necrotizing enterocolitis and all-cause mortality in preterm infants. Orally administered Lactobacillus casei subspecies rhamnosus, Lactobacillus reuteri, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus were effective in the prevention of late-onset sepsis and GIT colonization by Candida in preterm very low birth weight infants. In critically ill children, probiotics are effective in the prevention and treatment of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Oral administration of a mix of probiotics for 1 week to children on broad-spectrum antibiotics in a pediatric intensive care unit decreased GIT colonization by Candida, led to a 50% reduction in candiduria, and showed a trend toward decreased incidence of candidemia. However, routine use of probiotics cannot be supported on the basis of current scientific evidence. Safety of probiotics is also a concern; rarely, probiotics may cause bacteremia, fungemia, and sepsis in immunocompromised critically ill children.

[u'Airway hyperresponsiveness; smooth muscle as the principal actor', ['Anne-Marie Lauzon', 'James G. Martin'], u'09 Mar 2016', u'Airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) is a defining characteristic of asthma that refers to the capacity of the airways to undergo exaggerated narrowing in response to stimuli that do not result in comparable degrees of airway narrowing in healthy subjects. Airway smooth muscle (ASM) contraction mediates airway narrowing, but it remains uncertain as to whether the smooth muscle is intrinsically altered in asthmatic subjects or is responding abnormally as a result of the milieu in which it sits. ASM in the trachea or major bronchi does not differ in its contractile characteristics in asthmatics, but the more pertinent peripheral airways await complete exploration. The mass of ASM is increased in many but not all asthmatics and therefore cannot be a unifying hypothesis for AHR, although when increased in mass it may contribute to AHR. The inability of a deep breath to reverse or prevent bronchial narrowing in asthma may reflect an intrinsic difference in the mechanisms that lead to softening of contracted ASM when subjected to stretch. Cytokines such as interleukin-13 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 promote a more contractile ASM phenotype. The composition and increased stiffness of the matrix in which ASM is embedded promotes a more proliferative and pro-inflammatory ASM phenotype, but the expected dedifferentiation and loss of contractility have not been shown. Airway epithelium may drive ASM proliferation and/or molecular remodeling in ways that may lead to AHR. In conclusion, AHR is likely multifactorial in origin, reflecting the plasticity of ASM properties in the inflammatory environment of the asthmatic airway.', u'/articles/5-306/v1', ['Cardiopulmonary & Vascular Disorders', 'Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases', 'Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'Meakins-Christie Laboratories, McGill University Health Center Research Institute, Montreal, QC, Canada', u'Department of Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada']]

In clinical trials, the criteria used for defining participants with hypertension are mostly undefined. As a first step towards formally assessing the blood pressure (BP) patterns of children diagnosed with SLE, 24-hr ambulatory BP monitoring data was analyzed on clinic patients who presented with prehypertension or stage I hypertension. In this pediatric SLE cohort (n=10), 20% met daytime criteria for a diagnosis of hypertension. Patterns of BP elevation varied widely with white coat, masked, isolated systolic, and diastolic nocturnal hypertension all identified. Nocturnal hypertension was detected in 60% and attenuated nocturnal BP dipping in 90% of both hypertensive and normotensive SLE patients. In SLE patients, the median nighttime systolic and diastolic loads were 25% and 15.5% compared with median daily loads of 12.5% and 11.5%. Daytime and nighttime systolic and diastolic BP load and nocturnal dipping was compared to a control population consisting of 85 non-SLE patients under 21 years old with prehypertension or stage 1 hypertension presenting to hypertension clinic. Median systolic BP dipped 5.3 mmHg in SLE patients compared to 11.9 mmHg in non-lupus (p-value = 0.001). Median diastolic BP dipped 12.9 mmHg versus 18.5 mmHg in non-lupus (p-value = 0.003).

Heart failure patients discharged from rural hospitals, or primarily critical access hospitals, have higher 30-day readmission and mortality rates compared to patients discharged from urban hospitals. Self-management improves heart failure patients\u2019 health outcomes and reduces re-hospitalizations, but adherence to self-management guidelines is low. We propose a home based post-acute care service managed by advanced practice nurses to enhance patient activation and lead to the improvement of self-management adherence in heart failure patients discharged from rural hospitals.Objective This article describes the study design and research methods used to implement and evaluate the intervention.Method Our intervention is a 12-week patient activation (Patient AcTivated Care at Home [PATCH]) to improve self-management adherence. Patients were randomized into two parallel groups (12-week PATCH intervention + usual care vs. usual care only) to evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention. Outcomes were measured at baseline, 3 and 6 months.DiscussionThis study aimed to examine the effectiveness of a rural theory based, advance practice nurse led, activation enhancing intervention on the self-management adherence in heart failure patients residing in rural areas. Our expectation is to facilitate adherence to self-management behaviors in heart failure patients following discharge from rural hospitals and decrease complications and hospital readmissions, leading to the reduction of economic burden.\xa0Clinical Trial Registration Information: ClinicalTrials.gov; https://register.clinicaltrials.gov/ NCT01964053', u'/articles/3-317/v2', ['Cardiopulmonary & Vascular Disorders', 'Public Health & Epidemiology', 'Critical Care & Emergency Medicine'], [u'College of Nursing-Lincoln Division, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Lincoln, NE 68588-0220, USA', u'Department of Health Services Research & Administration College of Public Health, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198-4350, USA']]

RAPN is increasingly utilised in the management of small renal masses. To this end it is imperative that WIT is kept to a minimum to maintain renal function.Methods: RAPN was performed via a four-arm robotic transperitoneal approach. The renal artery and vein were individually clamped with robotic vascular bulldog clamps to allow cold scissor excision of the tumour. The cut surface was then sutured with one or two running 3-0 V-LocTM sutures, following which the vascular clamps were released. Specific bleeding vessels were then selectively oversewn and the collecting system repaired. Renorrhaphy was then completed using a running horizontal mattress 0-0 V-LocTM suture.Results: A total of 16 patients underwent RAPN with a median WIT of 15 minutes (range: 8-25), operative time 230 minutes (range: 180-280) and blood loss of 100 mL (range: 50-1000). There were no transfusions, secondary haemorrhages or urine leaks. There was one focal positive margin in a central 5.5 cm pT3a renal cell carcinomas (RCC). Long-term estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was not significantly different to pre-operative values.Conclusion: In this patient series, early vascular release effectively minimised WIT and maintained renal function without compromising perioperative safety.', u'/articles/4-108/v1', ['Cardiopulmonary & Vascular Disorders', 'Hepatology & Nephrology', 'Critical Care & Emergency Medicine', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u"Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, Brisbane, Queensland, 4006, Australia", u'University of Queensland School of Medicine, Brisbane, Queensland, 4006, Australia', u'The Wesley Hospital, Brisbane, Queensland, 4066, Australia', u'The Wesley Research Institute, Brisbane, Queensland, 4066, Australia']]

Although there are many studies which focus on various airway techniques, research regarding difficult LMA placement is limited, particularly for anesthesiologist trainees. In our retrospective analysis we tried to identify predictive factors of difficult LMA placement in an academic training program.Methods: This retrospective analysis was derived from a research airway database, where data were collected prospectively at the Memorial Hermann Hospital, Texas Medical Center, Houston, TX, USA, from 2008 to 2010. All non-obstetric adult patients presenting for elective surgery requiring general anesthesia, were enrolled in this study: anesthesiology residents primarily managed the airways. The level of difficulty, number of attempts, and type of the extraglottic device placement were retrieved.Results: Sixty-nine unique Laryngeal Mask Airways (uLMAs) were utilized as a primary airway device.

Grant'], u'20 Apr 2015', u'Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response triggered by microbial infection that can cause cardiovascular collapse, insufficient tissue perfusion and multi-organ failure. The cation channel transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) is expressed in vascular endothelium and causes vasodilatation, but excessive TRPV4 activation leads to profound hypotension and circulatory collapse - key features of sepsis pathogenesis. We hypothesised that loss of TRPV4 signaling would protect against cardiovascular dysfunction in a mouse model of sepsis (endotoxaemia).Multi-parameter monitoring of conscious systemic haemodynamics (by radiotelemetry probe), mesenteric microvascular blood flow (laser speckle contrast imaging) and blood biochemistry (iSTAT blood gas analysis) was carried out in wild type (WT) and TRPV4 knockout (KO) mice. Endotoxaemia was induced by a single intravenous injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 12.5 mg/kg) and systemic haemodynamics monitored for 24 h. Blood flow recording was then conducted under terminal anaesthesia after which blood was obtained for haematological/biochemical analysis. No significant differences were observed in baseline haemodynamics or mesenteric blood flow. Na\xefve TRPV4 KO mice were significantly acidotic relative to WT counterparts. Following induction of sepsis, all mice became significantly hypotensive, though there was no significant difference in the degree of hypotension between TRPV4 WT and KO mice. TRPV4 KO mice exhibited a higher sepsis severity score. While septic WT mice became significantly hypernatraemic relative to the na\xefve state, this was not observed in septic KO mice. Mesenteric blood flow was inhibited by topical application of the TRPV4 agonist GSK1016790A in na\xefve WT mice, but enhanced 24 h following LPS injection. Contrary to the initial hypothesis, loss of TRPV4 signaling (either through gene deletion or pharmacological antagonism) did not attenuate sepsis-induced cardiovascular dysfunction: in fact, pathology appeared to be modestly exaggerated in mice lacking TRPV4.

Because cellular sequelae and adaptive processes may be shared in both circumstances, high altitude exposure (\u2018physiological hypoxia\u2019) assists in the exploration of the response to pathological hypoxia. We therefore studied the response of healthy participants to progressive hypobaric hypoxia at altitude. The primary objective of the study was to identify differences between high altitude inhabitants (Sherpas) and lowland comparators.Methods: We performed an observational cohort study of human responses to progressive hypobaric hypoxia (during ascent) and subsequent normoxia (following descent) comparing Sherpas with lowlanders. Studies were conducted in London (35m), Kathmandu (1300m), Namche Bazaar (3500m) and Everest Base Camp (5300m). Of 180 healthy volunteers departing from Kathmandu, 64 were Sherpas and 116 were lowlanders. Physiological, biochemical, genetic and epigenetic data were collected. Core studies focused on nitric oxide metabolism, microcirculatory blood flow and exercise performance. Additional studies performed in nested subgroups examined mitochondrial and metabolic function, and ventilatory and cardiac variables.\xa0Of the 180 healthy participants who left Kathmandu, 178 (99%) completed the planned trek.

[u'Emerging strategies to prevent heart failure after myocardial infarction', ['Thomas R. Cimato'], u'04 Feb 2015', u'Congestive heart failure (CHF) remains a significant cause of death and disability in industrialized countries. Projections show that the prevalence of CHF will increase 46% from 2012 to 2030, resulting in over eight million adults with CHF in the United States. While substantial advances have been achieved in the treatment of CHF over the past two decades, CHF rivals cancer as a cause of mortality. Strategies focused on prevention of CHF should be emphasized to meaningfully impact the projected increase in CHF. Irrespective of the type of CHF, either systolic or diastolic, coronary artery disease has supplanted hypertension as the most prevalent cause for congestive heart failure, with a high rate of mortality and future hospitalizations. Since coronary artery disease plays a central role in the development of CHF, approaches to treat coronary artery disease and identification of patients at risk for recurrent myocardial infarction (RMI) are approaches to prevent development of CHF.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Subjects who sustain recurrent MI represent a particularly high-risk group for development of CHF. Despite the evolution of therapy for MI from thrombolytic therapy to primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), RMI occurs in ~ 10% of patients in the first year after first MI, and 3 years after their first MI. In this review I explore emerging approaches to prevent RMI including the rationale for recent trials of complete revascularization at the time of MI, newly emerging biomarkers that have additive predictive value for identifying patients with high risk of CHF and death when using existing biomarkers. Finally, the paradigm of hematopoietic stem cell mobilization in MI leading to monocyte expansion and acceleration of atherosclerosis is discussed as an emerging approach to identify patients at high risk of RMI, CHF, and death after MI.', u'/articles/4-37/v1', ['Cardiopulmonary & Vascular Disorders', 'Critical Care & Emergency Medicine'], [u'School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Clinical and Translational Research Center, State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, 14203, USA']]

Its magnitude can be augmented by inactivation-defective mutations, myocardial ischemia, or prolonged exposure to chemical compounds leading to drug-induced (di)-long QT syndrome, and results in an increased susceptibility to cardiac arrhythmias. Using CytoPatch\u2122 2 automated patch-clamp equipment, we performed whole-cell recordings in HEK293 cells stably expressing human Nav1.5, and measured the late Na+ component as average current over the last 100 ms of 300 ms depolarizing pulses to -10 mV from a holding potential of -100 mV, with a repetition frequency of 0.33 Hz. Averaged values in different steady-state experimental conditions were further corrected by the subtraction of current average during the application of tetrodotoxin (TTX) 30 \u03bcM. We show that ranolazine at 10 and 30 \u03bcM in 3 min applications reduced the late Na+ current to 75.0 \xb1 2.7% (mean \xb1 SEM, n = 17) and 58.4 \xb1 3.5% (n = 18) of initial levels, respectively, while a 5 min application of veratridine 1 \u03bcM resulted in a reversible current increase to 269.1 \xb1 16.1% (n = 28) of initial values.

We present the rare case of a woman with both RAE and panniculitis associated with anticardiolipin antibodies in the setting of antiphospholipid syndrome (APLS).\xa0Case description: A female in her forties presented for a second opinion of lumps in her skin. The first lump was noted on her right thigh four years prior to presentation, and biopsy demonstrated longstanding septal and lobular panniculitis. Studies that followed this finding revealed a diagnosis of APLS, and the patient had been placed on 400 mg per day of hydroxychloroquine and a daily low-dose of aspirin.

[u'Effect of anesthesia level on murine cardiac function', ['Fabien Picard', 'Francois Depret', 'Sergio Zanotti-Cavazzoni', 'Steven Hollenberg'], u'22 Jul 2014', u'Background: Echocardiography allows for sensitive and non-invasive assessment of cardiac function in mice, but requires sedation and immobility, which influences cardiac performance. Minimizing the hemodynamic effects of anesthesia is extremely important for improving the applicability of animal models to the clinical setting. We sought to evaluate the effects of isoflurane dose on myocardial function in a murine model.Methods: Twelve healthy C57BL/6 mice were studied with three different isoflurane anesthesia regimens: deep anesthesia with an objective of heart rate (HR) between 350 and 400 beats per minute (bpm), light anesthesia with an objective of HR between 475 and 525 bpm and just before the mice woke up (>575 bpm). Using a high-resolution ultrasound system, stroke volume, cardiac output, left ventricle dimension and fractional shortening were recorded.Results: Fractional shortening was not statistically different in the awake group and the light anesthesia group (49\xb15% in awake mice vs. 48\xb15%; p=0.62), whereas it was different compared to the deep anesthesia group (31\xb15%, p<0.0001 compared to both groups). Similar results were found for stroke volume (41.4\xb15.8 ml vs. 41.6\xb16.9 ml; p=0.81 and 35\xb18.3 ml; p<0.05 compared to both groups). Cardiac output was slightly lower in the light anesthesia group compared to the awake group (21.9\xb13.6 ml/min vs. 25.6\xb13.3; p=0.02) due to HR significant difference (522\xb117 bpm vs. 608\xb123 bpm; p<0.0001).Conclusions: Doppler echocardiography can be performed under very light anesthesia using small doses of isoflurane without influencing cardiac inotropic function.

It is traditionally defined as a triad of acute renal failure, hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia that occur within a week after prodromal hemorrhagic enterocolitis. Severe cases can also be presented by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), toxic megacolon with ileus, pancreatitis, central nervous system (CNS) disorders and multiple organ failure (MOF).Case presentation: A previously healthy 4-year old Caucasian girl developed acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia following a short episode of abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea. By the end of the first week the diagnosis of the typical HUS was established. During the second week the disease progressed into MOF that included ileus, pancreatitis, hepatitis, coma and ARDS, accompanied by hemodynamic instability and extreme leukocytosis. Nonetheless, the girl made a complete recovery after one month of the disease. She was successfully treated in the intensive care unit and significant improvement was noticed after plasmapheresis and continuous veno-venous hemodialysis.Conclusions: Early start of plasmapheresis and meticulous supportive treatment in the intensive care unit, including renal placement therapy, may be the therapy of choice in severe cases of HUS presented by MOF.

A 37 year-old female patient was diagnosed with acromegaly on the basis of typical clinical, hormonal and image characteristics. She presented also with one of the most common co-morbidities \u2013 arterial hypertension. The patient has been regularly followed-up and after three surgical interventions, irradiation and adjuvant treatment with a dopamine agonist, acromegaly was finally controlled in 2008 (20 years after diagnosis). Arterial hypertension however, remained a therapeutic problem even after prescription of four antihypertensive drugs. She had normal biochemical parameters, except for low potassium levels 3.2 (3.5-5.6) mmol/l. This raised the suspicion of primary hyperaldosteronism, confirmed by a high aldosterone to plasma rennin activity ratio, high aldosterone level after a Captopril challenge test and visualization of a 35 mm left adrenal nodule on a CT scan. After an operation, the patient recovered from hypokalemia and antihypertensive therapy was reduced to a small dose of a Ca blocker.Co-morbid arterial hypertension is common in acromegaly, though it is rare for this to be caused by Conn\u2019s adenoma.

[u'CETP inhibitors and cardiovascular disease: Time to think again', ['Norman E Miller'], u'10 Jun 2014', u'Inhibition of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) lowers plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration and raises high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, suggesting it might prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD). From the outset, however, the concept has been controversial owing to uncertainty about its effects on HDL function and reverse cholesterol transport (RCT). Although there has long been good evidence that CETP inhibition reduces atherosclerosis in rabbits, the first information on CETP as a CVD risk factor in a prospectively followed cohort was not published until after the first Phase 3 trial of a CETP inhibitor had begun. The worrying finding that CVD incidence was related inversely to plasma CETP has since been reproduced in each of five further prospective cohort studies. Similar results were obtained in subjects on or off statin therapy, for first and second CVD events, and for mortality as well as CVD morbidity. Additionally, two recent studies have found alleles of the CETP gene that lower hepatic CETP secretion to be associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction. Meanwhile, CETP gene transfer in mice was found to increase RCT from peripheral macrophages in vivo, and human plasma with high CETP activity was shown to have a greater capacity to remove cholesterol from cultured cells than plasma with low activity. This mounting evidence for a protective function of CETP has been given remarkably little attention, and indeed was not mentioned in several recent reviews. \xa0It appears to show that CETP inhibition does not test the HDL hypothesis as originally hoped, and raises a pressing ethical issue regarding two Phase 3 trials of inhibitors, involving more than forty thousand subjects, which are currently in progress. As the weight of evidence now clearly supports an adverse effect of CETP inhibition on CVD, an urgent review is needed to determine if these trials should be discontinued.', u'/articles/3-124/v1', ['Cardiopulmonary & Vascular Disorders'], [u'Magdalen College, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX1 4AU, UK']]

EIAH might be related to the \u201ccardiac fatigue\u201d caused by endurance training. The goal of this study was to examine whether there is any relationship between EIAH and left ventricular hypertrophy in Ironman-triathletes.Methods: We used echocardiography and spiroergometry to determine the left ventricular mass (LVM), the aerobic/anaerobic thresholds and the steady-state blood pressure of 51 healthy male triathletes. The main inclusion criterion was the participation in at least one middle or long distance triathlon.Results: When comparing triathletes with LVM <220g\xa0 and athletes with LVM >220g there was a significant difference between blood pressure values (BP) at the anaerobic threshold (185.2\xb1 21.5 mmHg vs. 198.8 \xb122.3 mmHg, p=0.037).

At the center of the theory is the observation that the acute relationships between arterial pressure and urine production\u2014the acute pressure-diuresis and pressure-natriuresis curves\u2014physiologically adapt to perturbations in pressure and/or changes in the rate of salt and volume intake. These adaptations, modulated by various interacting neurohumoral mechanisms, result in chronic relationships between water and salt excretion and pressure that are much steeper than the acute relationships. While the view that renal function is the dominant controller of arterial pressure has been supported by computer models of the cardiovascular system known as the \u201cGuyton-Coleman model\u201d, no unambiguous description of a computer model capturing chronic adaptation of acute renal function in blood pressure control has been presented.

[u'Regulation of CYP3A genes by glucocorticoids in human lung cells', ['Jessica K Roberts', 'Chad D Moore', 'Erin G Romero', 'Robert M Ward', 'Garold S Yost', 'Christopher A Reilly'], u'08 Oct 2013', u'Inhaled glucocorticoids are the first-line treatment for patients with persistent asthma.\xa0 However, approximately thirty percent of patients exhibit glucocorticoid insensitivity, which may involve excess metabolic clearance of the glucocorticoids by CYP3A enzymes in the lung.\xa0 CYP3A4, 3A5, and 3A7 enzymes metabolize glucocorticoids, which in turn induce CYP3A genes.\xa0 However, the mechanism of CYP3A5 mRNA regulation by glucocorticoids in lung cells has not been determined.\xa0 In hepatocytes, glucocorticoids bind to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which induces the expression of the constitutive androstane receptor or pregnane X receptor; both of which bind to the retinoid X receptor alpha, leading to the induction of CYP3A4, 3A5, and 3A7.\xa0 There is also evidence to suggest a direct induction of CYP3A5 by GR activation in liver cells. In this study, these pathways were evaluated as the mechanism for CYP3A5 mRNA induction by glucocorticoids in freshly isolated primary tracheal epithelial, adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial (A549), immortalized bronchial epithelial (BEAS-2B), primary normal human bronchial/tracheal epithelial (NHBE), primary small airway epithelial (SAEC), and primary lobar epithelial lung cells. In A549 cells, beclomethasone 17-monopropionate ([M1]) induced CYP3A5 mRNA through the glucocorticoid receptor. CYP3A5 mRNA induction by five different glucocorticoids was attenuated by inhibiting the glucocorticoid receptor using ketoconazole, and for beclomethasone dipropionate, using siRNA-mediated knock-down of the glucocorticoid receptor. The constitutive androstane receptor was not expressed in lung cells. SAEC cells, a primary lung cell line, expressed CYP3A5, but CYP3A5 mRNA was not induced by glucocorticoid treatment despite evaluating a multitude of cell culture conditions. None of the other lung cells expressed CYP3A4, 3A5 or 3A7 mRNA. These studies demonstrate that CYP3A5 mRNA is induced by glucocorticoids in A549 cells via the glucocorticoid receptor, but that additional undefined regulatory processes exist in primary lung cells.', u'/articles/2-173/v2', ['Cardiopulmonary & Vascular Disorders', 'Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, University of Utah, Salt Lake City UT, 84112, USA', u'Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of Utah, Salt Lake City UT, 84108, USA']]
[u'Co-implanting orthotopic tissue creates stroma microenvironment enhancing growth and angiogenesis of multiple tumors', ['Per Borgstrom', 'Phil Oh', 'Malgorzata Czarny', 'Brian Racine', 'Jan E Schnitzer'], u'29 Aug 2013', u'Tumor models are needed to study cancer. Noninvasive imaging of tumors under native conditions in vivo is critical but challenging. Intravital microscopy (IVM) of subcutaneous tumors provides dynamic, continuous, long-term imaging at high resolution. Although popular, subcutaneous tumor models are often criticized for being ectopic and lacking orthotopic tissue microenvironments critical for proper development. Similar IVM of orthotopic and especially spontaneous tumors is seldom possible. Here, we generate and characterize tumor models in mice for breast, lung, prostate and ovarian cancer by co-engrafting tumor spheroids with orthotopic tissue in dorsal skin window chambers for IVM. We use tumor cells and tissue, both genetically engineered to express distinct fluorescent proteins, in order to distinguish neoplastic cells from engrafted tissue. IVM of this new, two-colored model reveals classic tumor morphology with red tumor cell nests surrounded by green stromal elements. The co-implanted tissue forms the supportive stroma and vasculature of these tumors. Tumor growth and angiogenesis are more robust when tumor cells are co-implanted with orthotopic tissue versus other tissues, or in the skin alone. The orthotopic tissue promotes tumor cell mitosis over apoptosis. With time, tumor cells can adapt to new environments and ultimately even grow better in the non-orthotopic tissue over the original orthotopic tissue. These models offer a significant advance by recreating an orthotopic microenvironment in an ectopic location that is still easy to image by IVM. These \u201cectopic-orthotopic\u201d models provide an exceptional way to study tumor and stroma cells in cancer, and directly show the critical importance of microenvironment in the development of multiple tumors.', u'/articles/2-129/v2', ['Cardiopulmonary & Vascular Disorders', 'Oncology & Hematology', 'Urology, Gynecology & Obstetrics'], [u'Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, 10905 Road to the Cure, San Diego, CA, 92121, USA', u'Proteogenomics Research Institute for Systems Medicine, 11107 Roselle St, San Diego, CA, 92121, USA']]

Since normal pulmonary function values for healthy non-smoking South Indian adults are available through previously published studies, the pulmonary function test (PFT) values from the study group were compared with the predicted values after corrections for age and anthropometry. The pulmonary functions of the conservancy workers were significantly lower than their predicted values. Moreover, the pulmonary functions declined with increasing years of working. Among both the groups of conservancy workers, the pulmonary functions were significantly lower in sweepers than loaders (P<0.01).

A number of novel imaging modalities have been developed but they are still in the initial stages of development and serious drawbacks obstruct them from offering their benefits to the medical field. In the 21st century, it is believed that nanotechnology will highly influence our everyday life and dramatically change the world of medicine, including medical imaging. Here we discuss how nanotechnology, which is still in its infancy, can improve Terahertz (THz) imaging, an emerging imaging modality, and how it may find its way into real clinical applications. THz imaging is characterised by the use of non-ionising radiation and although it has the potential to be used in many biomedical fields, it remains in the field of basic research. An extensive review of the recent available literature shows how the current state of this emerging imaging modality can be transformed by nanotechnology. Innovative scientific concepts that use nanotechnology-based techniques to overcome some of the limitations of the use of THz imaging are discussed.

[u'Nephron filtration rate and proximal tubular fluid reabsorption in the Akita mouse model of type I diabetes mellitus', ['Jurgen Schnermann', 'Mona Oppermann', 'Yuning Huang'], u'11 Mar 2013', u'An increase of glomerular filtration rate (hyperfiltration) is an early functional change associated with type I or type II diabetes mellitus in patients and animal models. The causes underlying glomerular hyperfiltration are not entirely clear. There is evidence from studies in the streptozotocin model of diabetes in rats that an increase of proximal tubular reabsorption results in the withdrawal of a vasoconstrictor input exerted by the tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) mechanism. In the present study, we have used micropuncture to assess single nephron function in wild type (WT) mice and in two strains of type I diabetic Ins2+/- mice in either a C57Bl/6 (Akita) or an A1AR-/- background (Akita/A1AR-/-) in which TGF is non-functional. Kidney glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of anesthetized mice was increased by 25% in Akita mice and by 52% in Akita/A1AR-/-, but did not differ between genotypes when corrected for kidney weight. Single nephron GFR (SNGFR) measured by end-proximal fluid collections averaged 11.8 \xb1 1 nl/min (n=17), 13.05 \xb1 1.1 nl/min (n=23; p=0.27), and 15.4 \xb1 0.84 nl/min (n=26; p=0.009 compared to WT; p=0.09 compared to Akita) in WT, Akita, and Akita/A1AR-/- mice respectively. Proximal tubular fluid reabsorption was not different between WT and diabetic mice and correlated with SNGFR in all genotypes. We conclude that glomerular hyperfiltration is a primary event in the Akita model of type I diabetes, perhaps driven by an increased filtering surface area, and that it is ameliorated by TGF to the extent that this regulatory system is functional.', u'/articles/2-83/v1', ['Cardiopulmonary & Vascular Disorders', 'Hepatology & Nephrology', 'Endocrinology & Gastroenterology', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, NIH, Bethesda, MD, 20892, USA', u"Children's Hospital, University Medical Center, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany"]]

We describe a case of severe asthma with respiratory acidosis in a 10-year-old patient unresponsive to multipharmacologic broncholytic therapy. Only the initiation of sevoflurane inhalation resolved severe bronchoconstriction and dynamic hyperinflation, leading to complete recovery.Case presentation: A 10-year-old Caucasian boy was intubated and mechanically ventilated due to an asthmatic attack. Bronchoconstriction and dynamic hyperinflation were severe while multipharmacological broncholytic therapy was unsuccessful. Inhalation with sevoflurane via an anaesthesia machine was the key intervention leading to gradual resolving of severe hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis. Furthermore bilateral pupil dilation occurred during hypercapnia, but no intracranial pathology could be detected. The patient made an uneventful recovery. To our knowledge this is the first case where hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis were so profound and long lasting yet the patient survived without any damage.Conclusions: Inhalational anaesthetics must be considered as an early treatment option in ventilated asthmatic patients with bronchial obstruction unresponsive to conventional therapy even though their administration in intensive care units may be difficult.', u'/articles/1-56/v1', ['Cardiopulmonary & Vascular Disorders', 'Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases', 'Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry', 'Critical Care & Emergency Medicine', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'Department of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care, Sozialmedizinisches Zentrum Ost-Donauspital, Langobardenstr. 122, Vienna, Austria', u'Department of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care, Otto-Wagner-Spital, Sanatoriumsstrasse 1, 1140 Vienna, Austria']]

MicroRNAs are detected in extracellular locations such as plasma; however, the extent of miRNA expression in plasma its relation to cardiovascular disease is not clear and many clinical studies have utilized array-based platforms with poor reproducibility.Methods and Results: Initially, to define distribution of miRNA in human blood; whole blood, platelets, mononuclear cells, plasma, and serum from 5 normal individuals were screened for 852 miRNAs using high-throughput micro-fluidic quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). In total; 609, 448, 658, 147, and 178 miRNAs were found to be expressed in moderate to high levels in whole blood, platelets, mononuclear cells, plasma, and serum, respectively, with some miRNAs uniquely expressed. To determine the cardiovascular relevance of blood miRNA expression, plasma miRNA (n=852) levels were measured in 83 patients presenting for cardiac catheterization. Eight plasma miRNAs were found to have over 2-fold increased expression in patients with significant coronary disease (\u226570% stenosis) as compared to those with minimal coronary disease (less than 70% stenosis) or normal coronary arteries. Expression of miR-494, miR-490-3p, and miR-769-3p were found to have significantly different levels of expression. Using a multivariable regression model including cardiovascular risk factors and medications, hsa-miR-769-3p was found to be significantly correlated with the presence of significant coronary atherosclerosis.Conclusions: This study utilized a superior high-throughput qRT-PCR based method and found that miRNAs are found to be widely expressed in human blood with differences expressed between cellular and extracellular fractions.

Patients with OSA have a higher rate of postoperative complications. We investigated if patients with OSA undergoing laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery have an increased risk of postoperative respiratory events. In this observational study we examined the data of 89 consecutive patients undergoing gastric bypass surgery.Methods: All patients scheduled for gastric bypass surgery between 7/28/2010 and 02/15/2011 were enrolled and managed according to our routine clinical protocol (48 with OSA / 41 without OSA (NOSA)). Depending on the patient\u2019s preoperative compliance with CPAP therapy, they were further assigned into a compliant (OSAc) and noncompliant (OSAn) group. A respiratory event was defined as a deviation from the regular postoperative management.Results: Both OSA and NOSA groups were similar based on clinical characteristics and narcotic consumption. Fourteen patients (29.2%) suffered from a respiratory event in the OSA group and 8 patients (19.5%) in the NOSA group (p=0.29). Patients compliant with continuous positive airway pressure CPAP had a similar complication rate to patients without OSA (p=0.96). 53.8% of patients with OSA that were noncompliant with CPAP therapy (OSAn) had a respiratory event in the direct postoperative period. This is statistically significant in comparison to patients diagnosed with OSA that are compliant with CPAP (OSAc) (p=0.03)Conclusion: It may be beneficial to encourage OSA patients to use CPAP preoperatively to reduce postoperative respiratory events.

OA represents one of the most common causes of physical disability in the world. Different OA treatments are usually considered in relation to the stage of the disease. In the early stages, it is possible to recommend physical activity programs that can maintain joint health and keep the patient mobile, as recommended by OA Research Society International (OARSI) and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR). In the most severe and advanced cases of OA, surgical intervention is necessary. After, in early postoperative stages, it is essential to include a rehabilitation exercise program in order to restore the full function of the involved joint. Physical therapy is crucial for the success of any surgical procedure and can promote recovery of muscle strength, range of motion, coordinated walking, proprioception and mitigate joint pain. Furthermore, after discharge from the hospital, patients should continue the rehabilitation exercise program at home associated to an appropriate diet.

[u'Primary Hyperparathyroidism', ['Leonardo Bandeira', 'John Bilezikian'], u'04 Jan 2016', u'Over the past several generations, primary hyperparathyroidism (PHTP) has undergone a change in its clinical presentation in many countries from a symptomatic disease to an asymptomatic one. The reasons for this change in clinical presentation are related to the widespread use of biochemical screening tests, to the measurement of PTH more routinely in the evaluation of metabolic bone disease and to the status of vitamin D sufficiency in the population. Along with recognition of a broader clinical spectrum of disease, including a more recently recognized normocalcemic variant, has come an appreciation that the evaluation of classic target organs that can be affected in PHPT, such as the skeleton and the kidneys, require more advanced imaging technology for complete evaluation. It is clear that even in asymptomatic patients, evidence for microstructural disease in the skeleton and calcifications in the kidneys can be demonstrated often. Potential non-classical manifestations of PHPT related to neurocognition and the cardiovascular system continue to be of interest. As a result of these advances, revised guidelines for the management of asymptomatic PHPT have been recently published to help the clinician determine whether surgery is appropriate or whether a more conservative approach is acceptable.', u'/articles/5-1/v1', ['Bone Disorders', 'Eye Disorders & ENT', 'Endocrinology & Gastroenterology', 'Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry', 'Urology, Gynecology & Obstetrics'], [u'Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA']]

Old randomized studies supported the use of regional anesthesia with fewer postoperative pulmonary and thromboembolic complications, and this has been supported by recent large non-randomized epidemiological database cohort studies.

[u'Viscoelastic Properties of Hyaluronan in Physiological Conditions', ['Mary K. Cowman', 'Tannin A. Schmidt', 'Preeti Raghavan', 'Antonio Stecco'], u'25 Aug 2015', u'Hyaluronan (HA) is a high molecular weight glycosaminoglycan of the extracellular matrix (ECM), which is particularly abundant in soft connective tissues. Solutions of HA can be highly viscous with non-Newtonian flow properties. These properties affect the movement of HA-containing fluid layers within and underlying the deep fascia. Changes in the concentration, molecular weight, or even covalent modification of HA in inflammatory conditions, as well as changes in binding interactions with other macromolecules, can have dramatic effects on the sliding movement of fascia. The high molecular weight and the semi-flexible chain of HA are key factors leading to the high viscosity of dilute solutions, and real HA solutions show additional nonideality and greatly increased viscosity due to mutual macromolecular crowding. The shear rate dependence of the viscosity, and the viscoelasticity of HA solutions, depend on the relaxation time of the molecule, which in turn depends on the HA concentration and molecular weight. Temperature can also have an effect on these properties. High viscosity can additionally affect the lubricating function of HA solutions. Immobility can increase the concentration of HA, increase the viscosity, and reduce lubrication and gliding of the layers of connective tissue and muscle. Over time, these changes can alter both muscle structure and function. Inflammation can further increase the viscosity of HA-containing fluids if the HA is modified via covalent attachment of heavy chains derived from Inter-\u03b1-Inhibitor. Hyaluronidase hydrolyzes HA, thus reducing its molecular weight, lowering the viscosity of the extracellular matrix fluid and making outflow easier. It can also disrupt any aggregates or gel-like structures that result from HA being modified. Hyaluronidase is used medically primarily as a dispersion agent, but may also be useful in conditions where altered viscosity of the fascia is desired, such as in the treatment of muscle stiffness.', u'/articles/4-622/v1', ['Bone Disorders', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'Biomatrix Research Center, Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Polytechnic School of Engineering, New York University, New York, NY, 10010, USA', u'Faculty of Kinesiology & Schulich School of Engineering - Centre for Bioengineering Research & Education, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, T2N 1N4, Canada', u'Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Rusk Rehabilitation, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY, 10016, USA', u'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Padova, Padua, 35100, Italy']]

Study objectives were to determine the variability of proximal femur size and geometry in primary cTHA patients and correlate them with patient demographics and body mass index (BMI).Methods: Medical records of 127 consecutive primary cTHA patients were reviewed retrospectively. The demographic (ethnicity, sex, age) and BMI data were collected. Intertrochanteric (IT) distance, inner/outer proximal femur diameters and cortical thickness for the subtrochanteric (ST) and cortical diaphyseal (DP) regions were measured from anteroposterior radiographs. Descriptive statistics were used to correlate patient demographics and BMI with radiographic measurements.Results: The study included 96 cTHA patients (mean age 60 years, range 22-91 years; 34 females; 72 Caucasian, 18 Black, and six Hispanic) with four underweight; 13 normal; 34 overweight, and 45 obese BMI. No correlation existed for patient age or race with radiographic measurements. Males had significantly larger proximal femur dimensions and cortical thickness than females. No BMI correlations existed for IT distance; BMI was directly proportional to outer diameter and cortical thickness in ST and DP regions, and inversely proportional to inner diameter in these regions.Discussion: Greater proximal femur size appears to correlate with gender, but not with age or race. Larger subtrochanteric and diaphyseal outer diameters are significantly associated with higher BMI. A trend exists for larger subtrochanteric and diaphyseal inner diameters to be associated with lower BMI. These findings may have implications for optimal cTHA femoral component design.', u'/articles/4-161/v1', ['Bone Disorders'], [u'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery and Rehabilitation, The University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX, 77555-0165, USA']]

Whereas the recent incidence of annual passenger vehicle fatalities in the United States of America (USA) has progressively declined, motorcycle fatalities have steadily increased in the past 11 years. Although motorcycle injuries (MIs) have been studied, to the author\u2019s knowledge there are no published reports on MIs in the USA during this 11-year period.Methods: Study data were derived from a prospectively collected Level I trauma center database. Data sampling included motorcycle crash injury evaluations for the 10-year period ending on 31 August 2008. This retrospective analysis included patient demographic and medical data, helmet use, Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score, injury severity score (ISS), length of hospital stay (LOS), specific injury diagnosis, and death. Data statistics were analyzed using the Spearman correlation coefficient, Kruskal-Wallis tests, and logistic regression.Results: The study identified 1252 motorcycle crash injuries. Helmets were worn by 40.7% of patients for which helmet data were available. The rates of the most common orthopedic injuries were tibia/fibula (19.01%), spine (16.21%), and forearm (10.14%) fractures. The most common non-orthopedic motorcycle crash injuries were concussions (21.09%), skull fractures (8.23%), face fractures (13.66%), and hemo- and pneumothorax (8.79%). There was a significant correlation between greater age and higher ISS (r=0.21, P<0.0001) and longer LOS (r=0.22, P<0.0001). Older patients were also less likely to wear a helmet (OR=0.99, 95% CI: 0.98, 0.997), associated with a significantly higher risk for death (after adjustment for helmet use OR=1.03, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.05). All patients without helmets had a significantly lower GCS score (P=0.0001) and a higher mortality rate (after adjustment for patient demographic data OR=2.28, 95% CI: 1.13, 4.58).\xa0Conclusion: Compared with historical reports, the prevalence of skull, face, spine, and pelvis fractures have increased in American motorcycle crashes.

[u'Periprosthetic bone loss: diagnostic and therapeutic approaches', ['Loredana Cavalli', 'Maria Luisa Brandi'], u'17 Jun 2014', u'Total joint replacement surgery is being performed on an increasingly large part of the population. Clinical longevity of implants depends on their osseointegration, which is influenced by the load, the characteristics of the implant and the bone-implant interface, as well as by the quality and quantity of the surrounding bone. Aseptic loosening due to periprosthetic osteolysis is the most frequent known cause of implant failure. Wear of prosthetic materials results in the formation of numerous particles of debris that cause a complex biological response. Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) is regarded as an accurate method to evaluate Bone Mineral Density (BMD) around hip or knee prostheses. Further data may be provided by a new device, the Bone Microarchitecture Analysis (BMA), which combines bone microarchitecture quantification and ultra high resolution osteo-articular imaging. Pharmacological strategies have been developed to prevent bone mass loss and to extend implant survival. Numerous trials with bisphosphonates show a protective effect on periprosthetic bone mass, up to 72 months after arthroplasty. Strontium ranelate has been demonstrated to increase the osseointegration of titanium implants in treated animals with improvement of bone microarchitecture and bone biomaterial properties.', u'/articles/2-266/v2', ['Bone Disorders'], [u'Department of Surgery and Translational Medicine, University of Florence, Florence, 50139, Italy']]

She had tender cervical lymphadenopathy. Two days after admission, her condition worsened with venous congestion of the face and neck, throbbing headache, dyspnea and she developed seizures. Very soon, she developed pericarditis with cardiogenic shock and required adrenaline support. Lymph node biopsy confirmed Kikuchi\u2019s disease. The possibility of superior vena cava (SVC) obstruction due to mediastinal lymphadenopathy was considered and treated with steroids following which the child showed a dramatic improvement.

It is genetically transmitted in some cases and is often associated with syndromes, such as Nail-Patella syndrome, antecubital pterygium and ulnar dysplasia. About two thirds are posterior, with the remainder being either anterior (15%) or lateral (15%). The natural history of the condition is that symptoms are relatively benign, with only some limitation of motion and deformity. Treatment either involves early attempts at reconstruction or delayed intervention at skeletal maturity with radial head excision. We evaluated the radiographic and functional results of a two-in-one procedure (radial shortening and open reduction) in the treatment of congenital dislocation of the radial head of an eight year old girl.Objective: To describe a technique for easy reduction and maintenance of normal radiocapitellar joint anatomy in cases of congenital dislocation of the radial head.Method: We have introduced one modification to the Sachar\u2019s method of open reduction by adding radial shortening. This can be described as a \u2018two incision approach\u2019 with the first incision for the radial shortening and the second for the open reduction of the radiocapitellar joint. The radial shaft was osteotomised first before we performed the radial head relocation. Then the overlapping part of radial shaft was trimmed. It was stabilized with a transarticular K wire fixation.Results: At one year follow up, the elbow is stable with no valgus or fixed flexion deformity. Supination has increased to 40 degrees from zero degrees. An X-ray showed reformation of the radial head with good congruity of the radiocapitellar joint and correction of the radial bow.Conclusion: As far as the authors are aware, this is the first report of congenital dislocation of the radial head being treated by radial shortening and open reduction of radiocapitellar joint through a two incision approach (two-in-one approach).

[u'Surface arthroplasty in a cerebral palsied patient with hip dysplasia and dislocation', ['Carlos G. Rubin', 'Pablo G. Rubin'], u'20 Jan 2014', u'Hip dysplasia is considered to be an etiological factor in the progress of developmental osteoarthrosis of the hip. In patients with cerebral palsy, hip dislocation plus other anatomical alterations such as acetabular dysplasia, coxa valga, excessive femoral anteversion and muscle imbalance can be factors leading to coxarthrosis and pain. Total hip arthroplasty is a valuable method of treatment in some of these patients. However, sometimes young age, bone anatomy and shape, and the possible lack of stability of conventional designs in the context of big surgeries with multiple muscle releases and possible osteotomies make this arthroplasty a very difficult indication to reproduce as a surgeon. Hip resurfacing is a good option because it preserves as much bone stock as possible, doesn\u2019t need corrective osteotomies and gives the prosthesis improved stability. The main concern about this type of prosthesis is the suspected lower survival rate of the femoral component, compared with regular total hip arthroplasties. We present a cerebral palsied patient with hip dysplasia who underwent resurfacing surgery.

The aim of this study was to determine whether non-toxic concentrations of curcumin can reduce interleukin-1beta (IL-1\u03b2)-stimulated inflammation and catabolism in an explant model of cartilage inflammation.Methods: Articular cartilage explants and primary chondrocytes were obtained from equine metacarpophalangeal joints. Curcumin was added to monolayer cultured primary chondrocytes and cartilage explants in concentrations ranging from 3\u03bcM-100\u03bcM. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3 release into the secretome of IL-1\u03b2-stimulated explants was measured using a competitive ELISA and western blotting respectively. Proteoglycan (PG) release in the secretome was measured using the 1,9-dimethylmethylene blue (DMMB) assay. Cytotoxicity was assessed with a live/dead assay in monolayer cultures after 24 hours, 48 hours and five days, and in explants after five days.Results: Curcumin induced chondrocyte death in primary cultures (50\u03bcM p<0.001\xa0and 100\u03bcM p<0.001) after 24 hours.

This review provides a summary of data from both non-randomized and randomized clinical studies of botulinum toxin in back pain and various osteoarticular conditions, including osteoarthritis, tennis elbow, low back pain and hand pain. Three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of small sizes provide evidence of short-term efficacy of a single intra-articular injection of 100 units of botulinum toxin A (BoNT/A) for the relief of pain and the improvement of both function and quality of life in patients with chronic joint pain due to arthritis. Three RCTs studied intramuscular BoNT/A for tennis elbow with one showing a significant improvement in pain relief compared with placebo, another one showing no difference from placebo, and the third finding that pain and function improvement with BoNT/A injection were similar to those obtained with surgical release. One RCT of intramuscular BoNT/A for low back pain found improvement in pain and function compared to placebo. Single RCTs using local injections of BoNT in patients with either temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain or plantar fasciitis found superior efficacy compared to placebo. One RCT of intramuscular BoNT/B in patients with hand pain and carpal tunnel syndrome found improvement in pain in both BoNT/B and placebo groups, but no significant difference between groups.

Optimal post-operative pain relief remains a challenge due to considerable variations in the level of pain experienced between individuals. Our aim was to examine whether the preoperative electrical pain threshold was a strong predictor of elevated postoperative pain levels following arthroscopic subacromial decompression (ASD) surgery. Methods: Forty consenting patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade 1-2 presenting for elective ASD surgery were recruited. Patients\u2019 electrical pain thresholds were measured preoperatively using a PainMatcher\xae\xa0(Cefar Medical AB, Lund, Sweden) device. Following surgery under general anaesthesia, the maximum pain experienced at rest and movement was recorded using a visual analogue scale until the end of postoperative day four. Results: In univariate analyses (t-test), the postoperative pain experienced (Area Under Curve) was significantly greater in patients with a low pain threshold as compared with a high pain threshold at both rest (mean 12.5, S.E. 1.7 v mean 6.5, S.E.1.2.

Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived mesoangioblasts may provide the solution to this problem. Although, the idea of using iPSC-derived cell therapies has been proposed for quite some time, our understanding of how the immune system interacts with these cells is inadequate. Herein, we show that iPSC-derived mesoangioblasts (HIDEMs) from healthy donors and, importantly, limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 2D patients exert immunosuppressive effects on T cell proliferation.\xa0 Interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) play crucial roles in the initial activation of HIDEMs and importantly indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE-2) were identified as key mechanisms involved in HIDEM suppression of T cell proliferation.

Patients often engage in progressive rehabilitative programs, and surgical intervention may be required in severe cases. Autologous platelet rich plasma (PRP) injections have been growing in popularity in musculoskeletal medicine as an alternative to corticosteroid injections. This paper looks at the effectiveness of PRP injections in glenoid labral lesions.Methods: The clinical and radiological findings are presented for two patients who have been treated with autologous PRP into the glenohumeral joint adjacent to the labral tear, in conjunction with a progressive rehabilitative program. Follow up occurred at 18 months and 13 months, respectively.Results: Both subjects tolerated the PRP injection well with no adverse effects, and were compliant with their rehabilitative programs. On initial presentation, pain on the visual analogue scale (VAS) was 7/10 and 6/10 and at follow up it was reported as 0/10. Both subjects have now returned to normal sporting and work activities.Conclusions: The findings from this case series suggest that PRP in conjunction with appropriate rehabilitation can assist in the clinical recovery of glenoid labral tears.

[u'Does vitamin D deficiency contribute to post-burn bone loss?', ['Gordon L Klein'], u'28 Nov 2012', u'Burn injury results in the acute loss of bone as well as the development of progressive vitamin D deficiency. Bone loss occurs acutely due to resorption, which is then followed by apoptosis of osteoblasts preventing repair of the bone loss. The acute resorption is due to a combination of the inflammatory response and the stress response to the burn injury. The resultant production of inflammatory cytokines and endogenous glucocorticoids initially stimulate the osteoblasts to produce RANK ligand, which stimulates marrow stem cell differentiation into osteoclasts. As the stress response persists for approximately one year post-burn the glucocorticoids produced by the body will cause osteoblast apoptosis and adynamic bone, impairing the ability of bone to recover its resorptive losses. The vitamin D deficiency is due to the failure to supplement the diet of burn patients with vitamin D on discharge from hospital and to failure of the skin to make normal quantities of vitamin D on sunlight exposure. Because the bone resorption can be prevented by the acute administration of bisphosphonates it is unlikely that vitamin D deficiency is responsible for the early-onset bone loss following burns. However, because a deficit in trabecular bone remains for at least two years post-burn, it is possible that vitamin D deficiency prevents the recovery of trabecular bone density over the long term.', u'/articles/1-57/v1', ['Bone Disorders', 'Endocrinology & Gastroenterology'], [u'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery and Rehabilitation and Shriners Burns Hospital, University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, Galveston, 77555 TX, USA']]

Primary hypoparathyroidism presenting for the first time as seizures in adulthood is quite infrequent. Patients may present with hypocalcemic seizures even in the absence of subtle hypocalcemic signs.Case report: A 30 year old male, was presented to the emergency facility in an unconscious condition. He was intubated on the way to the hospital as he had suffered from two episodes of ventricular tachycardia. He had previous history of recurrent seizures for 6 years inspite of multiple anticonvulsants including phenytoin sodium, sodium valproate, and levetiracetam. The seizure frequency increased in the last year and he would have 5-6 episodes/ month. A MRI brain scan and EEG at the onset were both normal, as was the general examination but he had history of bilateral cataracts. There were no signs of tetany. Investigations revealed a normal hemoglobin and glucose level with normal electrolytes and both TLC and DLC levels were also normal. He had a serum calcium level of 3.3 mg% with a serum parathyroid hormone level of 1pg/ml, serum 25(OH) vitamin D levels of 6.6ng/ml and hypomagnesemia. NCCT head scan showed bilateral basal ganglia, and deep white matter calcification.Conclusions: 1) Ironically, increasing reliance on high end investigations such as a MRI brain scan could lead to certain conditions being missed; conditions that could be easily identifiable by the humble CT scan. 2) All treatable metabolic conditions should be excluded at first before commencing with anticonvulsants; this will restrict patients from burdensome polytherapy and related side effects.', u'/articles/1-51/v1', ['Bone Disorders', 'Endocrinology & Gastroenterology', 'Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry', 'Urology, Gynecology & Obstetrics'], [u'Department of Neurology, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, New Delhi, India']]

[u'A divide-and-conquer strategy in tumor sampling enhances detection of intratumor heterogeneity in routine pathology: A modeling approach in clear cell renal cell carcinoma', ['Jose I. Lopez', 'Jesus M. Cortes'], u'22 Mar 2016', u'Intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) is an inherent process in cancer development which follows for most of the cases a branched pattern of evolution, with different cell clones evolving independently in space and time across different areas of the same tumor. The determination of ITH (in both spatial and temporal domains) is nowadays critical to enhance patient treatment and prognosis. Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) provides a good example of ITH. Sometimes the tumor is too big to be totally analyzed for ITH detection and pathologists decide which parts must be sampled for the analysis. For such a purpose, pathologists follow internationally accepted protocols. In light of the latest findings, however, current sampling protocols seem to be insufficient for detecting ITH with significant reliability. The arrival of new targeted therapies, some of them providing promising alternatives to improve patient survival, pushes the pathologist to obtain a truly representative sampling of tumor diversity in routine practice. How large this sampling must be and how this must be performed are unanswered questions so far. \xa0Here we present a very simple method for tumor sampling that enhances ITH detection without increasing costs. This method follows a divide-and-conquer (DAC) strategy, that is, rather than sampling a small number of large-size tumor-pieces as the routine protocol (RP) advises, we suggest sampling many small-size pieces along the tumor. We performed a computational modeling approach to show that the usefulness of the DAC strategy is twofold: first, we show that DAC outperforms RP with similar laboratory costs, and second, DAC is capable of performing similar to total tumor sampling (TTS) but, very remarkably, at a much lower cost. We thus provide new light to push forward a shift in the paradigm about how pathologists should sample tumors for achieving efficient ITH detection.', u'/articles/5-385/v1', ['Public Health & Epidemiology', 'Oncology & Hematology', 'Urology, Gynecology & Obstetrics'], [u'Department of Pathology, Cruces University Hospital, Biocruces Research Institute, University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Barakaldo, Spain', u'Quantitative Biomedicine Unit, Biocruces Research Institute, Barakaldo, Spain', u'Ikerbasque: The Basque Foundation for Science, Bilbao, Spain', u'Department of Cell Biology and Histology, University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Leioa, Spain']]

We define scale up as the expansion and extension of delivery or access to an innovation for all end users in a jurisdiction who will benefit from it.ResultsSixty nine articles were eligible for review. Frequently described stages in the innovation process and contextual issues that influence progress through each stage were mapped. 16 stages were identified: 12 deliberation and 4 action stages. Included papers suggest that innovations progress through stages of maturity and the uptake of innovation depends on the innovation aligning with the interests of 3 critical stakeholder groups (innovators, end users and the decision makers) and is also influenced by 3 broader contexts (social and physical environment, the health system, and the regulatory, political and economic environment).

Its trend has been declining in recent years because of improvement in the management of acute diarrhea, which represents the ideal strategy to prevent prolonged diarrhea. The pathogenesis of prolonged diarrhea is multifactorial and essentially based on persistent mucosal damage due to specific infections or sequential infections with different pathogens, host-related factors including micronutrient and/or vitamin deficiency, undernutrition and immunodeficiency, high mucosal permeability due to previous infectious processes and nutrient deficiency with consequential malabsorption, and microbiota disruption. Infections seem to play a major role in causing prolonged diarrhea in both developing and developed areas. However, single etiologic pathogens have not been identified, and the pattern of agents varies according to settings, host risk factors, and previous use of antibiotics and other drugs. The management of prolonged diarrhea is complex. Because of the wide etiologic spectrum, diagnostic algorithms should take into consideration the age of the patient, clinical and epidemiological factors, and the nutritional status and should always include a search for enteric pathogens. Often, expensive laboratory evaluations are of little benefit in guiding therapy, and an empirical approach may be effective in the majority of cases.

It responds to constructive social interactions and to personal growth. If an individual\u2019s PAP is nurtured to develop further, it likely will contribute much more to health than without fostering. It may also compensate for losses of the BGP.

A major new development in this understanding is the recognition that pet exposures consist of not only allergen exposures but also changes in microbial exposures.

[u'Overactive bladder', ['Karen M. Wallace', 'Marcus J. Drake'], u'07 Dec 2015', u'Overactive bladder syndrome is highly prevalent, and increasingly so with aging. It is characterized by the presence of urinary urgency, and can be associated with incontinence, increased voiding frequency, and nocturia. Assessment needs to exclude serious medical disorders that might present with similar symptoms, and a bladder diary is an invaluable part of understanding the presentation. Initial management is conservative, comprising education, bladder training, and advice on fluid intake. Drug therapy options include antimuscarinic medications and beta-3 adrenergic receptor agonists. Persistent overactive bladder syndrome, despite initial therapy, requires a review of the patient\u2019s understanding of conservative management and compliance, and adjustment of medications. For refractory cases, specialist review and urodynamic testing should be considered; this may identify detrusor overactivity or increased filling sensation, and needs to exclude additional factors, such as stress incontinence and voiding dysfunction. Botulinum neurotoxin-A bladder injections can be used in severe overactivity, provided the patient is able and willing to do intermittent self-catheterisation, which is necessary in about 5% of treated patients.

A large number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain severe dengue disease. As discussed, few of them attempt to explain why severe disease occurs under the two different immunological settings. New experimental evidence has demonstrated that DENV non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is toll-receptor 4 agonist that stimulates primary human myeloid cells to produce the same cytokines observed during the course of severe dengue disease. In addition, NS1 directly damages endothelial cells. These observations have been repeated and extended to an in vivo mouse model.

However, given that the majority of these associated variants reside in non-coding genomic regions, their predicted cis and trans-regulatory functions remain largely undefined. Here we show that correlation between human diseases and traits can follow geographical distribution of human populations, and that the underlying mechanism is at least partly genetically based. We report two Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) GWAS variants (rs7903146 and rs12255372) in the TCF7L2 locus that regulate expression in skin tissues but not lymphoblastoid or adipose tissues, of the KITLG gene that encodes an important regulator of melanogenesis and light hair color in European populations. We also report extensive binding events of TCF7L2 protein in the promoter region, immediate upstream region and first intron of the KITLG gene, which supports a trans-interaction between TCF7L2 and KITLG. We further show that both light hair color and T2D genetic variants are correlated with geographic latitude. Taken together, our observations suggest that natural variation in transcription factor loci in European human populations may be an underlying and confounding factor for the geographical correlation between human phenotypes, such as type 2 diabetes and light hair color. We postulate that transcription factor regulation may confound the correlation between seemingly diverse human traits.

[u'Caveat emptor NICE: biased use of cost-effectiveness is inefficient and inequitable', ['Jack Dowie', 'Mette Kjer Kaltoft', 'Jesper Bo Nielsen', 'Glenn Salkeld'], u'16 Oct 2015', u"Concern with the threshold applied in cost-effectiveness analyses by bodies such as NICE distracts attention from their biased use of the principle. The bias results from the prior requirement that an intervention be effective (usually 'clinically effective') before its cost-effectiveness is considered. The underlying justification for the use of cost-effectiveness as a criterion, whatever the threshold adopted, is that decisions in a resource-constrained system have opportunity costs. Their existence rules out any restriction to those interventions that are 'incrementally cost-effective' at a chosen threshold and requires acceptance of those that are 'decrementally cost-effective' at the same threshold. Interventions that fall under the linear ICER line in the South-West quadrant of the cost-effectiveness plane are cost-effective because they create net health benefits, as do those in the North-East quadrant. If there is objection to the fact that they are cost-effective by reducing effectiveness as well as costs, it is possible to reject them, but only on policy grounds other than their failure to be cost-effective. Having established this, the paper considers and seeks to counter the arguments based on these other grounds. Most notably these include those proposing a different threshold in the South-West quadrant from the North-East one, i.e. propose a 'kinked ICER'.

Differential microRNA expression has been used to aid diagnosis and discriminate disease stages. The accuracy and reliability of microRNA expression measurement is of utmost importance. Quantification of microRNA expression in human peripheral blood is commonly detected using total RNA extracted via different methods. To date, no convincing data are available showing whether microRNA quantification results can be influenced by the use of total RNA extracted from whole blood or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). This study examined miR-146a-5p and miR-155-5p expression using total RNA extracted in parallel from whole blood and PBMCs of 14 healthy volunteers. The data showed that the quantification of miRNA using total RNA extracted from whole blood varied from that of PBMCs, indicating that the miRNA expression was a result of all the different cell-types present in whole blood.

[u'The possible importance of income and education as covariates in cohort studies', ['Norman Temple'], u'07 Sep 2015', u'Background:\xa0 Many cohort studies have been carried out that have provided information on the relationship between diet and health-related outcomes. Omission of important covariates during multivariate analysis may give rise to error due to residual confounding. A possibly important covariate is socioeconomic status (SES) as this is related to both diet and health.Methodology:\xa0 An analysis was carried out of 76 randomly selected papers from 66 cohort studies. The papers covered many dietary variables and a wide variety of diseases/health-related outcomes. The cohort studies were carried out in many different locations and the subjects varied widely in age.Results:\xa0 Approximately two-thirds of the papers (65.8%) used at least one measure of SES as a covariate. Education was used most often (60.5% of papers), followed by income (14.4%) and social class (2.6%). More than one measure of SES was used in 11.8% of papers.Conclusions:\xa0 Failure to include income (or another measure of present SES, such as occupation) may therefore be a common source of error in cohort studies. Failure to include education may be particularly important as it is likely to be a weaker measure of present SES than is income. There is a need for more research on this question. SES in childhood is almost never included in multivariate analysis in cohort studies carried out on adults. This could also play a significant role in disease risk in middle age or later.

Despite the great advancement in deciphering the clinical course of the virus, specific mechanisms favoring Ebolavirus pathogenicity and transmission, and which genomic structures are most antigenic, are still to be clearly delineated. This study used functional protein phylogenetic analysis, pathway designs and antigenic epitope predictions to respectively; identify viral genomic regions closely related to host proteins, predict protein/genetic interactions favoring viral pathogenesis and identify frequency of MHC class I & II immune related host peptide variants whose transmission intensity value favors disease epidemicity. Viral glycoprotein (VGP) presented the highest genetic variation and though captured on the network with matrix protein (MXP), no direct interaction was observed. The majority of host interacting proteins presented with kinase functions, particularly a protein-signaling role observed in LCK, a Tyrosine-protein kinase with the most dominant interactions and viral related functions implicated in disease shock events. Four VGP and three MXP main antigenic epitopes identified, differentially showed high frequency to two MHC class I types. The same pattern was observed for VGP and MXP antigenic epitopes predicted to MHC class II allele variants, favoring high transmission intensity values within the host population, suggesting their involvement in Ebola epidemic upsurges. Related Ebola species with high transmission values were dominantly non-Zaire Ebolaviruses whose antigenic regions showed several repeats, implicating them in viral antigenic variations. Our analysis show that VGP and MXP are both critical for viral entry and pathogenicity in the host and with their species specific occurrence, their combined role in drug/vaccine design is critical.

The aim of this study was to audit the first year of routine syphilis screening in the same population and reassess the trends in HIV rates.Methods: From August 2012 to July 2013, 3600 pregnant women were screened for HIV (ELISA) and syphilis (VDRL with TPHA confirmation) at clinics along the Thai-Myanmar border.Results: Seroprevalence for HIV 0.47% (95% CI 0.30-0.76) (17/3,599), and syphilis 0.39% (95% CI 0.23-0.65) (14/3,592), were low. Syphilis was significantly lower in refugees (0.07% 95% CI 0.01-0.38) (1/1,469), than in migrants (0.61% 95% CI 0.36-1.04) (13/2,123).

Biomarker databases are met with scepticism. The reasons for this lack of faith come from different directions: lack of integrity of the biospecimen and meta-analysis of data derived from biospecimen prepared in various ways cause incoherence and false indications. Although the trend for antibody-independent assays is on the rise, demand for consistent performance of antibodies (both in choice of antibody and how to apply it in the correct dilution where applicable) in immune assays remains unmet in too many cases. Quantitative assays suffer from a lack of world-wide accepted criteria when the immune assay is not ELISA-based. Finally, statistical analysis suffer from coherence both in the way software packages are being scrutinized for mistakes in the script and remaining invisible after small-scale analysis, and in the way appropriate queries are fed into the packages in search for output that is fit for the types of data put in.

The main requirement for an OAm to be effective is the adequate retention on the teeth while the patient is asleep. We evaluated the retentive forces of a new low-cost, customizable, titratable, thermoplastic OAm (BluePro\xae; BlueSom, France). Dental impressions and casts were made for one patient with complete upper and lower dental arches including the third molars and class II bite proportions. A setup based on Frasaco ANA-4 models was also used. Two protrusive positions of the mandible were investigated: 3 mm and 8 mm, representing respectively 25% and 65% of the maximal protrusion. The forces required to remove the BluePro\xae device from the carriers were recorded continuously over 730 cycles (=365 days, twice a day) to simulate 1 year of clinical use. At 8 mm protrusion the BluePro\xae device showed retentive forces of ~27N. There was a slight but non-significant decrease in retentive forces in the tests on the epoxified carriers which was not found on the ANA-4 carriers. There were no significant differences between the carriers as a function of protrusion. The BluePro\xae device tested in the present study possesses sufficient retention forces to resist initial jaw opening forces and full mouth opening forces estimated to be ~20N. It could therefore broaden the indications for use of thermoplastic OAms. It could provide a temporary OAm while a custom-made OAm is being manufactured or repaired.

This expected feature of a competitive market has not been studied within states, however. We tested the hypothesis that insurance premiums decrease in more competitive geographic rating areas within states in the U.S.A.Methodology/principle findings: This cross-sectional study utilized publicly available premiums from the Federal Health Insurance Exchange website, www.healthcare.gov. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to model premiums based on the number of insurers in geographic rating areas. The relationship between premiums and the number of insurers competing in a geographic rating area was also calculated for each unique insurance plan offered on the exchange. The data set and statistical code used for this research is linked in the publication. We found that there was an unexpected, marginally positive relationship between average monthly premiums and the number of insurers in a geographic rating area (+$5.71 in monthly premiums per additional insurer, p<0.001). We also found that identical plans tend to be offered with marginally higher premiums in rating areas with more insurers (+$3.18 in monthly premiums per additional insurer, p=0.002), contrary to the relationship we expected from a competitive marketplace. The principle limitation of the study is that this unexpected relationship, which suggests a lack of competitiveness of this early market, could be due to unobserved confounding factors that influence pricing in more competitive rating areas.Conclusion: On the Federal Health Insurance Exchange, the price of insurance is higher in more competitive rating areas within states.

The presence of homeostasis or the shift from homeostasis of an adult human/mammal system can be described by equation that takes into account energy and informational input and output, catabolism and anabolism, oxidation and reduction, and entropy, where changes in the input should equal changes in the output within a specific period of time. Catabolism and oxidation are presented on the input side since the drive of the surroundings is to decompose and oxidize living systems, i.e. systems are under constant 'catabolic and oxidative pressure'.

Industry-wide trends have revealed that the traditional drug discovery research and development (R&D) model is no longer viable, and drug companies are evolving their approach. Rather than only pursue blockbuster therapeutics for heterogeneous, common diseases, drug companies have increasingly begun to shift their focus to rare diseases. In academia, advances in genetics analyses and disease mechanisms have allowed scientific understanding to mature, but the lack of funding and translational capability severely limits the rare disease research that leads to clinical trials. Simultaneously, there is a movement towards increased research collaboration, more data sharing, and heightened engagement and active involvement by patients, advocates, and foundations. The growth in networks and social networking tools presents an opportunity to help reach other patients but also find researchers and build collaborations. The growth of collaborative software that can enable researchers to share their data could also enable rare disease patients and foundations to manage their portfolio of funded projects for developing new therapeutics and suggest drug repurposing opportunities. Still there are many thousands of diseases without treatments and with only fragmented research efforts. We will describe some recent progress in several rare diseases used as examples and propose how collaborations could be facilitated.

Among the mechanisms implicated are hormonal systems such as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which produces cortisol in humans. Current research employs speech stressors and social rejection stressors to understand hormonal responses in a laboratory setting. However, it is not clear whether social rejection stressors elicit hormonal reactivity. In addition to cortisol, progesterone has been highlighted as a potential stress- and affiliation-related hormone in humans. In the present study, 131 participants (70 men and 61 women) were randomly assigned to be exposed to one of four conditions: standardized speech stressor; speech control; social rejection task; or a control (inclusion) version of the social rejection task. Saliva samples were collected throughout the study to measure cortisol and progesterone. As hypothesized, we found the expected increase in cortisol in the speech stressor, and we also found that the social rejection task did not increase cortisol, underscoring the divergence between unpleasant experiences and HPA axis activity. However, we did not find evidence for progesterone increase either during the speech- or social rejection tasks.

We examined four classes of ADRs associated with treatment of dementia by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs): known reactions (gastrointestinal, psychological disturbances), potential reactions (respiratory disturbance), novel reactions (hepatic, hematological disturbances), and death.Methods: Our cohort design linked drug utilization data to medical claims from Utah Medicaid recipients. We restricted the analysis to 50 years-old and older beneficiaries diagnosed with dementia-related diseases. We compared patients treated with AChEI to patients untreated with anti-dementia medication therapy. We attempted to remove confounding by establishing propensity-score-matched cohorts for each outcome investigated; we then evaluated the effects of drug treatment by conditional multivariable Cox-proportional-hazard regression. Acute and transient effects were evaluated by a crossover design using conditional logistic regression.Results: Propensity-matched analysis of expected reactions revealed that AChEI treatment was associated with gastrointestinal episodes (Hazard Ratio [HR]: 2.02; 95%CI: 1.28-3.2), but not psychological episodes, respiratory disturbance, or death. Among the unexpected reactions, the risk of hematological episodes was higher (HR: 2.32; 95%CI: 1.47-3.6) in patients exposed to AChEI. AChEI exposure was not associated with an increase in hepatic episodes. We also noted a trend, identified in the case-crossover design, toward increase odds of experiencing acute hematological events during AChEI exposure (Odds Ratio: 3.0; 95% CI: 0.97 - 9.3).Conclusions: We observed an expected association between AChEIs treatment and gastrointestinal disturbances and detected a signal of possible hematological ADR after treatment with AChEIs in this pilot study.

Additionally, 70% of patients received at least one additional antibiotic; over 25 different medications were used in various combinations.Conclusions:\xa0 Patients receiving 2 g of ceftriaxone may require fewer intensive care days and may enjoy an improved survival compared to those receiving 1 g daily.

Arnold', 'Sean Ekins'], u'22 Apr 2014', u"Approximately 1 in 2500 Americans suffer from Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease. The underlying disease mechanisms are unique in most forms of CMT, with many point mutations on various genes causing a toxic accumulation of misfolded proteins. Symptoms of the disease often present within the first two decades of life, with CMT1A patients having reduced compound muscle and sensory action potentials, slow nerve conduction velocities, sensory loss, progressive distal weakness, foot and hand deformities, decreased reflexes, bilateral foot drop and about 5% become wheelchair bound. In contrast, the ultra-rare disease Giant Axonal Neuropathy (GAN) is frequently described as a recessively inherited condition that results in progressive nerve death. GAN usually appears in early childhood and progresses slowly as neuronal injury becomes more severe and leads to death in the second or third decade. There are currently no treatments for any of the forms of CMTs or GAN. We suggest that further clinical studies should analyse electrical impedance myography as an outcome measure for CMT. Further, additional quality of life (QoL) assessments for these CMTs are required, and we need to identify GAN biomarkers as well as develop new genetic testing panels for both diseases. We propose that using the Global Registry of Inherited Neuropathy (GRIN) could be useful for many of these studies. Patient advocacy groups and professional organizations (such as the Hereditary Neuropathy Foundation (HNF), Hannah's Hope Fund (HHF), The Neuropathy Association (TNA) and the American Association of Neuromuscular and Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM) can play a central role in educating clinicians and patients.

To our knowledge, no previous study has explored the potential utility of this technology for the detection and quantification of tumor cells in ascitic fluid samples. Herein we report a case of metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma in a 70-year-old man presenting with dysphagia and a large amount of fluid in the peritoneal cavity. Analysis of a peripheral blood sample and ascites sample with the CellSearch\xae technology both revealed the presence of putative tumor cells that were positive for epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) and cytokeratin (CK) expression. This study confirmed the hematogenous dissemination of esophageal cancer by the detection of circulating tumor cells in the peripheral blood, and is the first to demonstrate that tumor cells can be identified in ascitic fluid by using CellSearch\xae technology.', u'/articles/3-12/v1', ['Public Health & Epidemiology', 'Endocrinology & Gastroenterology', 'Oncology & Hematology'], [u'CHU Nancy, Nancytomique, Laboratoire d\u2019Immunologie, P\xf4le Laboratoires, Vandoeuvre l\xe8s Nancy, France and Universit\xe9 Henri Poincar\xe9, Facult\xe9 de M\xe9decine, EA4369 RHEM and UMR7039 CRAN-CNRS, Vand\u0153uvre-l\xe8s-Nancy, France', u'Service D\u2019Anatomie et Cytologie Pathologiques, CHU Nancy-Brabois, Vand\u0153uvre-l\xe8s-Nancy, France']]
[u'Creating Minimum Harm Practice (MiHaP): a concept for continuous improvement', ['Ranjit Singh'], u'17 Dec 2013', u'The author asks for the attention of leaders and all other stakeholders to calls of the World Health Organization (WHO), the Institute of Medicine (IOM), and the UK National Health Service (NHS) to promote continuous learning to reduce harm to patients. This paper presents a concept for structured bottom-up methodology that enables and empowers all stakeholders to identify, prioritize, and address safety challenges. This methodology takes advantage of the memory of the experiences of all persons involved in providing care. It respects and responds to the uniqueness of each setting by empowering and motivating all team members to commit to harm reduction. It is based on previously published work on \u201cBest Practices Research (BPR)\u201d and on \u201cSystematic Appraisal of Risk and Its Management for Error Reduction (SARAIMER)\u201d. The latter approach, has been shown by the author (with Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) support), to reduce adverse events and their severity through empowerment, ownership and work satisfaction.

Treatment options include conservative care, transplantation, and dialysis. Major alternative dialysis modalities include peritoneal dialysis (PD) and in-center hemodialysis (ICHD), which have been shown to produce similar outcomes and survival. The need to provide dialysis treatment for patients with ESRD represents a significant financial challenge for global health care systems. Changes in clinically-appropriate dialysis delivery leading to more efficient use of resources would increase health systems\u2019 ability to meet that challenge. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the economic literature of PD and ICHD within the context of continued economic uncertainty and pressure on healthcare resource use.Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted for studies published between 2004 and 2012.\xa0 Articles are included if they were original research studies in English which reported costs and/or cost effectiveness associated with PD and ICHD.Results: Twenty-four articles are included in our review, six of which are cost effectiveness studies comparing PD and ICHD.Conclusions: Our findings echo those of prior published reviews, showing that PD is significantly cost-saving compared to ICHD therapy in most developed countries and some developing countries.

A recent study has found that an \u2018abstinence-only\u2019 sexual education programme is effective in reducing sexual activity among adolescents. Knowledge of abstinence-only sexual education and preparedness for practice as an effective tool for promotion of sexual health among Nigerian secondary school adolescents was studied. An analytic descriptive survey design was used for the study. The research population comprised of all public secondary schools in three southern geopolitical zones of the Niger Delta Region of Nigeria. A multistage sampling technique was used to select 2020 senior secondary school (SS1-SS3) students as sample for the study. A partially self-designed and partially adapted questionnaire from an 'abstinence-only versus comprehensive sex education' debate, from debatepedia (http://wiki.idebate.org/), entitled 'Questionnaire on Nigerian Secondary School Adolescents\u2019 Perspective on Abstinence-Only Sexual Education (QNSSAPAOSE)' was used in eliciting information from respondents. Hypotheses were formulated and tested. Frequency counts, percentage and Pearson Product Moment Correlation were used in analysing data. A greater proportion of secondary school adolescents in this study lacked knowledge of sexual education. About 80% of the respondents could not define sexual education. The general perspective on abstinence-only sexual education was negative, as revealed by the larger number of respondents who demonstrated unwillingness to practice abstinence-only sexual education. Specifically, of those who responded in favour of abstinence-only sexual education, the youngest group of adolescents (11-13 years) and the male respondents were more likely to accept this type of education than the other groups. Poor knowledge of sexual education could be responsible for unwillingness to practice abstinence-only sexual education.

[u'Did the elimination of lead from petrol reduce crime in the USA in the 1990s?', ['Wayne Hall'], u'08 Oct 2013', u'This article assesses the evidence for the hypothesis that a decline in all types of crime since the early 1990s in the USA was a consequence of removing lead from petrol between 1975 and 1985. It describes ecological and econometric studies that have generally but not always found correlations between lead exposures in childhood and some types of crime 20 years later; a small number of epidemiological studies that have found a dose-response relationship between lead exposure in childhood and self-reported and officially recorded criminal offences in young adulthood; and evidence for the biological plausibility of a causal relationship. Lead exposure in childhood may have played a small role in rising and falling crime rates in the USA but it is unlikely to account for the very high percentage of the decline suggested by the ecological studies. The major anomaly in the evidence is that the associations reported in ecological studies are much stronger (explaining 56-90% of the variation in crime rates) than the weaker relationships found in the cohort studies (that typically explain less than 1% of the variance in offending). \xa0Suggestions are made for research that will better assess the contribution that reduced lead exposure has made to declining crime rates in the USA.', u'/articles/2-156/v2', ['Public Health & Epidemiology'], [u'NHMRC Australia, The University of Queensland Centre for Clinical Research, Queensland, Australia']]

[u'The nature and prevalence of chronic pain in homeless persons: an observational study', ['Rebecca Fisher', 'Judith Ewing', 'Alice Garrett', 'E Katherine Harrison', 'Kimberly KT Lwin', 'Daniel W Wheeler'], u'30 Jul 2013', u'Background: Homeless people are known to suffer disproportionately with health problems that reduce physical functioning and quality of life, and shorten life expectancy. They suffer from a wide range of diseases that are known to be painful, but little information is available about the nature and prevalence of chronic pain in this vulnerable group. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of chronic pain among homeless people, and to examine its location, effect on activities of daily living, and relationship with alcohol and drugs.Methods: We conducted face-to-face interviews with users of homeless shelters in four major cities in the United Kingdom, in the winters of 2009-11. Participants completed the Brief Pain Inventory, Short Form McGill Pain questionnaire, Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs, and detailed their intake of prescribed and unprescribed medications and alcohol. We also recorded each participant\u2019s reasons for homelessness, and whether they slept rough or in shelters.Findings: Of 168 shelter users approached, 150 (89.3%) participated: 93 participants (63%) reported experiencing pain lasting longer than three months; the mean duration of pain experienced was 82.2 months. The lower limbs were most frequently affected. Opioids appeared to afford a degree of analgesia for some, but whilst many reported symptoms suggestive of neuropathic pain, very few were taking anti-neuropathic drugs.Interpretation: The prevalence of chronic pain in the homeless appears to be substantially higher than the general population, is poorly controlled, and adversely affects general activity, walking and sleeping. It is hard to discern whether chronic pain is a cause or effect of homelessness, or both.

Our objective is to evaluate the use of an AHP in a simulated committee setting selecting oral medications for type 2 diabetes.\xa0Methods: This study protocol describes the AHP in five sequential steps using a small group of diabetes experts representing various clinical disciplines. The first step will involve defining the goal of the decision and developing the AHP model. In the next step, we will collect information about how well alternatives are expected to fulfill the decision criteria. In the third step, we will compare the ability of the alternatives to fulfill the criteria and judge the importance of eight criteria relative to the decision goal of the optimal medication choice for type 2 diabetes. We will use pairwise comparisons to sequentially compare the pairs of alternative options regarding their ability to fulfill the criteria. In the fourth step, the scales created in the third step will be combined to create a summary score indicating how well the alternatives met the decision goal. The resulting scores will be expressed as percentages and will indicate the alternative medications' relative abilities to fulfill the decision goal. The fifth step will consist of sensitivity analyses to explore the effects of changing the estimates.

[u'I\u2019m Like You, Just Not In That Way: Tag Networks to Improve Collaborative Filtering', ['Jason Boorn', 'Debra S Goldberg'], u'26 Mar 2013', u'Collaborative filtering aims to predict a person\u2019s preferences by examining the preferences of similar people. Many collaborative filtering algorithms rely on a coarse notion of similarity, which assumes that if two people are sufficiently simiar in a few specific areas, each is likely to make good recommendations for the other in most areas. Our trust in the opinions of others, though, is rarely absolute; we often tend to trust recommendations from certain people in certain areas. In this paper we develop an algorithm which reflects this notion. Rather than capturing taste information at the user level, we capture taste at the topic level by making use of tags: arbitrary words or phrases which are often used to group online content. Previous attempts to improve collaborative filtering using tag information have attempted to determine tag meanings, and as a result have depended upon complex semantic analyses. Our algorithm avoids these complications by focusing instead on the clusters which tags establish. Using tags in this way provides a significant improvement in the accuracy of recommendations without a commensurate loss in coverage. These tag clusters also give rise to networks which can be exploited to further improve recommendation results.', u'/articles/2-95/v1', ['Public Health & Epidemiology'], [u'Department of Applied Mathematics, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, 80302, USA']]

Abstract characteristics associated with publication were analysed.Results: There were no differences in overall publication rates, impact factors or time to publication between 1995 and 2005. Overall, basic-science abstracts were twice as likely to achieve full publication than non-basic science.

We investigated the relationship between political preferences and mortality in Poland around the time of the last three general elections.Methods: We used the electoral data from the general elections held in 2001, 2005 and 2007. Indicators of political ideological preference were constructed based on the percentage of votes gathered by each party. Data on mortality, education and income level were obtained from 2002-2007 from the Polish Central Statistical Office. Pearson correlation was computed between standardised mortality ratios (SMR) and political preference. Finally, the influence of political preference on SMR was examined in a multivariate analysis controlling for socio-economic factors.Results: SMR was positively correlated with liberal political views (0.26; p<0.05) and negatively correlated with both secondary education (-0.49; p<0.05) and monthly income (-0.239; p<0.05). The correlation between SMR and conservative political views was negative, although the result did not reach statistical significance. Education and income explained more of the variation in SMR than political views. In a multivariate regression, the liberal views factor and secondary education were significantly associated with the SMR (p<0.001 for both).Conclusion: Our findings are consistent with earlier studies conducted in western countries showing a positive correlation between liberal political ideology and SMR, but differ in that an inverse relationship was found between conservative political orientation with education and income.

[u'Correlating data from different sensors to increase the positive predictive value of alarms: an empiric assessment', ['Yuval Bitan', 'Michael F OConnor'], u'08 Nov 2012', u'Objectives: Alarm fatigue from high false alarm rate is a well described phenomenon in the intensive care unit (ICU). Progress to further reduce false alarms must employ a new strategy. Highly sensitive alarms invariably have a very high false alarm rate. Clinically useful alarms have a high Positive-Predictive Value. Our goal is to demonstrate one approach to suppressing false alarms using an algorithm that correlates information across sensors and replicates the ways that human evaluators discriminate artifact from real signal.Methods: After obtaining IRB approval and waiver of informed consent, a set of definitions, (hypovolemia, left ventricular shock, tamponade, hemodynamically significant ventricular tachycardia, and hemodynamically significant supraventricular tachycardia), were installed in the monitors in a 10 bed cardiothoracic ICU and evaluated over an 85 day study period. The logic of the algorithms was intended to replicate the logic of practitioners, and correlated information across sensors in a way similar to that used by practitioners. The performance of the alarms was evaluated via a daily interview with the ICU attending and review of the tracings recorded over the previous 24 hours in the monitor. True alarms and false alarms were identified by an expert clinician, and the performance of the algorithms evaluated using the standard definitions of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value.Results: Between 1 and 221 instances of defined events occurred over the duration of the study, and the positive predictive value of the definitions varied between 4.1% and 84%.Conclusions: Correlation of information across alarms can suppress artifact, increase the positive predictive value of alarms, and can employ more sophisticated definitions of alarm events than present single-sensor based systems.', u'/articles/1-45/v1', ['Public Health & Epidemiology', 'Critical Care & Emergency Medicine'], [u'Cognitive Technologies Laboratory, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA', u'Department of Anesthesia and Critical Care, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA']]

Unfortunately, endoscopic procedures, widely regarded as uncomfortable, face low patient compliance, thus underscoring the need for reliable biological markers capable of detection of tumor growth in bodily fluids. Furthermore, in light of the emerging patient-friendly, still devoid of histopathological capabilities, capsule endoscopy, gastric fluid may prove valuable for biomarker-assisted cancer diagnosis. We set out to determine whether CA72-4 measurement in gastric fluid may be of benefit for detection of gastric cancer.Design: Open prospective study.Setting: Sample collection was performed at a tertiary referral center for patients with gastroenterological diseases; immunological analysis was performed at the R&D facility of a commercial biotechnology company. Studies were part of an EU-FP6 project (NEMO).Patients: 176 patients referred for endoscopy due to gastrointestinal complaints.Interventions: Gastric juice was aspirated endoscopically according to standard operating procedures, volume and pH were measured immediately and samples stored at -80\xb0C.Outcome measures: Concentration of CA72-4 tumor marker was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).Results: Median CA72-4 levels were about 4-fold higher in cancer patients compared with patients with normal gastric findings, gastric inflammation, intestinal metaplasia or other diseases (p=0.001). Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that elevated CA72-4 was significantly predicted by gastric carcinoma adjusted for H. pylori status, age, smoking status, PPI dose, and pH of aspirate (R2=0.27, p<0.0001). In this model, diagnosis of gastric carcinoma had by far the greatest influence. At a cut-off level of 100 U/ml, CA72-4 had 75% sensitivity and 89% specificity for detection of gastric cancer.Conclusions: Based on our findings, CA72-4 level assessment in gastric fluid, featuring yet unmatched accuracy of malignant neoplasia detection may prove beneficial for gastric cancer screening.', u'/articles/1-33/v1', ['Public Health & Epidemiology', 'Endocrinology & Gastroenterology', 'Oncology & Hematology'], [u'Gastrointestinal Laboratory, Department of Internal Medicine, Israelitic Hospital, Hamburg, Germany', u'Novamed ltd, Jerusalem, 91531, Israel']]

Data collection was done by electronic records of blood donors.Materials and Methods: The study was conducted retrospectively at a tertiary care hospital in western India. All those who donated whole blood between 1st January 2011 and 31st March 2011 were included in the study. Data was collected using local blood bank software.Statistical analysis used: No statistical technique used as it is a data article.Results: 60.5% of donors were young, below 30 years of age. Donors were predominantly male (91.6%). Voluntary donors comprised 88% of the donors. Total deferral rate was 22.36%, with 17.29% permanent deferrals and 82.71% temporary deferrals. Main reasons for deferral were anemia 39.42%, low body weight 14.29%, hypertension 10.73%, age below 18 years 10.73% and history of medication 6.09%.

Therefore, without any coordination or pre-existing agreement, research labs at AbbVie, Servier, Pfizer and Alkermes started independent experiments aiming to reproduce and extend published evidence. More than a dozen experiments conducted by these four independent teams failed to detect robust effects of ketamine on markers reported to be affected in the original study by Li et al. (2010).

Hartgerink'], u'11 Apr 2016', u'Ongoing debates surrounding Open Access to the scholarly literature are multifaceted and complicated by disparate and often polarised viewpoints from engaged stakeholders. At the current stage, Open Access has become such a global issue that it is critical for all involved in scholarly publishing, including policymakers, publishers, research funders, governments, learned societies, librarians, and academic communities, to be well-informed on the history, benefits, and pitfalls of Open Access. In spite of this, there is a general lack of consensus regarding the advantages or disadvantages of Open Access at multiple levels. This review aims to to be a resource for current knowledge on the impacts of Open Access by synthesizing important research in three major areas of impact: academic, economic and societal. While there is clearly much scope for additional research, several key trends are identified, including a broad citation advantage for researchers who publish openly, as well as additional benefits to the non-academic dissemination of their work. The economic case for Open Access is less well-understood, although it is clear that access to the research literature is key for innovative enterprises, and a range of governmental and non-governmental services. Furthermore, Open Access has the potential to save publishers and research funders considerable amounts of financial resources. The social case for Open Access is strong, in particular for advancing citizen science initiatives, and leveling the playing field for researchers in developing countries. Open Access supersedes all potential alternative modes of access to the scholarly literature through enabling unrestricted re-use, and long-term stability independent of financial constraints of traditional publishers that impede knowledge sharing. Open Access remains only one of the multiple challenges that the scholarly publishing system is currently facing. Yet, it provides one foundation for increasing engagement with researchers regarding ethical standards of publishing. We recommend that Open Access supporters focus their efforts on working to establish viable new models and systems of scholarly communication, rather than trying to undermine the existing ones as part of the natural evolution of the scholarly ecosystem.

[u'Communities of practice in life sciences and the need for brokering', ['Anne Tierney'], u'04 Mar 2016', u'Etienne Wenger\u2019s work on communities of practice is influential in teaching and learning in higher education. A core work of many postgraduate certificate in teaching and learning (PGCert) courses for new lecturers, it is studied, in the main, as a means to understand how to support and encourage students to achieve more effective learning. Communities of practice can also be applied to academics. In the context of the Research Excellence Framework (REF) and its predecessors, the gulf between research-focused and teaching-Focused academics in life sciences has widened, so that in many institutions, these two groups have evolved into two distinct communities of practice; one whose priority is disciplinary research, the other\u2019s learning and teaching. However, in 2015, the UK government announced that a Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF) would be introduced into higher education in England, as early as 2017. While the exact details of TEF remain unclear, it is certain that \u201cexcellence\u201d and \u201cstudent satisfaction\u201d will be high on the agenda. It is vital, therefore, that the two communities of practice, research-focused and teaching-focused, find ways to come together in order to ensure high quality teaching and learning. Wenger proposes that this can be done through the process of \u201cbrokering\u201d, which allows expertise from both communities of practice to cross from one to the other, strengthening both. This should be encouraged at departmental and institutional level, but another vital origin of brokering can be forged at a(n) (inter)national level at meetings such as the SEB Annual Conference, where teaching-focused academics have the opportunity to mix with research-active colleagues. While this paper is informed by recent and current events in the UK Higher Education sector, it is of interest to academics who work in an environment where research and teaching have become separate to any extent.', u'/articles/5-280/v1', ['Publishing, Education & Communication'], [u'Department of Learning and Teaching, Edinburgh Napier University, Edinburgh, UK']]

In this paper we report the analysis of questionnaire data with a particular focus on pupil perceptions of research in the sciences and of the scientific method. The questionnaire was a 25-item Likert Scale (1-5) distributed to seven collaborating schools. We received 2634 returns from pupils across key stages 3, 4 and 5. We also asked teachers to complete the questionnaire in order to explore how they thought their pupils would respond. We received 54 teacher responses. Statistically significant differences in the responses were identified through a chi-square test on SPSS. As what is being taught influences secondary pupil views on research we also consider how the term \u2018research\u2019 appears in the national curriculum for England and Wales and the three main English exam boards. The main theoretical construct that informs our analysis of the questionnaire data and the national curriculum is Angela Brew\u2019s 4-tier descriptor of perceptions of research (domino, trading, layer, journey). We use this framework in order to map what, when and how research is presented to school pupils in England and Wales. We also use this framework in order to highlight and discuss certain pupil views that emerged from the questionnaire data and which indicate areas where curriculum and pedagogy intervention may be necessary: pupils seem less confident in their understanding of research as involving the identification of a research question; and, they often see research as a means to confirm one\u2019s own opinion. They do however understand research as involving the generation of new knowledge and the collection of new data, such as interviews and questionnaires as well as laboratory work, field trips and library searches and they appear relatively confident in their statements about their ability to do research, their school experiences of research and the importance of research in their future career choice.', u'/articles/4-1442/v2', ['Publishing, Education & Communication'], [u'School of Biological Sciences, University of East Anglia, Norwich, UK', u'Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia, Norwich, UK', u'School of Education and Lifelong Learning, University of East Anglia, Norwich, UK']]

The traditional way of publishing new findings in journals is becoming increasingly outdated and no longer serves the needs of much of science. Whilst preprints can bring significant benefits of removing delay and selection, they do not go far enough if simply implemented alongside the existing journal system. We propose that we need a new approach, an Open Science Platform, that takes the benefits of preprints but adds formal, invited, and transparent post-publication peer review. This bypasses the problems of the current journal system and, in doing so, moves the evaluation of research and researchers away from the journal-based Impact Factor and towards a fairer system of article-based qualitative and quantitative indicators. In the long term, it should be irrelevant where a researcher publishes their findings.

However, who is that explanation for, and how is this explanation communicated once it has been deduced?Scientific research is typically communicated via papers in journals, with an abstract presented as a summary of that explanation. However, in many instances they may be written in a manner which is non-communicatory to a lay reader. This study begins to investigate if poetry could be used as an alternative form of communication, by first assessing if poetic verse is an effective form of communication to other scientists. In order to assess this suitability, a survey was conducted in which two different groups of participants were asked questions based on a scientific abstract. One group of participants was given the original scientific abstract, whilst the second group was instead given a poem written about the scientific study. Quantitative analysis found that whilst a scientific audience found a poetic interpretation of a scientific abstract to be no less interesting or inspiring than the original prose, they did find it to be less accessible. However, further qualitative analysis suggested that the poem did a good job in conveying a similar meaning to that presented in the original abstract. The results of this study indicate that whilst for a scientific audience poetry should not replace the prose abstract, it could be used alongside the original format to inspire the reader to find out more about the topic. Further research is needed to investigate the effectiveness of this approach for a general audience.', u'/articles/5-91/v1', ['Publishing, Education & Communication'], [u'School of Research, Enterprise & Innovation, Manchester Metropolitan University, Manchester, UK']]
[u'Bringing experiential learning into the lecture theatre using 3D printed objects', ['David P. Smith'], u'13 Jan 2016', u'The ability to conceptualize 3D shapes is central to understanding biological processes. The concept that the structure of a biological molecule leads to function is a core principle of the biochemical field. Conceptual teaching usually involves vocal explanations or using two dimensional slides or video presentations. A deeper understanding may be obtained by the handling of objects. 3D printed biological molecules can be used as active learning tools to stimulate engagement in large group lectures. These models can be used to build upon initial core knowledge which can be delivered in either a flipped form or a more didatic manner. Within the teaching session the students are able to learn by handling, rotating and viewing the objects to gain an appreciation of an enzyme\u2019s active site or the structure of DNA for example. Models and other artefacts are handled in small groups and act as a focus for talking points to generate conversation. Through this approach core knowledge is first established and then supplemented with high level problem solving through a "Think-Pair-Share" cooperative learning strategy. The teaching delivery is adjusted based around experiential learning activities by moving the object from mental cognition and into a physical environment leading to student engagement in the lecture theatre and a dialog with the lecturer. The use of artefacts in teaching allows the lecturer to create interactive sessions that challenge and enable the student. This approach can be applied at all levels and across many disciplines.', u'/articles/5-61/v1', ['Publishing, Education & Communication'], [u'School of Bioscience and Chemistry, Sheffield Hallam University, Sheffield, UK']]

However, current reporting practices for research resources are insufficient to allow humans and algorithms to identify the exact resources that are reported or answer basic questions such as \u201cWhat other studies used resource X?\u201d To address this issue, the Resource Identification Initiative was launched as a pilot project to improve the reporting standards for research resources in the methods sections of papers and thereby improve identifiability and reproducibility. The pilot engaged over 25 biomedical journal editors from most major publishers, as well as scientists and funding officials. Authors were asked to include Research Resource Identifiers (RRIDs) in their manuscripts prior to publication for three resource types: antibodies, model organisms, and tools (including software and databases). RRIDs represent accession numbers assigned by an authoritative database, e.g., the model organism databases, for each type of resource. To make it easier for authors to obtain RRIDs, resources were aggregated from the appropriate databases and their RRIDs made available in a central web portal (www.scicrunch.org/resources). RRIDs meet three key criteria: they are machine readable, free to generate and access, and are consistent across publishers and journals. The pilot was launched in February of 2014 and over 300 papers have appeared that report RRIDs. The number of journals participating has expanded from the original 25 to more than 40.

While several medical schools have implemented a review session to help consolidate knowledge acquired during the clerkship, the effects of such an intervention are not yet well-established. An improvement in NBME psychiatry examination scores has previously been reported with a single end-of-clerkship review session, but this was limited by a small sample size and the fact that attendance at the review session was optional, leading to likely selection bias.\xa0Methods: A 1.5-hour structured review session was conducted for medical students in the last week of each 4-week psychiatry clerkship between September 2014 and July 2015. Students were required to attend unless excused due to scheduling conflicts. Scores on the NBME psychiatry subject exam were compared with those of students taking the examination in the corresponding time period in each of the previous two academic years.\xa0Results: 83 students took the exam during the experimental period, while 176 took the exam during the control period. Statistically significant improvements were found in mean score (p=0.03), mean for the two lowest scores in each group (p<0.0007), and percentage of students scoring 70 or less (p=0.03).\xa0Percentage of students achieving the maximum possible score (99) was higher in the experimental group, but did not reach significance (p=0.06).\xa0Conclusions: An end-of-clerkship review session led to increased mean scores on the NBME psychiatry subject examination, particularly for students at the lower end of the score range.

The paper\u2019s aim is to raise awareness of the subject-specific needs of AHSS scholars to help inform the design of future digital tools for impact analysis in AHSS.Firstly, I shall explore the definition of research data and how it is currently understood by AHSS researchers. I will show why many researchers choose not to engage with digital dissemination techniques and ORCID. This discussion must necessarily include the idea that practice-based and applied AHSS research are processes which are not easily captured in numerical \u2018sets\u2019 and cannot be labelled electronically without giving careful consideration to what a group or data item \u2018represents\u2019 as part of the academic enquiry, and therefore how it should be cited and analysed as part of any impact assessment.Then, the paper will explore: the role of the monograph and arts catalogue in AHSS scholarship; how citation practices and digital impact measurement in AHSS currently operate in relation to authorship and how digital identifiers may hypothetically impact on metrics, intellectual property (IP), copyright and research integrity issues in AHSS.I will also show that, if we are to be truly interdisciplinary, as research funders and strategic thinkers say we should, it is necessary to revise the way we think about digital research dissemination.

The questionnaire used was modified from a previous study. Semester of study, gender, nationality, place of residence and occupation of parents were noted. Information about whether students plan to work in rural US/Canada after graduation, possible reasons why doctors are reluctant to work in rural areas, how the government can encourage rural practice, possible problems respondents anticipate while working in rural areas were among the topics studied.Results: Ninety nine of the 108 students (91.7%) participated. Forty respondents were in favor of working in rural US/Canada after graduation. Respondents mentioned good housing, regular electricity, water supply, telecommunication facilities, and schools for education of children as important conditions to be fulfilled.

Here, we propose steps to help increase the transparency of the scientific method and the reproducibility of research results: specifically, we introduce a peer-review oath and accompanying manifesto. These have been designed to offer guidelines to enable reviewers (with the minimum friction or bias) to follow and apply open science principles, and support the ideas of transparency, reproducibility and ultimately greater societal impact. Introducing the oath and manifesto at the stage of peer review will help to check that the research being published includes everything that other researchers would need to successfully repeat the work.

In this study, we test whether an approach linking field observations with predictive models can be useful in allowing students to understand basic numeracy and probability, as well as developing skills in modelling, understanding species interactions and even community/ecosystem-service interactions.\xa0 We presented a field-based lecture in a morning session (on rocky shore ecology), followed by an afternoon session parameterising a belief network using a simple, user-friendly interface. The study was conducted with students during their second week of a foundation degree, hence having little prior knowledge of these systems or models. All students could create realistic predictive models of competition, predation and grazing, although most initially failed to account for trophic cascade effects in parameterising their models of the rocky shore they had previously seen. The belief network was then modified to account for a marine ecosystem management approach, where fishing effort and economic benefit of fishing were linked to population abundance of different species, and management goals were included. Students had little difficultly in applying conceptual links between species and ecosystem services in the same manner as between species. Students evaluated their understanding of a range of variables from rocky shore knowledge to marine management as increasing over the session, but the role of the predictive modelling task was indicated as a major source of learning, even for topics we thought may be better learned in the field. The study adds evidence to the theories that students benefit from exposure to numeric topics, even very early in their degree programmes, but students grasp concepts better when applied to real world situations which they have experience of, or perceive as important.', u'/articles/3-312/v1', ['Publishing, Education & Communication', 'Plant Biology, Ecology & Environmental Sciences'], [u'Department of Life and Environmental Sciences, Bournemouth University, Poole, Dorset, BH12 5BB, UK', u'Department of Animal Conservation and Welfare, Kingston Maurward College, Dorchester, Dorset, DT2 8PY, UK']]

This is particularly useful for trans-disciplinary research fields such as biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF), where complex syntheses integrate data over large temporal, spatial and taxonomic scales. However, depending on the data used and the complexity of the analysis, scientific workflows can grow very complex which makes them hard to understand and reuse. Here we argue that enabling simplicity starting from the beginning of the data life cycle adhering to good practices of data management can significantly reduce the overall complexity of scientific workflows. It can simplify the processes of data inclusion, cleaning, merging and imputation. To illustrate our points we chose a typical analysis in BEF research, the aggregation of carbon pools in a forest ecosystem. We propose indicators to measure the complexity of workflow components including the data sources. We illustrate that the complexity decreases exponentially during the course of the analysis and that simple text-based measures can help to identify bottlenecks in a workflow.

Publishers may present data as supplemental material to a journal article, with a descriptive \u201cdata paper,\u201d or independently. Complicating the situation, different initiatives and communities use the same terms to refer to distinct but overlapping concepts. For instance, the term published means that the data is publicly available and citable to virtually everyone, but it may or may not imply that the data has been peer-reviewed. In turn, what is meant by data peer review is far from defined; standards and processes encompass the full range employed in reviewing the literature, plus some novel variations. Basic data citation is a point of consensus, but the general agreement on the core elements of a dataset citation frays if the data is dynamic or part of a larger set.

Nonetheless, despite being one of the most developed countries in Latin America, Chile imports most of the knowledge and technology necessary to drive innovation in the country. The tight budget that the Chilean government assigned to research and development and the absence of a long-term scientific agenda contributed to a limited supply of scientists over the years. In an effort to reverse this scenario, Chile has created several fellowships, such as the Becas Chile Program (BCP) to encourage new generations to pursue graduate studies to ultimately advance research and development in situ. More than 6000 fellows are now being trained abroad, accumulating an incredible potential to transform the Chilean scientific environment as we know it.\xa0 Chile now faces a greater challenge: it has to offer infrastructure and job openings to the highly skilled professionals in whom it invested. Unfortunately no clear public policies to address this situation have been developed, partially due to the lack of a dedicated institution, such as a Ministry for Science and Technology which could focalize the necessary efforts to promote such policies. Therefore, in the meantime, Chilean scientist have been motivated to create different organizations, such as, Mas Ciencia para Chile and Nexos Chile-USA, to promote constructive discussion of the policies that could be implemented to improve the Chilean scientific situation.

We present a chief resident-led, small-group, problem-based curriculum for teaching first-year internal medicine residents, and provide preliminary data supporting the efficacy of this approach.Methods: The seminar consisted of 11 4-week modules. Week 1 was a team-based crossword competition. Weeks 2-4 were small-group, problem-based clinical reasoning sessions taught by chief residents. The program was evaluated via pre- and post-module multiple-choice tests. Resident satisfaction data were collected via self-reported, anonymous surveys.Results: Preliminary results revealed a statistically significant increase from pre-test to post-test score for 9 of the 11 modules. The chest pain, fever, abdominal pain, shock, syncope, jaundice, dizziness, anemia, and acute kidney injury modules achieved statistical significance. Additionally, resident satisfaction surveys show that this teaching approach was an enjoyable experience for our residents.Discussion: Our chief seminar is an evidence-based, clinical reasoning approach for graduate medical education that uses active learning techniques.

This software only allows data collection on the phone using a single questionnaire form that is tailored to the needs of the user (including a single GPS point and photo per entry), whereas many applications require a more complex structure, allowing users to link a series of forms in a linear or branching hierarchy, along with the addition of any number of media types accessible from smartphones and/or tablet devices (e.g., GPS, photos, videos, sound clips and barcode scanning). A much enhanced version of EpiCollect has been developed (EpiCollect+). The individual data collection forms in EpiCollect+ provide more design complexity than the single form used in EpiCollect, and the software allows the generation of complex data collection projects through the ability to link many forms together in a linear (or branching) hierarchy. Furthermore, EpiCollect+ allows the collection of multiple media types as well as standard text fields, increased data validation and form logic. The entire process of setting up a complex mobile phone data collection project to the specification of a user (project and form definitions) can be undertaken at the EpiCollect+ website using a simple \u2018drag and drop\u2019 procedure, with visualisation of the data gathered using Google Maps and charts at the project website.

[u'Observational articles: a tool to reconstruct ecological history based on chronicling unusual events', ['Ferdinando Boero'], u'09 Aug 2013', u'Natural history is based on observations, whereas modern ecology is mostly based on experiments aimed at testing hypotheses, either in the field or in a computer. Furthermore, experiments often reveal generalities that are taken as norms. Ecology, however, is a historical discipline and history is driven by both regularities (deriving from norms) and irregularities, or contingencies, which occur when norms are broken. If only norms occured, there would be no history. The current disregard for the importance of contingencies and anecdotes is preventing us from understanding ecological history. We need rules and norms, but we also need records about apparently irrelevant things that, in non-linear systems like ecological ones, might become the drivers of change and, thus, the determinants of history. The same arguments also hold in the field of evolutionary biology, with natural selection being the ecological driver of evolutionary change. It is important that scientists are able to publish potentially important observations, particularly those that are unrelated to their current projects that have no sufficient grounds to be framed into a classical eco-evolutionary paper, and could feasibly impact on the history of the systems in which they occurred. A report on any deviation from the norm would be welcome, from the disappearance of species to their sudden appearance in great quantities.

If, on the other hand, submission were based on perceived probability of acceptance, negative and positive studies would not differ in terms of acceptance rates, but in terms of quality.It is shown, using a simple graphical model, how similar underlying situations as regards the relationship between quality and probability of acceptance on the one hand and study outcome (positive or negative) and probability of acceptance on the other could produce dramatically different results depending on the behaviour of authors.Furthermore, there is, in fact, some evidence that submitted negative studies are, on average, of higher quality than positive ones.

The brain endothelial cells of the blood brain barrier (BBB) serve as the interface between the systemic circulation and the brain microenvironment and are therefore likely to be a key player in the development of neuropathology associated with systemic inflammation. Endothelial cells are known to require soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) in order to respond to IL-6, but studies in rat models have shown that this is not the case for brain endothelial cells and studies conducted in human cells are limited. Here we report for the first time that the human cerebral microvascular cell line, hCMVEC, uses the classical mIL-6R signalling pathway in response to IL-6 in a concentration-dependent manner as measured by the production of monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP-1). This novel finding highlights a unique characteristic of human brain endothelial cells and that further investigation into the phenotype of this cell type is needed to elucidate the mechanisms of BBB pathology in inflammatory conditions.', u'/articles/5-270/v1', ['Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases', 'Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry'], [u'Department of Anatomy and Medical Imaging and the Centre for Brain Research, Faculty of Medical and  Health Sciences (FMHS), University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand']]
[u'Mast cell activation is enhanced by Tim1:Tim4 interaction but not by Tim-1 antibodies', ['Binh Phong', 'Lawrence P. Kane'], u'01 Mar 2016', u'Polymorphisms in the T cell (or transmembrane) immunoglobulin and mucin domain 1 (TIM-1) gene, particularly in the mucin domain, have been associated with atopy and allergic diseases in mice and human. Genetic- and antibody-mediated studies revealed that Tim-1 functions as a positive regulator of Th2 responses, while certain antibodies to Tim-1 can exacerbate or reduce allergic lung inflammation. Tim-1 can also positively regulate the function of B cells, NKT cells, dendritic cells and mast cells. However, the precise molecular mechanisms by which Tim-1 modulates immune cell function are currently unknown. In this study, we have focused on defining Tim-1-mediated signaling pathways that enhance mast cell activation through the high affinity IgE receptor (FceRI). Using a Tim-1 mouse model lacking the mucin domain (Tim-1Dmucin), we show for the first time that the polymorphic Tim-1 mucin region is dispensable for normal mast cell activation. We further show that Tim-4 cross-linking of Tim-1 enhances select signaling pathways downstream of FceRI in mast cells, including mTOR-dependent signaling, leading to increased cytokine production but without affecting degranulation.', u'/articles/5-251/v1', ['Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases'], [u'Department of Immunology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, USA', u'Immunology Graduate Program, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, USA']]
[u'Validation of a commercially available anti-REDD1 antibody using RNA interference and REDD1-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts', ['Deborah L. Grainger', 'Lydia Kutzler', 'Sharon L. Rannels', 'Scot R. Kimball'], u'01 Mar 2016', u'REDD1 is a transcriptional target gene of p53 and HIF-1, and an inhibitor of mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) complex 1 (mTORC1)-signaling through PP2A-dependent interaction, making it an important convergence point of both tumor suppression and cell growth pathways. In accordance with this positioning, REDD1 levels are transcriptionally upregulated in response to a variety of cellular stress factors such as nutrient deprivation, hypoxia and DNA damage. In the absence of such conditions, and in particular where growth factor signaling is activated, REDD1 expression is typically negligible; therefore, it is necessary to induce REDD1 prior to experimentation or detection in model systems. Here, we evaluated the performance of a commercially available polyclonal antibody recognizing REDD1 by Western blotting in the presence of thapsigargin, a pharmacological inducer of ER stress well known to upregulate REDD1 protein expression. Further, REDD1 antibody specificity was challenged in HEK-293 cells in the presence of RNA interference and with a REDD1-/- mouse embryonic fibroblast knockout cell line. Results showed reproducibility and specificity of the antibody, which was upheld in the presence of thapsigargin treatment. We conclude that this antibody can be used to reliably detect REDD1 endogenous expression in samples of both human and mouse origin.', u'/articles/5-250/v1', ['Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases'], [u'Proteintech Group, Manchester, UK', u'Department of Cellular and Molecular Physiology, Penn State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, USA']]

Treating physicians completed a one-page questionnaire on lupus medications, disease activity, and outcomes. Clinical response was defined using SLEDAI 2K and improvement in the clinical manifestation(s) being treated.Results: The most common clinical SLE manifestations/indications requiring therapy with Acthar Gel were arthritis, rash, and inability to taper corticosteroids. The mean SLEDAI 2K score at baseline was 5.8 \xb1 5.0 (range 0-16). Six patients were concomitantly treated with corticosteroids (mean dose 18.3mg/day).

[u'A new hypothesis: some metastases are the result of inflammatory processes by adapted cells, especially adapted immune cells at sites of inflammation', ['Leili Shahriyari'], u'16 Feb 2016', u'There is an old hypothesis that metastasis is the result of migration of tumor cells from the tumor to a distant site. In this article, we propose another mechanism for metastasis, for cancers that are initiated at the site of chronic inflammation.\xa0We suggest that cells at the site of chronic inflammation might become adapted to\xa0the inflammatory process, and these adaptations may lead to the initiation of an inflammatory tumor. For example, in an inflammatory tumor immune cells might be adapted to send signals of\xa0proliferation or angiogenesis, and epithelial cells might be adapted to proliferation (like inactivation\xa0of tumor suppressor genes).\xa0Therefore, we hypothesize that metastasis could be the result of an inflammatory process by adapted cells, especially adapted immune cells at the site of inflammation, as well as the migration of tumor cells with the help of activated platelets, which travel between sites of inflammation. \xa0If this hypothesis is correct, then any treatment causing necrotic cell death may not be a good solution. Because necrotic cells in the tumor micro-environment or anywhere in the body activate the immune system to initiate the inflammatory process, and the involvement of adapted immune cells in the inflammatory processes leads to the formation and progression of tumors. Adapted activated immune cells send more signals of proliferation and/or angiogenesis than normal\xa0cells. Moreover, if there were adapted epithelial cells, they would divide at a much higher\xa0rate in response to the proliferation signals than normal cells. Thus, not only would the tumor come back\xa0after the treatment, but it would also grow more aggressively.', u'/articles/5-175/v1', ['Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases', 'Eye Disorders & ENT', 'Oncology & Hematology', 'Urology, Gynecology & Obstetrics'], [u'Mathematical Biosciences Institute, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA']]
[u'The business of deubiquitination \u2013 location, location, location', ['Erin S. Coyne', 'Simon S.

This ubiquitination is controlled by both ubiquitinating and deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs). The number of ubiquitin ligases exceeds that of DUBs by about eightfold, indicating that DUBs may have much broader substrate specificity. Despite this, DUBs have been shown to have quite specific physiological functions. This functional specificity is likely due to very precise regulation of activity arising from the sophisticated use of all mechanisms of enzyme regulation. In this commentary, we briefly review key features of DUBs with more emphasis on regulation. In particular, we focus on localization of the enzymes as a critical regulatory mechanism which when integrated with control of expression, substrate activation, allosteric regulation, and post-translational modifications results in precise spatial and temporal deubiquitination of proteins and therefore specific physiological functions. Identification of compounds that target the structural elements in DUBs that dictate localization may be a more promising approach to development of drugs with specificity of action than targeting the enzymatic activity, which for most DUBs is dependent on a thiol group that can react non-specifically with many compounds in large-scale screening.', u'/articles/5-163/v1', ['Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases', 'Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry', 'Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'Polypeptide Laboratory, Departments of Medicine and Biochemistry, McGill University, McGill University Health Centre Research Institute, Montreal, QC, Canada']]

The pathogenesis of severe disease is thought to be in part immune mediated, but the exact mechanisms remain to be defined. The current treatment of dengue relies on supportive measures with no licensed therapeutics available to date. There have been recent advances in our understanding of a number of areas of dengue research, of which the following will be discussed in this review: the drivers behind the global dengue pandemic, viral structure and epitope binding, risk factors for severe disease and its pathogenesis, as well as the findings of recent clinical trials including therapeutics and vaccines.

[u'Referencing cross-reactivity of detection antibodies for protein array experiments', ['Darragh Lemass', "Richard O'Kennedy", 'Gregor S.

High-throughput protein array characterisation of complex antibody repertoires requires a platform-dependent, lot-to-lot validation of secondary detection antibodies. This article details the validation of an affinity-isolated anti-chicken IgY antibody produced in rabbit and a goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase using protein arrays consisting of 7,390 distinct human proteins. Probing protein arrays with secondary antibodies in absence of chicken serum revealed non-specific binding to 61 distinct human proteins. The cross-reactivity of the tested secondary detection antibodies points towards the necessity of platform-specific antibody characterisation studies for all secondary immunoreagents. Secondary antibody characterisation using protein arrays enables generation of reference lists of cross-reactive proteins, which can be then excluded from analysis in follow-up experiments. Furthermore, making such cross-reactivity lists accessible to the wider research community may help to interpret data generated by the same antibodies in applications not related to protein arrays such as immunoprecipitation, Western blots or other immunoassays.', u'/articles/5-73/v1', ['Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases'], [u'Biomedical Diagnostics Institute, National Centre for Sensor Research, Dublin City University, Dublin, Ireland', u'School of Biotechnology, Dublin City University, Dublin, Ireland']]

These have identified a range of FDA-approved active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) with anti-EBOV activity in vitro and several of which are also active in a mouse infection model. There are millions of additional commercially-available molecules that could be screened for potential activities as anti-EBOV compounds. One way to prioritize compounds for testing is to generate computational models based on the high throughput screening data and then virtually screen compound libraries. In the current study, we have generated Bayesian machine learning models with viral pseudotype entry assay and the EBOV replication assay data. We have validated the models internally and externally. We have also used these models to computationally score the MicroSource library of drugs to select those likely to be potential inhibitors. Three of the highest scoring molecules that were not in the model training sets, quinacrine, pyronaridine and tilorone, were tested in vitro and had EC50 values of 350, 420 and 230 nM, respectively. Pyronaridine is a component of a combination therapy for malaria that was recently approved by the European Medicines Agency, which may make it more readily accessible for clinical testing.

Endotoxin, a component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, is a potent inflammatory stimulus in humans. Bactericidal/permeability increasing protein (BPI), a constituent of human neutrophil granules, binds endotoxin thereby precluding endotoxin-induced inflammation and also has direct anti-infective properties against bacteria. As a consequence of myeloablative therapy used in preparation for hematopoietic cell infusion, patients experience gastrointestinal leak of bacteria and bacterial toxins into the systemic circulation and a period of inflammatory cytokine elevation associated with subsequent regimen-related toxicities.\xa0 Patients frequently become endotoxemic and febrile as well as BPI-deficient due to sustained neutropenia. To examine whether enhancing endotoxin-neutralizing and anti-infective activity by exogenous administration of a recombinant N-terminal fragment of BPI (rBPI21, generic name opebacan) might ameliorate regimen-related toxicities including infection, we recruited patients scheduled to undergo myeloablative HCT to participate in a proof-of-concept prospective phase I/II trial. After the HCT preparative regimen was completed, opebacan was initiated 18-36 hours prior to administration of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells (defined as Day 0) and continued for 72 hours. The trial was to have included escalation of rBPI21 dose and duration but was stopped prematurely due to lack of further drug availability.\xa0 Therefore, to better understand the clinical course of opebacan-treated patients (n=6), we compared their outcomes with a comparable cohort meeting the same eligibility criteria and enrolled in a non-interventional myeloablative HCT observational study (n = 35).\xa0 Opebacan-treated participants had earlier platelet engraftment (p=0.005), mirroring beneficial effects of rBPI21 previously observed in irradiated mice, fewer documented infections (p=0.03) and appeared less likely to experience significant regimen-related toxicities (p=0.05).

Also, inverse polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were performed to detect the free circular forms of gcu14, blaGES-1 and aacA4. The Northern blot and real time RT-PCR revealed a polycistronic transcription, in which the fused cassette blaGES-1/aacA4 is transcribed as a unique gene, while gcu14 (with a canonical attC recombination site) has a monocistronic transcription. The gcu14 cassette, closer to the weak configuration of cassette promoter (PcW), had a higher transcription level than blaGES-1/aacA4, indicating that the cassette position affects the transcript amounts. The presence of ORF-11 at attI1, immediately preceding gcu14, and of a Shine-Dalgarno sequence upstream blaGES-1/aacA4 composes a scenario for the occurrence of array translation. Inverse PCR generated amplicons corresponding to gcu14, gcu14-aacA4 and gcu14-blaGES-1/aacA4 free circular forms, but not to blaGES-1 and aacA4 alone, indicating that the GES-1 truncated attC is not substrate of integrase activity and that these genes are mobilized together as a unique cassette.

Caged bees infected with Crithidia bombi\xa0had a slight preference for sucrose solution laced with the alkaloid and behavioural tests showed that the parasite infection induced an increased consumption of nicotine during foraging activity, though nicotine had an appetite-reducing effect overall. When ingested, nicotine delayed the progression of a gut infection in bumblebees by a few days, but dietary nicotine did not clear the infection, and after 10 days the parasite load approached that of control bees. Moreover, when pathogens were exposed to the alkaloid prior to host ingestion, the protozoan\u2019s viability was not directly affected, suggesting that anti-parasite effects were relatively weak. Nicotine consumption in a single dose did not impose any cost even in starved bees but the alkaloid had detrimental effects on healthy bees if consistently consumed for weeks. These toxic effects disappeared in infected bees, suggesting that detoxification costs might have been counterbalanced by the advantages in slowing the progression of the infection. Nicotine consumption did not affect bee lifespan but the reduction in the parasite load may have other likely unexplored subtle benefits both for individual bees and their colony. \xa0Potential evidence for self-medication is discussed.

Conventional radiological examinations in SLE patients include volumetric/ anatomical computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound (US). The utility of these modalities is limited, however, due to the complexity of the disease. Furthermore, standard CT and MRI contrast agents are contraindicated in patients with renal impairment. Various radiologic methods are currently being developed to improve disease characterization in patients with SLE beyond simple anatomical endpoints. Physiological non-contrast MRI protocols have been developed to assess tissue oxygenation, glomerular filtration, renal perfusion, interstitial diffusion, and inflammation-driven fibrosis in lupus nephritis (LN) patients. For neurological symptoms, vessel size imaging (VSI, an MRI approach utilizing T2-relaxing iron oxide nanoparticles) has shown promise as a diagnostic tool.

This dormancy (and resuscitation therefrom) often reflects the extent of the availability of free iron.

Identifying behavioral indicators of pain and sickness in calves with IBK is necessary for designing studies that aim to identify effective means of pain mitigation. Consistent with principles of the 3Rs for animal use in research, data from a randomized blinded challenge study was used to identify and describe variation of behaviors that could serve as reliable indicators of pain and sickness in calves with corneal injuries. Behavioral observations were collected from 29 Holstein calves 8 to 12 weeks of age randomly allocated to one of three treatments: (1) corneal scarification only, (2) corneal scarification with inoculation with Moraxella bovoculi and (3) corneal scarification with inoculation with Moraxella bovis. Behavior was continuously observed between time 1230 - 1730 h on day -1 (baseline time period) and day 0 (scarification time period). Corneal scarification and inoculation occurred between 0800 - 1000 h on day 0. Frequency of head-directed behaviors (head shaking, head rubbing, head scratching) and durations of head rubbing, feeding, standing with head lifted, lying with head lifted and sleeping were compared between study days and groups. Following scarification, the frequency of head-directed behavior significantly increased (p = 0.0001), as did duration of head rubbing (p=0.02). There was no significant effect of trial, trial day, treatment or treatment-day interaction on other behaviors studied.

Because of the important role of Hax1 in neutrophils we demonstrate here validation of two commercially available research antibodies directed against human Hax1 in the human myeloid leukemia cell line PLB-985 cells. We show that both the mouse anti-Hax1 monoclonal IgG directed against amino acids 10-148 of Hax1 and a rabbit anti-Hax1 polyclonal IgG antibody directed against full-length Hax1 reliably and consistently detect Hax1 during immunoblotting of three different PLB-985 cell densities.

However, the antigen specificity of these activated T-cells is relatively unknown. Previous studies using T-cell receptor polymerase chain reaction technology (TCR-PCR) have suggested there are expanded T-cell receptor (TCR) clones in psoriatic skin, suggesting a response to an unknown psoriatic antigen. Here we describe the results of high-throughput deep sequencing of the entire \u03b1\u03b2- and \u03b3\u03b4- TCR repertoire in normal healthy skin and psoriatic lesional and non-lesional skin. From this study, we were able to determine that there is a significant increase in the abundance of unique \u03b2- and \u03b3- TCR sequences in psoriatic lesional skin compared to non-lesional and normal skin, and that the entire T-cell repertoire in psoriasis is polyclonal, with similar diversity to normal and non-lesional skin. Comparison of the \u03b1\u03b2- and \u03b3\u03b4- TCR repertoire in paired non-lesional and lesional samples showed many common clones within a patient, and these close were often equally abundant in non-lesional and lesional skin, again suggesting a diverse T-cell repertoire. Although there were similar (and low) amounts of shared \u03b2-chain sequences between different patient samples, there was significantly increased sequence sharing of the \u03b3-chain in psoriatic skin from different individuals compared to those without psoriasis. This suggests that although the T-cell response in psoriasis is highly polyclonal, particular \u03b3\u03b4- T-cell subsets may be associated with this disease. Overall, our findings present the feasibility of this technology to determine the entire \u03b1\u03b2- and \u03b3\u03b4- T-cell repertoire in skin, and that psoriasis contains polyclonal and diverse \u03b1\u03b2- and \u03b3\u03b4- T-cell populations.', u'/articles/4-460/v1', ['Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases', 'Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology', 'Dermatology'], [u'Laboratory for Investigative Dermatology, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY, USA', u'Adaptive Biotechnologies, Seattle, WA, USA', u'Division of Dermatology, Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA']]

In order to investigate the differences between these proteins, we performed experimental kinetic measurements, \u2022NO decomposition, as well as molecular dynamics simulations of the wild type Mt-trHbN and two mutants, VG8F and VG8W. These mutations affect both the tunnels accessibility as well as the affinity of distal site water molecules, thus modifying the ligand access to the iron.

The treatment prolonged survival (10% of the treated 20 NZB/W mice died compared to 50% of the 30 NZB/W mice, with no mortality in the control NZW mice). Real-time PCR analysis showed a three- to fifteen-fold increase in the expression of GFAP, vimentin and syndecan4 in the cerebral cortex of 44 week NZB/W mice. These alterations were prevented by CY and PD treatment. Immunostaining revealed increased GFAP expression in NZB/W mice compared to congenic, nondiseased NZW mice, which was prevented by treatment. In addition, concomitant changes were observed in the expression of extracellular matrix proteins, collagen IV and fibronectin. To determine the impact of these alterations on the neurological manifestations of SLE, behavior was studied in these mice. The NZB/W mice were spontaneously less active in the open field and exhibited a decrease in distance traveled (58% of control, p<0.01) and ambulatory measurements (52% of control, p<0.01).

[u'The complement system in lupus nephritis', ['Lihua Bao', 'Patrick N. Cunningham', 'Richard J. Quigg'], u'08 Jun 2015', u'The complement is part of the innate immune system and can be activated through one of three pathways. To prevent injury of self-tissue, complement is tightly regulated by over 30 proteins. Complement plays dual roles in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). On one hand, hereditary homozygous deficiencies of classical pathway components, such as C1q and C4, are associated with an increased risk for SLE, suggesting that complement is protective. On the other hand, complement is systemically consumed in both experimental and human SLE, suggesting its pathogenic role.\xa0 Studies in genetically altered mice have shown that lack of complement inhibitors, such as complement factor H (CFH) or decay-accelerating factor (DAF) accelerates the development of experimental lupus nephritis; while treatment with recombinant protein inhibitors such as CR1-related protein y (Crry)-Ig, CR2-Crry, CR2-DAF and CR2-CFH ameliorates the disease development.\xa0 Complement-targeted drugs, including soluble complement receptor 1 (TP10), C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH), and a monoclonal anti-C5 antibody (Eculizumab) have been shown to inhibit complement safely, and are now being investigated in a variety of clinical conditions.

These cells show a high level of physiological, morphological and neurochemical heterogeneity, and play highly specific roles in neuronal circuits. In the mammalian hippocampus, these are divided into 21 different subtypes of GABAergic interneurons based on their expression of different markers, morphology and their electrophysiological properties. Ideally, all can be marked using an antibody directed against the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, but parvalbumin, calbindin, somatostatin, and calretinin are also commonly used as markers to narrow down the specific interneuron subtype. Here, we describe a journey to find the necessary immunological reagents for studying GABAergic interneurons of the mouse hippocampus. Based on web searches there are several hundreds of different antibodies on the market directed against these four markers. Searches in the literature databases allowed us to narrow it down to a subset of antibodies most commonly used in publications. However, in our hands the most cited ones did not work for immunofluorescence stainings of formaldehyde fixed tissue sections and cultured hippocampal neurons, and we had to immunostain our way through thirteen different commercial antibodies before finally finding a suitable antibody for each of the four markers. The antibodies were evaluated based on signal-to-noise ratios as well as if positive cells were found in layers of the hippocampus where they have previously been described. Additionally, the antibodies were also tested on sections from mouse spinal cord with similar criteria for specificity of the antibodies. Using the antibodies with a high rating on pAbmAbs, an antibody review database, stainings with high signal-to-noise ratios and location of the immunostained cells in accordance with the literature could be obtained, making these antibodies suitable choices for studying the GABAergic system.', u'/articles/3-242/v3', ['Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases'], [u'The Lundbeck Foundation Research Center MIND, Department of Biomedicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, 8000 C, Denmark', u'Stereology and Electron Microscopy Laboratory, Department of Clinical institute, Aarhus University, Aarhus, 8000 C, Denmark', u'Department of Neuroscience, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, FL 32224, USA', u'Danish Research Institute of Translational Neuroscience DANDRITE, Aarhus, 8000, Denmark']]

[u'Understanding carbon regulation in aquatic systems - Bacteriophages as a model', ['Swapnil Sanmukh', 'Krishna Khairnar', 'Waman Paunikar', 'Satish Lokhande'], u'01 Jun 2015', u'The bacteria and their phages are the most abundant constituents of the aquatic environment, and so represent an ideal model for studying carbon regulation in an aquatic system. The microbe-mediated interconversion of bioavailable organic carbon (OC) into dissolved organic carbon (DOC) by the microbial carbon pump (MCP) has been suggested to have the potential to revolutionize our view of carbon sequestration. It is estimated that DOC is the largest pool of organic matter in the ocean and, though a major component of the global carbon cycle, its source is not yet well understood. A key element of the carbon cycle is the microbial conversion of DOC into inedible forms. The primary aim of this study is to understand the phage conversion from organic to inorganic carbon during phage-host interactions.Time studies of phage-host interactions under controlled conditions reveal their impact on the total carbon content of the samples and their interconversion of organic and inorganic carbon compared to control samples. A total organic carbon (TOC) analysis showed an increase in inorganic carbon content by 15-25 percent in samples with bacteria and phage compared to samples with bacteria alone. Compared to control samples, the increase in inorganic carbon content was 60-70-fold in samples with bacteria and phage, and 50-55-fold for samples with bacteria alone.

[u'Sepsis breakthroughs in 2014', ['James A. Russell', 'Keith R. Walley'], u'28 May 2015', u'The mortality of sepsis may be decreasing and, because there are more survivors, it is increasingly important to understand the epidemiology, pathogenesis, genetics, prevention, and treatment of the impaired long-term outcomes of sepsis. Recent insights on the clearance of bacterial products during sepsis suggest new strategies for early intervention. Immune suppression/immune reprogramming to decrease later secondary infections is a novel strategy now in clinical trials. The Protocolized Care for the Early Septic Shock (ProCESS), Australasian Resuscitation in Sepsis Evaluation (ARISE) and ProMISe randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) versus usual care found no differences between groups in mortality. Fluid therapies may not require full-on EGDT, but rather emphasize the importance of early recognition and resuscitation of sepsis. The Albumin Italian Outcome Sepsis (ALBIOS) RCT did not find a difference between albumin (titrated to serum albumin >30 g/L) and crystalloid in severe sepsis. However, in a subgroup analysis, mortality was lower in the albumin group in patients who had septic shock. Therapeutic use of albumin may be beneficial in septic shock, but requires further evaluation in RCTs. A recent RCT of conservative versus liberal transfusion strategies (70 versus 90 g/L, respectively) found no difference in mortality in septic shock. The transfusion threshold in septic shock is now 70\u201390 g/L. Although there was no difference in mortality between a usual or a high target mean arterial pressure (MAP) for septic shock resuscitation, a higher MAP target may be beneficial in patients who have pre-existing hypertension, because higher MAP may decrease the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) and need for renal replacement therapy (RRT). Nutrition practice can continue with enteral nutrition started on days 2\u20133 (i.e., early but there is no indication for very early parenteral nutrition). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the commonest complication of sepsis. Two recent RCTs of simvastatin and rosuvastatin in ARDS were not positive. Early statins at appropriate doses and plasma levels deserve a trial in sepsis. In future, perhaps three changes could improve the chances of having positive trials in sepsis: the use of biomarkers to stratify patients; adaptive trial design to enhance dose selection and reject compounds that are unlikely to be suitable at Phase 2; and the use of composite organ dysfunction as the primary outcome.', u'/articles/4-131/v1', ['Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases', 'Oncology & Hematology', 'Critical Care & Emergency Medicine', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'Centre for Heart Lung Innovation, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, V6Z 1Y6, Canada', u'Division of Critical Care Medicine, St. Paul\u2019s Hospital, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, V6Z 1Y6, Canada']]

[u'The endothelial deprotection hypothesis for lupus pathogenesis: the dual role of C1q as a mediator of clearance and regulator of endothelial permeability', ['Jozsef Prechl', 'Laszlo Czirjak'], u'11 May 2015', u'Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a heterogeneous multifactorial systemic autoimmune disease affecting several organs. SLE can start relatively early in life and results in impaired quality of life and shortened life expectancy because of a gradual disease progression leading to cardiovascular, renal and neoplastic disease. The basic mechanisms of the pathogenesis of the disease still remain to be clarified. It is clear that complement proteins play a key and complex role in the development of SLE. Complement component C1q has been known to be a fundamental component of lupus development, but most explanations focus on its role in apoptotic debris removal. Importantly, C1q was recently found to play a key role in the maintenance of vascular endothelial integrity.We suggest that apoptotic products, endothelial cells and extracellular matrix components, which display negatively charged moieties, compete for binding to molecules of the innate humoral immune response, like C1q. Genetic or acquired factors leading to an increased load of apoptotic cell debris and decrease or absence of C1q therefore interfere with the regulation of endothelial permeability and integrity. Furthermore, we suggest that lupus is the net result of an imbalance between the two functions of immune clearance and vascular endothelial integrity maintenance, an imbalance triggered and sustained by autoimmunity, which skews C1q consumption by IgG-mediated complement classical pathway activation on autoantigens. In this triangle of innate clearance, autoimmunity and endothelial integrity, C1q plays a central role.Hence, we interpret the pathogenesis of lupus by identifying three key components, namely innate immune clearance, autoimmunity and endothelial integrity and we establish a link between these components based on the protective role that innate clearance molecules play in endothelial renewal. By including the vasoprotective role of C1q in the interpretation of SLE development we attempt to provide novel explanations for the symptoms, organ damage, diagnostic and therapeutic difficulties of the disease.', u'/articles/4-24/v2', ['Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases'], [u'Diagnosticum Zrt, Budapest, 1047, Hungary', u'MTA-ELTE Immunology Research Group, Budapest, 1117, Hungary', u'Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, Clinic Center, University of P\xe9cs, P\xe9cs, 7632, Hungary']]

Preliminary clinical, epidemiological and immunological studies suggest that infection with the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) could be transferred from person to person via intimate human contact without a tick vector. Failure to detect viable Borrelia spirochetes in vaginal and seminal secretions would argue against this hypothesis.Methods: Patients with and without a history of Lyme disease were selected for the study after informed consent was obtained. Serological testing for Bb was performed on all subjects. Semen or vaginal secretions were inoculated into BSK-H medium and cultured for four weeks. Examination of genital cultures and culture concentrates for the presence of spirochetes was performed using light and darkfield microscopy, and spirochete concentrates were subjected to Dieterle silver staining, anti-Bb immunohistochemical staining, molecular hybridization and PCR analysis for further characterization. Immunohistochemical and molecular testing was performed in three independent laboratories in a blinded fashion. Positive and negative controls were included in all experiments.Results: Control subjects who were asymptomatic and seronegative for Bb had no detectable spirochetes in genital secretions by PCR analysis. In contrast, spirochetes were observed in cultures of genital secretions from 11 of 13 subjects diagnosed with Lyme disease, and motile spirochetes were detected in genital culture concentrates from 12 of 13 Lyme disease patients using light and darkfield microscopy. Morphological features of spirochetes were confirmed by Dieterle silver staining and immunohistochemical staining of culture concentrates. Molecular hybridization and PCR testing confirmed that the spirochetes isolated from semen and vaginal secretions were strains of Borrelia, and all cultures were negative for treponemal spirochetes. PCR sequencing of cultured spirochetes from three couples having unprotected sex indicated that two couples had identical strains of Bb sensu stricto in their semen and vaginal secretions, while the third couple had identical strains of B. hermsii detected in their genital secretions.Conclusions: The culture of viable Borrelia spirochetes in genital secretions suggests that Lyme disease could be transmitted by intimate contact from person to person.

The genome of Ebola, a member of the Filoviridae family, encodes seven proteins. Based on the recently implemented software (PAGAL) for analyzing the hydrophobicity and amphipathicity properties of alpha helices (AH) in proteins, we characterize the helices in the Ebola proteome. We demonstrate that AHs with characteristically unique features are involved in critical interactions with the host proteins. For example, the Ebola virus membrane fusion subunit, GP2, from the envelope glycoprotein ectodomain has an AH with a large hydrophobic moment. The neutralizing antibody (KZ52) derived from a human survivor of the 1995 Kikwit outbreak recognizes a protein epitope on this AH, emphasizing the critical nature of this secondary structure in the virulence of the Ebola virus. Our method ensures a comprehensive list of such `hotspots'. These helices probably are or can be the target of molecules designed to inhibit AH mediated protein-protein interactions. Further, by comparing the AHs in proteins of the related Marburg viruses, we are able to elicit subtle changes in the proteins that might render them ineffective to previously successful drugs. Such differences are difficult to identify by a simple sequence or structural alignment.

While many promising biotherapeutics are being tested, the search for a small molecule has yet to deliver an approved drug or therapeutic for the Ebola or similar filoviruses that cause haemorrhagic fever. Two recent high throughput screens published in 2013 did however identify several hits that progressed to animal studies that are FDA approved drugs used for other indications. The current computational analysis uses these molecules from two different structural classes to construct a common features pharmacophore. This ligand-based pharmacophore implicates a possible common target or mechanism that could be further explored. A recent structure based design project yielded nine co-crystal structures of pyrrolidinone inhibitors bound to the viral protein 35 (VP35). When receptor-ligand pharmacophores based on the analogs of these molecules and the protein structures were constructed, the molecular features partially overlapped with the common features of solely ligand-based pharmacophore models based on FDA approved drugs. These previously identified FDA approved drugs with activity against Ebola were therefore docked into this protein. The antimalarials chloroquine and amodiaquine docked favorably in VP35.

The protein VP24 is pivotal in achieving this in Ebola, although interestingly the mechanism of immune suppression is different in the closely related Marburg virus. Here, we illustrate that a possible molecular basis for this difference emanates from two alpha helical structures (\u03b15 and \u03b16) in VP24 involved in binding human karyopherin (KPNA) (PDBid:4U2X), wherein the Ebola and Marburg viruses have distinctly different charged properties in \u03b15. \u03b16 is absent in Marburg, and has a different hydrophobic moment in the Reston Ebola (REBOV) species, which is surprisingly non-pathogenic in humans. Based on the hypothesis that REBOV is not immunosuppressive, which is in turn is due to its inability to bind KPNA, we show by docking KPNA to the REBOV VP24 that the single amino acid substitution R140S is responsible for this difference between REBOV and Zaire Ebola strains. Such a scenario of getting a virulent REBOV through a single mutation is particularly worrisome, since the REBOV, once found only in monkeys, has been recently detected in pigs.

[u'An evolutionarily significant unicellular strategy in response to starvation in Dictyostelium social amoebae', ['Darja Dubravcic', 'Minus van Baalen', 'Clement Nizak'], u'05 Dec 2014', u'The social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum is widely studied for its multicellular development program as a response to starvation. Aggregates of up to 106 cells form fruiting bodies containing (i) dormant spores (~80%) that can persist for months in the absence of nutrients, and (ii) dead stalk cells (~20%) that promote the dispersion of the spores towards nutrient-rich areas.It is often overlooked that not all cells aggregate upon starvation. Using a new quantitative approach based on time-lapse fluorescence microscopy and a low ratio of reporting cells, we have quantified this fraction of non-aggregating cells. In realistic starvation conditions, up to 15% of cells do not aggregate, which makes this third cell fate a significant component of the population-level response of social amoebae to starvation. Non-aggregating cells have an advantage over cells in aggregates since they resume growth earlier upon arrival of new nutrients, but have a shorter lifespan under prolonged starvation. We find that phenotypic heterogeneities linked to cell nutritional state bias the representation of cells in the aggregating vs. non-aggregating fractions, and thus affect population partitioning. Next, we report that the fraction of non-aggregating cells depends on genetic factors that regulate the timing of starvation, signal sensing efficiency and aggregation efficiency. In addition, interactions between clones in mixtures of non-isogenic cells affect the partitioning of each clone into both fractions. We further build a numerical model to test the evolutionary significance of the non-aggregating cell fraction. The partitioning of cells into aggregating and non-aggregating fractions is optimal in fluctuating environments with an unpredictable duration of starvation periods.

To understand the signal transduction mechanism by GraSR, we investigated the kinase activity of the cytoplasmic domain of histidine kinase GraS and the interaction with its cognate response regulator GraR. We also investigated interactions among the auxiliary protein GraX, GraS/R and the ATPase protein of the ABC transporter, VraF. We found that GraS lacks autophosphorylation activity, unlike a similar histidine kinase, BceS, of Bacillus subtilis. In addition, the interaction between GraS and GraR is very weak in comparison to the stronger interaction observed between BceS and its conjugated response regulator, BceR, suggesting that CAMP signaling may not flow directly from GraS to GraR. We found that the auxiliary protein GraX interacts with VraF and GraR, and requires the histidine phosphotransfer and dimerization domain of GraS to interact with this protein. Further, VraF requires the GraS region that connects the membrane-bound domain with the cytoplasmic domain of this protein for interaction with GraS. The interactions of GraX with GraS/R and VraF indicate that GraX may serve as a scaffold to bring these proteins in close proximity to GraS, plausibly to facilitate activation of GraS to ultimately transduce the signal to GraR.', u'/articles/3-252/v2', ['Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases'], [u'Departments of Biology, York University, Toronto, Toronto, ON, M3J 1P3, Canada', u'Department of Chemistry, York University, Toronto, Toronto, ON, M3J 1P3, Canada']]

Therefore, we endeavored to determine the responses in three haloarchaea: Halorubrum lacusprofundi (Hla), Haloferax volcanii (Hvo), and Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 (NRC-1) to growth under acidic and alkaline pH. Our observations showed that the transcriptomes of Hvo and NRC-1 regulated stress, motility, and ABC transporters in a similar manner, which is in line with previous reports from other prokaryotes when grown in an acidic environment.\xa0 However, the pattern for Hla was more species specific. For alkaline stress, all three haloarchaea responded in a manner similar to well-studied archaea and bacteria showing the haloarchaeal response was general to prokaryotes. Additionally, we performed an analysis on the changes in the transcriptomes of the three haloarchaea when shifting from one pH extreme to the other. The results showed that the transcriptomes of all three haloarchaea respond more similarly when moving from alkaline to acidic conditions compared to a shift in the opposite direction. Interestingly, our studies also showed that individual genes of multiple paralogous gene families (tbp, tfb, orc/cdc6, etc.) found in the haloarchaea were regulated under specific stresses thereby providing evidence that they modulate the response to various environmental stresses.

Pheromonal communication is an open broadcast system that can be intercepted by unintended receivers such as predators and prey. We have recently reported that male rats infected by the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii become more attractive to female rats. This suggests a facilitatory effect of infection on rat pheromone production. In view of the open nature of pheromonal communication, we postulate that Toxoplasma gondii infection collateraly enhances kairomonal valence of infected rats to their prey. We compared the strength of kairomonal interception by mice when using scent marks from rats infected with Toxoplasma gondii vs. marks from uninfected control rats. Mice exhibited greater avoidance to both fresh urine and aged rat urine marks obtained from infected animals.

Tomlinson', 'Jinrong Qu', 'Anura Rambukkana'], u'14 Nov 2013', u'Background: Bacterial pathogens can manipulate or subvert host tissue cells to their advantage at different stages during infection, from initial colonization in primary host niches to dissemination. Recently, we have shown that Mycobacterium leprae (ML), the causative agent of human leprosy, reprogrammed its preferred host niche de-differentiated adult Schwann cells to progenitor/stem cell-like cells (pSLC) which appear to facilitate bacterial spread. Here, we studied how this cell fate change influences bacterial retention and transfer properties of Schwann cells before and after reprogramming.Results: Using primary fibroblasts as bacterial recipient cells, we showed that non-reprogrammed Schwann cells, which preserve all Schwann cell lineage and differentiation markers, possess high bacterial retention capacity when co-cultured with skin fibroblasts; Schwann cells failed to transfer bacteria to fibroblasts at higher numbers even after co-culture for 5 days. In contrast, pSLCs, which are derived from the same Schwann cells but have lost Schwann cell lineage markers due to reprogramming, efficiently transferred bacteria to fibroblasts within 24 hours.Conclusions: ML-induced reprogramming converts lineage-committed Schwann cells with high bacterial retention capacity to a cell type with pSLC stage with effective bacterial transfer properties. We propose that such changes in cellular properties may be associated with the initial intracellular colonization, which requires long-term bacterial retention within Schwann cells, in order to spread the infection to other tissues, which entails efficient bacterial transfer capacity to cells like fibroblasts which are abundant in many tissues, thereby potentially maximizing bacterial dissemination.

Protective nociceptive pain serves as an early warning system against noxious environmental stimuli. Tissue-resident mast cells orchestrate the increased thermal sensitivity following injection of basic secretagogue compound 48/80 in the hind paw tissues of ND4 mice. Here we investigated the effects of pre-treatment with TNF-\u03b1 neutralizing antibody on compound 48/80-provoked thermal hyperalgesia.Methods: We treated ND4 Swiss male mice with intravenous anti-TNF-\u03b1 antibody or vehicle 30 minutes prior to bilateral, intra-plantar compound 48/80 administration and measured changes in the timing of hind paw withdrawal observed subsequent to mice being placed on a 51oC hotplate. We also assessed changes in tissue swelling, TNF-\u03b1 gene expression and protein abundance, mast cell degranulation, and neutrophil influx in the hind paw tissue.Findings: We found that TNF-\u03b1 neutralization significantly blocked thermal hyperalgesia, and reduced early tissue swelling. TNF-\u03b1 neutralization had no significant effect on mast cell degranulation or neutrophil influx into the tissue, however. Moreover, no changes in TNF-\u03b1 protein or mRNA levels were detected within 3 hours of administration of compound 48/80.Interpretation:\xa0 The neutralizing antibodies likely target pre-formed TNF-\u03b1 including that stored in the granules of tissue-resident mast cells. Pre-formed TNF-\u03b1, released upon degranulation, has immediate effects on nociceptive signaling prior to the induction of neutrophil influx.

Kosher chicken had the highest frequency of antibiotic-resistant E. coli, nearly twice that of conventional products, a result that belies the historical roots of kosher as a means to ensure food safety.

To prevent a pathogenic immune reaction, the RhD-negative mother receives serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) containing polyclonal RhD-specific IgG Abs that is purified from healthy RhD-negative men immunized with RhD-positive RBCs. However, the protective mechanism of these polyclonal RhD-specific IgG Abs is unclear. It has become increasingly clear that the effector function of IgG Abs is regulated by the glycan pattern linked to the Fc region of IgG Abs. Non-fucosylated (afucosylated) IgG Abs have a higher affinity for activating Fc gamma receptors, and thus induce a stronger Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) reaction than do fucosylated IgG Abs. Agalactosylated and asialylated, autoantigen-specific serum IgG Abs correlate with pro-inflammatory immune responses and disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. In contrast, galactosylated and sialylated IgG Abs are immunosuppressive and inhibit in form of immune complexes (ICs) dendritic cell (DC) maturation and pro-inflammatory T and B cell immune responses in an antigen-specific manner. However, the galactosylation and sialylation levels of the protective polyclonal RhD-specific IgG Abs are unknown. Here, we purified RhD-specific IgG Abs from the approved commercial product Rhophylac\xae (CSL Behring) and found that these RhD-specific IgG Abs were even more galactosylated and sialylated than the total Rhophylac\xae IgG Abs. This result suggests that these galactosylated and sialylated polyclonal RhD-specific IgG Abs are immunosuppressive and induce tolerance against RhD, which would be in strong contrast to a low fucosylated, low galactosylated and low sialylated monoclonal RhD-specific IgG Ab developed to prevent fetal hemolytic disease\xa0that has recently passed a clinical phase II study.', u'/articles/2-169/v1', ['Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases', 'Urology, Gynecology & Obstetrics'], [u'Laboratory of Tolerance and Autoimmunity, German Rheumatism Research Center (DRFZ), Leibniz Institute, Berlin, 10117, Germany', u'Laboratory of Tolerance and Autoimmunity, Institute for Systemic Inflammation Research, University of Luebeck, Luebeck, 23538, Germany', u'Laboratory of Glycodesign and Glycoanalytics, Institute for Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Chemistry and Pathobiochemistry, Charit\xe9 \u2013 University Medicine Berlin, Berlin, 10117, Germany']]

[u'A domain sequence approach to pangenomics: applications to Escherichia coli', ['Lars-Gustav Snipen', 'David W Ussery'], u'29 May 2013', u'The study of microbial pangenomes relies on the computation of gene families, i.e. the clustering of coding sequences into groups of essentially similar genes. There is no standard approach to obtain such gene families. Ideally, the gene family computations should be robust against errors in the annotation of genes in various genomes. In an attempt to achieve this robustness, we propose to cluster sequences by their domain sequence, i.e. the ordered sequence of domains in their protein sequence. In a study of 347 genomes from Escherichia coli we find on average around 4500 proteins having hits in Pfam-A in every genome, clustering into around 2500 distinct domain sequence families in each genome. Across all genomes we find a total of 5724 such families. A binomial mixture model approach indicates this is around 95% of all domain sequences we would expect to see in E. coli in the future. A Heaps law analysis indicates the population of domain sequences is larger, but this analysis is also very sensitive to smaller changes in the computation procedure. The resolution between strains is good despite the coarse grouping obtained by domain sequence families. Clustering sequences by their ordered domain content give us domain sequence families, who are robust to errors in the gene prediction step. The computational load of the procedure scales linearly with the number of genomes, which is needed for the future explosion in the number of re-sequenced strains.

[u'Reconstructing a B-cell clonal lineage. I. Statistical inference of unobserved ancestors', ['Thomas B Kepler'], u'03 Apr 2013', u'One of the key phenomena in the adaptive immune response to infection and immunization is affinity maturation, during which antibody genes are mutated and selected, typically resulting in a substantial increase in binding affinity to the eliciting antigen. Advances in technology on several fronts have made it possible to clone large numbers of heavy-chain light-chain pairs from individual B cells and thereby identify whole sets of clonally related antibodies. These collections could provide the information necessary to reconstruct their own history - the sequence of changes introduced into the lineage during the development of the clone - and to study affinity maturation in detail. But the success of such a program depends entirely on accurately inferring the founding ancestor and the other unobserved intermediates. Given a set of clonally related immunoglobulin V-region genes, the method described here allows one to compute the posterior distribution over their possible ancestors, thereby giving a thorough accounting of the uncertainty inherent in the reconstruction.I demonstrate the application of this method on heavy-chain and light-chain clones, assess the reliability of the inference, and discuss the sources of uncertainty.', u'/articles/2-103/v1', ['Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases'], [u'Department of Microbiology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, 02118, USA', u'Department of Mathematics & Statistics, Boston University, Boston, MA, 02118, USA']]

Studies on repeated inoculation of Drosophila with microbes reveal a long-lasting cellular immunity adaptation against particular microorganisms. Here we study the lasting effect of immune priming against infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic human pathogen that is lethal to the common fruit fly. Drosophila priming with heat-killed or low in virulence P. aeruginosa extends fly survival during a secondary lethal infection with a virulent strain of the same species. The protective immune response can last for more than 10 days after exposure to a persistent low-in-virulence live infection, but it is eliminated 7 days after the host is primed with heat-killed bacteria. Moreover, not only the cellular, but also the systemic NF-\u03baB-mediated immune responses contribute to immune priming.

Here, the advantages of D. discoideum\r\nfor unraveling\r\nimportant biological functions of extracellular vesicles in general are\r\ndetailed. D. discoideum, a\nnon-pathogenic eukaryotic microorganism, belongs to a billion-year-old Amoeboza lineage, which diverged from\r\nthe animal-fungal lineage after the plant animal-split. During growth and early starvation-induced\r\ndevelopment, it presents analogies with lymphocytes and macrophages with regard\r\nto motility and phagocytosis capability, respectively. Its 6-chromosome genome\r\ncodes for about 12,500 genes, some showing analogies with human genes. The\r\npresence of extracellular vesicles during cell growth has been evidenced as a\r\ndetoxification mechanism of various structurally unrelated drugs. Controls led to the discovery of constitutive extracellular\r\nvesicle secretion in this microorganism, which was an important point. It means that the secretion of\r\nextracellular vesicles occurs, in the absence of any drug, during both cell\r\ngrowth and early development. This constitutive secretion of D. discoideum cells is very likely to\r\nplay a role in intercellular communication. The detoxifying\r\nsecreted vesicles, which can transport drugs outside\r\nthe cells, can also act as "Trojan horses", capable of transferring\r\nthese drugs not only into na\xefve D.\xa0discoideum cells, but into human cells as well.

Various complementary and alternative medicines are commonly used by IBD patients but there is much less data specifically on the use of probiotics.\xa0Aim: To examine the current use of probiotics by IBD patients and determine the factors associated with probiotic use.Methods: Subjects with IBD undergoing routine care at a UK teaching hospital underwent a standardized structured questionnaire-interview.

Logistical regression was used to explore factors associated with probiotic use.Results: Forty subjects were interviewed.\xa0 Probiotic use was common, 40% of subjects being regular users. Probiotic use was significantly associated with a shorter duration of IBD since diagnosis, a diagnosis of Crohn\u2019s disease, formal post-18 education and lower quality of life as assessed by the S-IBDQ.

The V. cholerae genome consists of two chromosomes; the smallest of these harbors a large gene capture and excision system called the superintegron (SI), of ~120 kbp. The flexible nature of the SI that results from gene cassette capture, deletion and rearrangement is thought to make it a hotspot of V. cholerae diversity, but beyond the basic structure it is not clear if there is a core genome in the SI and if so how it is structured. The aim of this study was to explore the core genome structure and the differences in gene content among strains of V. cholerae.Methods: From the complete genomes of seven V. cholerae and one Vibrio mimicus representative strains, we recovered the SI sequences based on the locations of the structural gene IntI4 and the V. cholerae repeats. Analysis of the pangenome, including cluster analysis of functional genes, pangenome profile analysis, genetic variation analysis of functional genes, strain evolution analysis and function enrichment analysis of gene clusters, was performed using a pangenome analysis pipeline in addition to the R scripts, splitsTree4 and genoPlotR.Results and conclusions: Here, we reveal the genetic architecture of the V. cholerae SI. It contains eight core genes when V. mimicus is included and 21 core genes when only V. cholerae strains are considered; many of them are present in several copies. The V. cholerae SI has an open pangenome, which means that V. cholerae may be able to import new gene cassettes to SI. The set of dispensable SI genes is influenced by the niche and type species.

CF airway epithelial cells (IB3-1, \u0394F508/W1282X) were cultured in appropriate media with supplements. WLBU-2 (25\u03bcM) was added to the media with RT-PCR measurement of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 transcripts after 20, 30, and 60min. Flow cytometry was used to determine if WLBU-2 assists in cellular uptake of Alexa 488-labeled LPS.Results: In murine lung exposed to intranasal or intraperitoneal WLBU-2, there was a reduction in the number of surviving PA colonies compared to controls. Murine lung exposed to intraperitoneal WLBU-2 showed fewer PA colonies compared to LL-37. After 24h WLBU-2 exposure, PA-induced IL-1\u03b2 transcripts from lungs showed a twofold decrease (p<0.05), while TNF-\u03b1 levels were unchanged. LL-37 did not significantly change transcript levels. In IB3-1 cells, WLBU-2 exposure resulted in increased TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 transcripts that decreased by 60min. WLBU-2 treatment of IB3-1 cells displayed increased LPS uptake, suggesting a potential role for CAPs in inducing protective proinflammatory responses. Taken together, the cytokine response, LPS uptake, and established antimicrobial activity of WLBU-2 demonstrate its ability to modulate proinflammatory signaling as a protective mechanism to clear infection.Conclusions: The immunomodulatory properties of WLBU-2 reveal a potential mechanism of its broad-spectrum antibacterial activity and warrant further preclinical evaluation to study bacterial clearance and rescue of chronic inflammation.', u'/articles/2-36/v1', ['Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'Eudowood Division of Pediatric Respiratory Sciences, Department of Pediatrics, John Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, 21287, USA', u'Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, 15261, USA', u'Center for Vaccine Research, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, 15261, USA', u'Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine, Seton Hill University, Greensburg, PA, 15601, USA']]

[u'Murine Tim-1 is excluded from the immunological synapse', ['Jean Lin', 'Leo Chen', 'Lawrence P Kane'], u'10 Oct 2012', u'The interaction between T cells and APCs bearing cognate antigen results in the formation of an immunological synapse (IS). During this process, many receptors and signaling proteins segregate to regions proximal to the synapse. This protein movement is thought to influence T cell function. However, some proteins are transported away from the IS, which is controlled in part by ERM family proteins. Tim-1 is a transmembrane protein with co-stimulatory functions that is found on many immune cells, including T cells. However, the expression pattern of Tim-1 on T cells upon activation by APCs has not been explored. Interestingly, in this study we demonstrate that the majority of Tim-1 on activated T cells is excluded from the IS. Tim-1 predominantly resides outside of the IS, and structure/function studies indicate that the cytoplasmic tail influences Tim-1 polarization. Specifically, a putative ERM binding motif (KRK 244-246) in the Tim-1 cytoplasmic tail appears necessary for proper Tim-1 localization. Furthermore, mutation of the KRK motif results in enhanced early tyrosine phosphorylation downstream of TCR/CD28 stimulation upon ectopic expression of Tim-1. Paradoxically however, the KRK motif is necessary for Tim-1 co-stimulation of NFAT/AP-1 activation and co-stimulation of cytokine production. This work reveals unexpected complexity underlying Tim-1 localization and suggests potentially novel mechanisms by which Tim-1 modulates T cell activity.', u'/articles/1-10/v2', ['Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases'], [u'University of Pittsburgh Medical Scientist Training Program and Graduate Program in Immunology, Pittsburgh, 15261, USA', u'Department of Immunology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, 15261, USA']]

[u'Recent advances in managing and understanding nephrolithiasis/nephrocalcinosis', ['Giovanni Gambaro', 'Alberto Trinchieri'], u'18 Apr 2016', u'Urinary stone disease is a very common disease whose prevalence is still increasing. Stone formation is frequently associated with other diseases of affluence such as hypertension, osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, and insulin resistance. The increasing concentration of lithogenic solutes along the different segments of the nephron involves supersaturation conditions leading to the formation, growth, and aggregation of crystals. Crystalline aggregates can grow free in the tubular lumen or coated on the wall of the renal tubule. Plugs of crystalline material have been highlighted in the tubular lumen in some patients, but crystalline growth starting from plaques of calcium phosphate within the renal papillae has been demonstrated in others. Urinary supersaturation is the result of a complex interaction between predisposing genetic features and environmental factors. Dietary intake is certainly the most important environmental risk factor. In particular, an insufficient intake of dietary calcium (<600 mg/day) can increase the intestinal absorption of oxalate and the risk of calcium oxalate stone formation. Other possible risk factors that have been identified include excessive intake of salt and proteins. The potential role of dietary acid load seems to play an important role in causing a state of subclinical chronic acidosis; therefore, the intake of vegetables is encouraged in stone-forming patients. Consumption of sugar-sweetened soda and punch is associated with a higher risk of stone formation, whereas consumption of coffee, tea, beer, wine, and orange juice is associated with a lower risk. A high fluid intake is widely recognized as the cornerstone of prevention of all forms of stones. The effectiveness of protein and salt restriction has been evaluated in some studies that still do not allow definitive conclusions to be made. Calcium stone formation can be prevented by the use of different drugs with different mechanisms of action (thiazide diuretics, allopurinol, and potassium citrate), but there is no ideal drug that is both risk free and well tolerated.', u'/articles/5-695/v1', ['Hepatology & Nephrology', 'Endocrinology & Gastroenterology', 'Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery', 'Urology, Gynecology & Obstetrics'], [u'Nephrology Division, Department of Internal Medicine and Medical Specialties, Columbus-Gemelli University Hospital, Rome, Italy', u'Urology Unit, Manzoni Hospital, Lecco, Italy']]

Their nephroprotective effect exceeds that attributable to lowering of blood pressure alone. This study examines the potential of ACEi to protect from progression of injury after a highly specific injury to podocytes in a mouse model.Methods: We created transgenic (Podo-DTR) mice in which graded specific podocyte injury could be induced by a single injection of diphtheria toxin. Transgenic and wild-type mice were given the ACEi captopril in drinking water, or water alone, commencing 24h after toxin injection. Kidneys were examined histologically at 8 weeks and injury assessed by observers blinded to experimental group.Results: After toxin injection, Podo-DTR mice developed acute proteinuria, and at higher doses transient renal impairment, which subsided within 3 weeks to be followed by a slow glomerular scarring process. Captopril treatment in Podo-DTR line 57 after toxin injection at 5ng/g body weight reduced proteinuria and ameliorated glomerular scarring, matrix accumulation and glomerulosclerosis almost to baseline (toxin: 17%; toxin + ACEi 10%, p<0.04; control 7% glomerular scarring). Podocyte counts were reduced after toxin treatment and showed no recovery irrespective of captopril treatment (7.1 and 7.3 podocytes per glomerular cross section in water and captopril-treated animals compared with 8.2 of wild-type controls, p<0.05).Conclusions: Observations in Podo-DTR mice support the hypothesis that continuing podocyte dysfunction is a key abnormality in proteinuric disease. Our model is ideal for studying strategies to protect the kidney from progressive injury following podocyte depletion.

[u'Case Report: Hyponatremia of malignancy \u2013 An alternative mechanism?\xa0Syndrome of inappropriate atrial natriuretic peptide (SIANP)', ['Steven Elias Mansoor', 'David I Kagen', 'Devan Kansagara'], u'16 Sep 2014', u'Euvolemic hyponatremia in the setting of lung cancer is most commonly due to the syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). However, a subset of patients with small cell carcinoma and hyponatremia also have elevated levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), which is produced by some small cell tumors. We report the case of a 64-year-old man with a limited-stage small cell carcinoma of the lung undergoing chemoradiation therapy, who was admitted to hospital with a pulmonary embolism. Two months earlier, at the time of diagnosis with lung cancer, he had a hypotonic, euvolemic hyponatremia, presumed to be caused by SIADH. At that time, his serum sodium readily normalized with fluid restriction and ADH-antagonist therapy with demeclocycline. However, during his second admission, the hyponatremia was refractory to treatment: his sodium level slowly declined from 138 mmol/L to a nadir of 118 mmol/L, despite early initiation of fluid restriction and maximal doses of demeclocycline. Laboratory values revealed a low but inappropriately non-zero level of ADH but also an inappropriately low level of aldosterone and an elevated level of ANP, suggesting that SIADH might not be the only contributor to the hyponatremia. While a causal link between ectopic ANP production and hyponatremia has never been established, an inappropriately high level of ANP can directly decrease sodium re-absorption in the proximal convoluted tubule of the kidney and increase glomerular filtration rate (GFR), resulting in greater excretion of sodium and water. In addition, high circulating levels of ANP can inhibit aldosterone secretion, potentially resulting in further sodium wasting. Here, the elevated ANP and inappropriately low aldosterone suggested the possibility that the refractory hyponatremia, although initiated by SIADH, was further worsened by an ANP-mediated natriuresis and suppression of aldosterone response.', u'/articles/3-195/v2', ['Hepatology & Nephrology', 'Endocrinology & Gastroenterology', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Knight Cardiovascular Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, 97239, USA', u'Department of Internal Medicine, Portland VA Medical Center, Portland, 97239, USA']]

We also studied alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and total bilirubin levels.Results: Early after transplantation, the peak median (interquartile range) GGT levels were significantly higher in patients who survived more than 90 days compared to non-survivors: 293 (178-464) vs. 172 (84-239) U/l, p<0.0001.

Here we demonstrate that a truncated version of the retinal-specific transmembrane enzyme ABCA4 is expressed in epidermal keratinocytes and is required for cellular proliferation and viability at late passage. This finding is of great importance for labs that wish to investigate the pathophysiology of novel ABCA4-variants, without having to incur the added expense and scientific expertise associated with iPSC generation, culture and differentiation. Likewise, this finding is also important for those intending to generate iPSCs from patient specific keratinocytes, which can prove difficult when ABCA4 mutations are present.', u'/articles/5-193/v1', ['Eye Disorders & ENT', 'Development & Evolution'], [u'Stephen A.

Recent experimental and computational studies revealed that complex features of external inputs may also be encoded by low-dimensional CANNs embedded in the high-dimensional space of neural population activity. The new experimental data also confirmed the existence of the M-shaped correlation between neuronal responses, which is a correlation structure associated with the unique dynamics of CANNs.

[u'From where to what: a neuroanatomically based evolutionary model of the emergence of speech in humans', ['Oren Poliva'], u'21 Jan 2016', u'In the brain of primates, the auditory cortex connects with the frontal lobe via the temporal pole (auditory ventral stream; AVS) and via the inferior parietal lobe (auditory dorsal stream; ADS). The AVS is responsible for sound recognition, and the ADS for sound-localization, voice detection and integration of calls with faces. I propose that the primary role of the ADS in non-human primates is the detection and response to contact calls. These calls are exchanged between tribe members (e.g., mother-offspring) and are used for monitoring location. Detection of contact calls occurs by the ADS identifying a voice, localizing it, and verifying that the corresponding face is out of sight. Once a contact call is detected, the primate produces a contact call in return via descending connections from the frontal lobe to a network of limbic and brainstem regions.Because the ADS of present day humans also performs speech production, I further propose an evolutionary course for the transition from contact call exchange to an early form of speech. In accordance with this model, structural changes to the ADS endowed early members of the genus Homo with partial vocal control. This development was beneficial as it enabled offspring to modify their contact calls with intonations for signaling high or low levels of distress to their mother. Eventually, individuals were capable of participating in yes-no question-answer conversations. In these conversations the offspring emitted a low-level distress call for inquiring about the safety of objects (e.g., food), and his/her mother responded with a high- or low-level distress call to signal approval or disapproval of the interaction. Gradually, the ADS and its connections with brainstem motor regions became more robust and vocal control became more volitional. Speech emerged once vocal control was sufficient for inventing novel calls.', u'/articles/4-67/v2', ['Eye Disorders & ENT', 'Development & Evolution', 'Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry', 'Plant Biology, Ecology & Environmental Sciences'], [u'Bangor University, Bangor, UK']]

Yong', 'Marjorie Rhodes', 'Kathryn Yee', 'Xiuyun Wu', 'Hannes F. Famira', 'Hormet Yiltiz'], u'19 Jan 2016', u'Crowding is a major limitation of visual perception. Because of crowding, a simple object, like a letter, can only be recognized if clutter is a certain critical spacing away. Crowding is only weakly associated with acuity. The critical spacing of crowding is lowest in the normal fovea, and grows with increasing eccentricity in peripheral vision. Foveal crowding is more prominent in certain patient groups, including those with strabismic amblyopia and apperceptive agnosia. Crowding may lessen with age during childhood as reading speed increases. The range of crowding predicts much of the slowness of reading in children with developmental dyslexia. There is tantalizing evidence suggesting that the critical spacing of crowding indicates neural density (participating neurons per square deg) in the visual cortex. Thus, for basic and applied reasons, it would be very interesting to measure foveal crowding clinically in children and adults with normal and impaired vision, and to track the development of crowding during childhood. While many labs routinely measure peripheral crowding as part of their basic research in visual perception, current tests are not well suited to routine clinical testing because they take too much time, require good fixation, and are mostly not applicable to foveal vision. Here we report a new test for clinical measurement of crowding in the fovea. It is quick and accurate, works well with children and adults, and we expect it to work well with dementia patients as well. The task is to identify a numerical digit, 1-9, using a new \u201cPelli\u201d font that is identifiable at tiny width (0.02 deg, about 1 minarc, in normal adult fovea).

Quantitative sensory testing showed that sensory thresholds to mechanical stimulation of the dorsum of both feet had increased more than 10-fold on both sides compared with tests performed before her pregnancy. These findings fulfill the diagnostic criteria for neuropathic pain. Notably, she mostly only experiences the negative symptoms (such as numbness and tingling, but also electric shocks), and she has not reported sharp or burning sensations, although the value of verbal descriptors is somewhat limited in a person who has never felt pain before. However, her case strongly suggests that at least some of the symptoms of neuropathic pain can persist despite the absence of the Nav1.7 channel.

Intriguingly, traps baited with 1-octen-3-ol captured significantly more females of the malaria mosquito, Anopheles gambiae, and the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti, than control traps, but failed to attract the southern house mosquito, Culex quinquefasciatus. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that this attractant is detected with enantioselective odorant receptors (ORs) expressed only in maxillary palps. On the basis of indoor behavioral assays it has even been suggested that 1-octen-3-ol might be a repellent to the southern house mosquito. Our approach was two-prong, i.e., to isolate 1-octen-3-ol-sensitive ORs expressed in maxillary palps and antennae of southern house female mosquito, and test the hypothesis that this semiochemical is a repellent. An OR with high transcript levels in maxillary palps, CquiOR118b, showed remarkable selectivity towards (R)-1-octen-3-ol, whereas an OR expressed in antennae, CquiOR114b, showed higher preference for (S)-1-octen-3-ol than its antipode. Repellency by a surface landing and feeding assay showed that not only racemic, but enantiopure (R)- and (S)-1-octen-3-ol are repellents at 1% dose thus suggesting the occurrence of other (S)-1-octen-3-ol-sensitive OR(s).

Chronic pain is associated with increased incidence of anxio-depressive disorders, and patients often report feelings of vulnerability which can decrease quality of life. In animal models of pain, observation of behaviours such as thigmotaxis can be used to detect such affective disturbances by exploiting the influence of nociceptive stimuli on the innate behavioural conflict between exploration of a novel space and predator avoidance behaviour. This study investigates whether acute and repeated bladder inflammation in adult female Wistar rats increases thigmotactic behaviour in the open field paradigm, and aims to determine whether this correlates with activation in the central amygdala, as measured by c-Fos immunoreactivity. Additionally, up-regulation of inflammatory mediators in the urinary bladder was measured using RT-qPCR array featuring 92 transcripts to examine how local mediators change under experimental conditions. We found acute but not repeated turpentine inflammation of the bladder increased thigmotactic behaviour (decreased frequency of entry to the inner zone) in the open field paradigm, a result that was also observed in the catheter-only instrumentation group. Decreases in locomotor activity were also observed in both models in turpentine and instrumentation groups. No differences were observed in c-Fos activation, although a general increased in activation along the rostro-caudal axis was seen. Inflammatory mediator up-regulation was greatest following acute inflammation, with CCL12, CCL7, and IL-1\u03b2 significantly up-regulated in both conditions when compared to na\xefve tissue.

Then, OBPs transport these hydrophobic compounds through an aqueous sensillar lymph to receptors embedded on dendritic membranes of olfactory receptor neurons. Structures of OBPs from mosquito species have shed new light on the mechanism of transport, although there is considerable debate on how they deliver odorant to receptors. An OBP from the southern house mosquito, Culex quinquefasciatus, binds the hydrophobic moiety of a mosquito oviposition pheromone (MOP) on the edge of its binding cavity. Likewise, it has been demonstrated that the orthologous protein from the malaria mosquito binds the insect repellent DEET on a similar edge of its binding pocket. A high school research project was aimed at testing whether the orthologous protein from the yellow fever mosquito, AaegOBP1, binds DEET and other insect repellents, and MOP was used as a positive control.

However, titration of NPN fluorescence emission in AaegOBP1 solution with MOP led to unexpected and intriguing results.

Our 2-mechanism model predicts that aftereffects will still be observed when returning to the original environment, indicating a lack of skill transfer from the artificial environment to the original environment. To illustrate the model prediction, we tested 10 healthy participants on the interaction between a simple overlearned motor skill (straight hand movements to targets in different directions) and an artificially altered visuomotor environment (rotation of visual feedback of the results of movement).\xa0 As predicted by the models, participants show adaptation to the altered environment and after-effects on return to the baseline environment even when practice in the altered environment should have led to correct skill performance. \xa0The presence of aftereffect under all conditions that involved changes in environment demonstrates separation of environmental adaptation and skill learning.

In older patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), however, hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is known to occur but has not previously been reported to be associated with CNV regression. This report describes the clinical course of a case series of AMD patients with pigment hypertrophy adjacent to CNV associated with stabilization of the CNV lesion.Methods: A retrospective analysis of exudative AMD patients seen by a single retina specialist over a 7-year period.Results: Retrospective analysis of 955 exudative AMD patients revealed pigment hypertrophy associated with CNV in 33 patients. A ring of pigment surrounded CNV in 6 of these. Three representative patients are presented to illustrate the decrease in macular edema, reduced fluorescein leakage and slowed CNV progression that was associated with a pigment ring around CNV in AMD. Pigment hypertrophy was associated with blocked fluorescein leakage and exudative AMD patients with a complete pigment ring maintained stable visual acuity, macular edema, fluorescein leakage and CNV lesion size without treatment for intervals of up to 21 months.\xa0Conclusion: \xa0We report slowed disease progression in AMD patients who develop pigment around CNV.

Ca2+ influx via the NMDAR triggers CaMKII binding to the NMDAR for enhanced CaMKII accumulation at post-synaptic sites that experience heightened activity as occurring during LTP. Previously, we generated knock-in (KI) mice in which we replaced two residues in the NMDAR GluN2B subunit to impair CaMKII binding to GluN2B. Various forms of LTP at the Schaffer collateral synapses in CA1 are reduced by 50%. Nevertheless, working memory in the win-shift 8 arm maze and learning of the Morris water maze (MWM) task was normal in the KI mice although recall of the task was impaired in these mice during the period of early memory consolidation. We now show that massed training in the MWM task within a single day resulted in impaired learning. However, learning and recall of the Barnes maze task and contextual fear conditioning over one or multiple days were surprisingly unaffected. The differences observed in the MWM compared to the Barnes maze and contextual fear conditioning suggest a differential involvement of CaMKII and the specific interaction with GluN2B, probably depending on varying degrees of stress, cognitive demand or even potentially different plasticity mechanisms associated with the diverse tasks.', u'/articles/3-193/v1', ['Eye Disorders & ENT', 'Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry'], [u'Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, University of California, Davis, CA, 95616-8636, USA']]

The degree of sensorimotor gating can be studied behaviorally by indexing prepulse inhibition (PPI). PPI reflects the degree of suppression of a startle response to an intense sensory stimulus when it is preceded by a more modest sensory stimulus. The neural circuitry underlying PPI has been shown to include dopaminergic and cholinergic systems. We previously found that histaminergic H1 receptors also play important roles in sensorimotor gating: the acute administration of the histamine H1 antagonist, pyrilamine, significantly reverses the PPI impairment caused by the NMDA glutamate antagonist, dizocilpine (MK-801). The current study was conducted to determine the anatomic bases for histaminergic and cholinergic regulation of the effect of NMDA antagonism on PPI.\xa0 Using autoradiography, we found that pyrilamine treatment decreased H1 receptor binding in the anterior cingulate, which correlated with PPI improvement.\xa0 Furthermore, we found that pyrilamine treatment resulted in increased \u03b17-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor binding in the insular cortex, which also correlated with PPI improvement.\xa0 These findings shed light on the interaction between histamine and acetylcholine signaling in a distributed network of PPI modulation.', u'/articles/3-136/v1', ['Eye Disorders & ENT', 'Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry'], [u'Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA 02118, USA', u'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA']]

Similar negativity has been documented in monkeys and cats, but it is controversial whether mismatch negativity also exists in awake rodents. To this end, we recorded cortical and hippocampal evoked responses in rats during alert immobility under a typical passive oddball paradigm that yields mismatch negativity in humans. The standard stimulus was a 9 kHz tone and the deviant either 7 or 11 kHz tone in the first condition. We found no evidence of a sustained potential shift when comparing evoked responses to standard and deviant stimuli. Instead, we found repetition-induced attenuation of the P60 component of the combined evoked response in the cortex, but not in the hippocampus. The attenuation extended over three days of recording and disappeared after 20 intervening days of rest. Reversal of the standard and deviant tones resulted is a robust enhancement of the N40 component not only in the cortex but also in the hippocampus. Responses to standard and deviant stimuli were affected similarly. Finally, we tested the effect of scopolamine in this paradigm. Scopolamine attenuated cortical N40 and P60 as well as hippocampal P60 components, but had no specific effect on the deviant response.

However, although animal studies have consistently shown increased neural activity in auditory structures after hearing loss, tinnitus does not always develop. It has therefore been suggested that non-auditory structures perform a gating or regulatory role that determines whether the increased activity in auditory structures leads to conscious perception. Recent evidence points to the paraflocculus of the cerebellum as having such a role. Therefore, we investigated the early effects of hearing loss on gene expression in guinea pig paraflocculus. Gene expression was investigated after two weeks recovery from either acoustic or mechanical cochlear trauma. The genes investigated in our study were associated with inhibitory neurotransmission (GABA-A receptor subunit alpha 1; glutamate decarboxylase 1), excitatory neurotransmission (glutamate receptor NMDA subunit 1), and regulation of transmitter release (member of RAB family of small GTPase). Our results show increased mRNA levels of glutamate decarboxylase 1 in ipsilateral paraflocculus with no difference between the different methods of cochlear trauma.

The reflex is formed by action-based sensory encoding during the early post-natal developmental period, and it is unknown if the protective motor function of the nociceptive withdrawal reflex in the human upper-limb is adaptable based on the configuration of the arm or if it can be modified by short-term practice of a similar or opposing motor action. In the present study, nociceptive withdrawal reflexes were evoked by a brief train of electrical stimuli applied to digit II, 1) in five different static arm positions and, 2) before and after motor practice that was opposite (EXT) or similar (FLEX) to the stereotyped withdrawal response, in 10 individuals. Withdrawal responses were quantified by the electromyography (EMG) reflex response in several upper limb muscles, and by the forces and moments recorded at the wrist. EMG onset latencies and response amplitudes were not significantly different across the arm positions or between the EXT and FLEX practice conditions, and the general direction of the withdrawal response was similar across arm positions. In addition, the force vectors were not different after practice in either the practice condition or between EXT and FLEX conditions. We conclude the withdrawal response is insensitive to changes in elbow or shoulder joint angles as well as remaining resistant to short-term adaptations from the practice of motor actions, resulting in a generalized limb withdrawal in each case. It is further hypothesized that the multisensory feedback is weighted differently in each arm position, but integrated to achieve a similar withdrawal response to safeguard against erroneous motor responses that could cause further harm.

We found that CK8-positive cells and FM1-43-positive cells were mainly located in the stromal layer, but not in the epithelial basal layer, of the forniceal conjunctiva. Our TEM results indicate that these cells possess the unique characteristic structures of Merkel cells, including electron-dense membrane-surrounded granules and spine-like protrusions of variable lengths, and demonstrate the formation of Merkel cell-neurite complexes. After corneal epithelial wounding, these cells exhibited rapid cell shrinkage and nuclear lobulation.

[u'No psychological effect of color context in\xa0a low level vision task', ['Adam Pedley', 'Alex R Wade'], u'15 Nov 2013', u'Background: A remarkable series of recent papers have shown that colour can influence performance in cognitive tasks. In particular, they suggest that viewing a participant number printed in red ink or other red ancillary stimulus elements improves performance in tasks requiring local processing and impedes performance in tasks requiring global processing whilst the reverse is true for the colour blue. The tasks in these experiments require high level cognitive processing such as analogy solving or remote association tests and the chromatic effect on local vs. global processing is presumed to involve widespread activation of the autonomic nervous system. If this is the case, we might expect to see similar effects on all local vs. global task comparisons. To test this hypothesis, we asked whether chromatic cues also influence performance in tasks involving low level visual feature integration.Methods: Subjects performed either local (contrast detection) or global (form detection) tasks on achromatic dynamic Glass pattern stimuli. Coloured instructions, target frames and fixation points were used to attempt to bias performance to different task types. Based on previous literature, we hypothesised that red cues would improve performance in the (local) contrast detection task but would impede performance in the (global) form detection task.\xa0Results: A two-way, repeated measures, analysis of covariance (2\xd72 ANCOVA) with gender as a covariate, revealed no influence of colour on either task, F(1,29) = 0.289, p = 0.595, partial \u03b72 = 0.002. Additional analysis revealed no significant differences in only the first attempts of the tasks or in the improvement in performance between trials.Discussion: We conclude that motivational processes elicited by colour perception do not influence neuronal signal processing in the early visual system, in stark contrast to their putative effects on processing in higher areas.', u'/articles/2-247/v1', ['Eye Disorders & ENT', 'Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry'], [u'Department of Psychology, University of York, York, YO10 5DD, UK']]
[u'Prism adaptation does not alter object-based attention in healthy participants', ['Janet H. Bultitude', 'Alexandra List', 'Anne M. Aimola Davies'], u'04 Nov 2013', u'Hemispatial neglect (\u2018neglect\u2019) is a disabling condition that can follow damage to the right side of the brain, in which patients show difficulty in responding to or orienting towards objects and events that occur on the left side of space. Symptoms of neglect can manifest in both space- and object-based frames of reference. Although patients can show a combination of these two forms of neglect, they are considered separable and have distinct neurological bases. In recent years considerable evidence has emerged to demonstrate that spatial symptoms of neglect can be reduced by an intervention called prism adaptation. Patients point towards objects viewed through prismatic lenses that shift the visual image to the right. Approximately five minutes of repeated pointing results in a leftward recalibration of pointing and improved performance on standard clinical tests for neglect. The understanding of prism adaptation has also been advanced through studies of healthy participants, in whom adaptation to leftward prismatic shifts results in temporary neglect-like performance. Here we examined the effect of prism adaptation on the performance of healthy participants who completed a computerised test of space- and object-based attention. Participants underwent adaptation to leftward- or rightward-shifting prisms, or performed neutral pointing according to a between-groups design. Significant pointing after-effects were found for both prism groups, indicating successful adaptation. In addition, the results of the computerised test revealed larger reaction-time costs associated with shifts of attention between two objects compared to shifts of attention within the same object, replicating previous work. However there were no differences in the performance of the three groups, indicating that prism adaptation did not influence space- or object-based attention for this task.

[u'Prism adaptation does not alter configural processing of faces', ['Janet H. Bultitude', 'Paul E. Downing', 'Robert D. Rafal'], u'14 Oct 2013', u'Patients with hemispatial neglect (\u2018neglect\u2019) following a brain lesion show difficulty responding or orienting to objects and events on the left side of space. Substantial evidence supports the use of a sensorimotor training technique called prism adaptation as a treatment for neglect. Reaching for visual targets viewed through prismatic lenses that induce a rightward shift in the visual image results in a leftward recalibration of reaching movements that is accompanied by a reduction of symptoms in patients with neglect. The understanding of prism adaptation has also been advanced through studies of healthy participants, in whom adaptation to leftward prismatic shifts results in temporary neglect-like performance. Interestingly, prism adaptation can also alter aspects of non-lateralised spatial attention. We previously demonstrated that prism adaptation alters the extent to which neglect patients and healthy participants process local features versus global configurations of visual stimuli. Since deficits in non-lateralised spatial attention are thought to contribute to the severity of neglect symptoms, it is possible that the effect of prism adaptation on these deficits contributes to its efficacy. This study examines the pervasiveness of the effects of prism adaptation on perception by examining the effect of prism adaptation on configural face processing using a composite face task. The composite face task is a persuasive demonstration of the automatic global-level processing of faces: the top and bottom halves of two familiar faces form a seemingly new, unknown face when viewed together. Participants identified the top or bottom halves of composite faces before and after prism adaptation. Sensorimotor adaptation was confirmed by significant pointing aftereffect, however there was no significant change in the extent to which the irrelevant face half interfered with processing. The results support the proposal that the therapeutic effects of prism adaptation are limited to dorsal stream processing.', u'/articles/2-215/v1', ['Eye Disorders & ENT', 'Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry'], [u'Oxford Centre for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain (FMRIB), Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 9DU, UK', u'Wolfson Centre for Clinical and Cognitive Neuroscience, School of Psychology, Bangor University, Gwynedd, LL57 2AS, UK']]
[u'Tectal etiology for irrepressible saccades: a case study in a Rhesus monkey', ['James W Gnadt', 'Christopher T Noto', 'Jagmeet S Kanwal'], u'10 Sep 2013', u'Brain circuits controlling eye movements are widely distributed and complex. The etiology of irrepressible square wave saccades is not fully understood and is likely different for different neuropathologies. In a previous study, spontaneously occurring irrepressible saccades were noted after a cerebrovascular accident that damaged the rostral superior colliculus (SC) and its commissure in a Rhesus monkey. Here, we tracked and quantified the development of similar symptoms in a Rhesus monkey caused by a lesion in the rostromedial SC and its commissure. We documented the changes in these saccadic intrusions while the monkey attempted fixation of a target on three consecutive days post-onset. On the first day, eye jerk amplitude was ~10 degrees and the direction was ~30 degrees above the left horizontal meridian. On the second day, the amplitude decreased to 6.5 degrees and the direction shifted towards vertical, ~20 degrees to the left of the vertical meridian. Size, but not direction, of the eye jerks continued to decrease until intrusions dissipated within one month. Histological examination after ~6 months from the first appearance of the intrusions revealed a lesion in the commissure of the SC. Results from this and the previous study confirm the involvement of the commissure of the SC as the common target for triggering this neuropathy. Our data suggest that commissural fibers play an important role in maintaining normal visual stability. Interrupting the commissure between the two superior colliculi causes saccadic intrusions in the form of irrepressible jerking of the eyes, probably by disrupting inhibitory signals transmitted through the commissure. Furthermore, disappearance of the symptoms suggests that inhibitory fields within the SC are plastic and can expand, possibly via inputs from inter-collicular and nigrotectal pathways.', u'/articles/2-85/v2', ['Eye Disorders & ENT', 'Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry'], [u'Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Georgetown University School of Medicine, Washington DC, 20057, USA', u'Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Howard University College of Medicine, Washington DC, 20059, USA', u'Department of Neurology, Georgetown University School of Medicine, Washington DC, 20057, USA']]

More specifically, the relative benefits of novel auditory-visual and verbal-visual associations for learning have not been directly compared. In Experiment 1, 20 adult volunteers completed three paired associate learning tasks: non-verbal novel auditory-visual (novel-AV), verbal-visual (verbal-AV; using pseudowords), and visual-visual (shape-VV). Participants were directed to make a motor response to matching novel and arbitrarily related stimulus pairs. Feedback was provided to facilitate trial and error learning. The results of Signal Detection Theory analyses suggested a multisensory enhancement of learning, with significantly higher discriminability measures (d-prime) in both the novel-AV and verbal-AV tasks than the shape-VV task. Motor reaction times were also significantly faster during the verbal-AV task than during the non-verbal learning tasks. \xa0Experiment 2 (n = 12) used a forced-choice discrimination paradigm to assess whether a difference in unisensory stimulus discriminability could account for the learning trends in Experiment 1.

[u'The Binding Ring Illusion: assimilation affects the perceived size of a circular array', ['J Daniel McCarthy', 'Colin Kupitz', 'Gideon P Caplovitz'], u'25 Apr 2013', u'Our perception of an object\u2019s size arises from the integration of multiple sources of visual information including retinal size, perceived distance and its size relative to other objects in the visual field. This constructive process is revealed through a number of classic size illusions such as the Delboeuf Illusion, the Ebbinghaus Illusion and others illustrating size constancy. Here we present a novel variant of the Delbouef and Ebbinghaus size illusions that we have named the Binding Ring Illusion. The illusion is such that the perceived size of a circular array of elements is underestimated when superimposed by a circular contour \u2013 a binding ring \u2013 and overestimated when the binding ring slightly exceeds the overall size of the array. Here we characterize the stimulus conditions that lead to the illusion, and the perceptual principles that underlie it. Our findings indicate that the perceived size of an array is susceptible to the assimilation of an explicitly defined superimposed contour. Our results also indicate that the assimilation process takes place at a relatively high level in the visual processing stream, after different spatial frequencies have been integrated and global shape has been constructed. We hypothesize that the Binding Ring Illusion arises due to the fact that the size of an array of elements is not explicitly defined and therefore can be influenced (through a process of assimilation) by the presence of a superimposed object that does have an explicit size.', u'/articles/2-58/v2', ['Eye Disorders & ENT', 'Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry'], [u'Department of Psychology, University of Nevada Reno, Reno, NV, 89557, USA']]

[u'Reactive microglia after taste nerve injury: comparison to nerve injury models of chronic pain', ['Dianna L Bartel', 'Thomas E Finger'], u'28 Feb 2013', u'The chorda tympani (CT), which innervates taste buds on the anterior portion of the tongue, is susceptible to damage during inner ear surgeries. Injury to the CT causes a disappearance of taste buds, which is concurrent with significant microglial responses at central nerve terminals in the nucleus of the solitary tract (nTS). The resulting taste disturbances that can occur may persist for months or years, long after the nerve and taste buds have regenerated. These persistent changes in taste sensation suggest alterations in central functioning and may be related to the microglial responses. This is reminiscent of nerve injuries that result in chronic pain, where microglial reactivity is essential in maintaining the altered sensation (i.e., pain). In these models, methods that diminish microglial responses also diminish the corresponding pain behavior. Although the CT nerve does not contain nociceptive pain fibers, the microglial reactivity after CT damage is similar to that described in pain models. Therefore, methods that decrease microglial responses in pain models were used here to test if they could also affect microglial reactivity after CT injury. Treatment with minocycline, an antibiotic that dampens pain responsive microglia, was largely ineffective in diminishing microglial responses after CT injury. In addition, signaling through the toll-like 4 receptor (TLR4) does not seem to be required after CT injury as blocking or deleting TLR4 had no effect on microglial reactivity.

Portal venous glucose concentration is also raised, thereby retarding the passive component of intestinal glucose absorption.\xa0\xa0Increased pre-hepatic sinusoidal resistance combined with portal hypertension leading to opening of intrahepatic portosystemic collateral vessels are NASH-related mechanical defects that alter the balance between splanchnic and systemic distributions of glucose, hormones and incretins.The model reveals the latent contribution of portosystemic shunting in development of metabolic disease. This diverts splanchnic blood content away from the hepatic sinuses to the systemic circulation, particularly during the glucose absorptive phase of digestion, resulting in inappropriate increases in insulin-dependent systemic glucose metabolism.\xa0 This hastens onset of hypoglycaemia and thence hyperglucagonaemia. The model reveals that low rates of GLP-1 secretion, frequently associated with T2DM and NASH, may be also be caused by splanchnic hypoglycaemia, rather than to intrinsic loss of incretin secretory capacity.

[u'The importance of selecting the appropriate reference genes for quantitative real time PCR as illustrated using colon cancer cells and tissue', ['Catriona M. Dowling', 'Dara Walsh', 'John C. Coffey', 'Patrick A. Kiely'], u'09 Mar 2016', u'Quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) remains the most sensitive technique for nucleic acid quantification. Its popularity is reflected in the remarkable number of publications reporting RT-qPCR data. Careful normalisation within RT-qPCR studies is imperative to ensure accurate quantification of mRNA levels. This is commonly achieved through the use of reference genes as an internal control to normalise the mRNA levels between different samples. The selection of appropriate reference genes can be a challenge as transcript levels vary with physiology, pathology and development, making the information within the transcriptome flexible and variable. In this study, we examined the variation in expression of a panel of nine candidate reference genes in HCT116 and HT29 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional cultures, as well as in normal and cancerous colon tissue. Using normfinder we identified the top three most stable genes for all conditions. Further to this we compared the change in expression of a selection of PKC coding genes when the data was normalised to one reference gene and three reference genes. Here we demonstrated that there is a variation in the fold changes obtained dependent on the number of reference genes used. As well as this, we highlight important considerations namely; assay efficiency tests, inhibition tests and RNA assessment which should also be implemented into all RT-qPCR studies.

CEC levels were tested by Janssen Diagnostics, LLC using an immuno-magnetic bead-based assay. CEC levels were compared to levels in a previously tested normal population. Correlations between CEC levels and other vascular injury markers (urine albumin, von-Willebrand factor antigen, hs-CRP, uric acid) were performed.ResultsPatients included 40 adults of which nineteen were normoalbuminuric.\xa0 Mean CEC levels (38.7, SD 38.1 cells) were significantly higher than the normal population (M = 21\xb118 cells, p<0.001; N = 249), including in the normoalbuminuric subgroup (M = 42.9\xb142.5 cells, p<0.001).

The fundamental importance in fetal development of the endogenous activation of this endocrine axis at the end of gestation has led to the use of glucocorticoids for reducing neonatal morbidity in premature infants. However, the choice of dose and repetition of treatments has been controversial, raising the possibility that excess glucocorticoid might program an increased incidence of adult disease (e.g., coronary artery disease and diabetes).

In healthy men a circadian variation in rectal perception to colonic distention was described. Disturbed day and night rhythms, which occur in shift work and trans meridian flights, are associated with the prevalence of IBS. This raises the question whether disruptions of circadian control are responsible for the observed pathology in IBS. Prior to investigating altered rhythmicity in relation to visceral hypersensitivity in a rat model for IBS, it is relevant to establish whether normal rats display circadian variation similar to healthy men.\xa0Methodology and findings: In rodents colorectal distension leads to reproducible contractions of abdominal musculature. We used quantification of this so called visceromotor response (VMR) by electromyography (EMG) to assess visceral sensitivity in rats. We assessed the VMR in normal male Long Evans rats at different time points of the light/dark cycle. Although a control experiment with male maternal separated rats confirmed that intentionally inflicted (i.e. stress induced) changes in VMR can be detected, normal male Long Evans rats showed no variation in VMR along the light/dark cycle in response to colorectal distension.Conclusions: In the absence of a daily rhythm of colorectal sensitivity in normal control rats it is not possible to investigate possible aberrancies in our rat model for IBS.', u'/articles/5-98/v1', ['Endocrinology & Gastroenterology', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Tytgat Institute for Liver and Intestinal research, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands', u'Department of Neurobiology, Tongji Medical College, HUST, Wuhan, China', u'Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands']]

Compared to systemic chemotherapy, HIPEC improves survival in patients with PC. This therapy has high morbidity rates (up to 41%). In vitro it has been demonstrated that hyperthermia has a toxic effect on malign cells. However, hyperthermia also affects normal tissue. To my knowledge, any additional effect of hyperthermia combined with chemotherapy has never been demonstrated in a clinical setting. In this study, the effects of hyperthermia on outcome and survival were analyzed.Methods: Patients with PC from any origin who were treated with HIPEC were included in this retrospective, non-randomized study. Data on patient characteristics, tumor characteristics, features of the surgery and postoperative complications were extracted from patient files. Models predicting time to removal of nasogastric tube (TRNT), post-operative major complications, the occurrence of anastomotic leaks and post-operative survival were built, using negative binomial regression, logistic regression or Cox proportional hazards regression as appropriate.Results: 138 patients treated with HIPEC were included. Maximal temperature during the operation was not statistically significantly associated with anastomotic leaks or post-operative major complications. Maximal temperature during the operation was negatively associated with post-operative survival (P=0.01).Conclusion: The results suggest that hyperthermia may negatively affect survival in patients who are treated with HIPEC for PC of various origins.

However, the exact orchestration of this association is not fully understood. Herein is described a meta-analysis performed based on a belief that such an approach could shed some light as to the role of genetic & epigenetic influences in the etiology of type-2 diabetes.Methodology/principal findings: The study incorporated reports identified from PubMed, Medline, & Google Scholar databases for eligible case-control studies that assessed dermatoglyphics in type-2 diabetes cases relative to controls. Over 44,000 fingerprints & 2300 palm prints from around 4400 individuals were included in the analysis. Decreased loops patterns [OR= 0.76; 95% CI= (0.59, 0.98)], increased non-loop patterns [OR= 1.31; 95% CI= (1.02, 1.68)], and reduced absolute finger ridge counts [OR= -0.19; 95% CI= (-0.33, -0.04)] were significant findings among the diabetic group. These results are indicative of mild developmental deviances, with epigenetic insults significantly linked to early gestation wherein critical events &signaling pathways of the endocrine pancreas development are witnessed. Further, the increased loop patterns with decreased non-loop patterns were deemed as possible indicators of decreased genomic heterozygosity with concurrently increased homozygosity in the diabetic group, linked to reduced buffering capacities during prenatal development.Conclusions: Epigenetic insults primarily during the 1st trimester, to a lesser extent between the early-to-mid 2ndtrimester, but least likely linked to those beyond the mid-second trimester are evident in type-2 diabetes.

To study ENS cell ganglionation we isolated midgut ENS cells by HNK-1 fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from E5 and E8 quail embryos, and from E9 chick embryos. We performed cell-cell aggregation assays which revealed a developmentally regulated functional increase in ENS cell adhesive function, requiring both Ca2+ -dependent and independent adhesion. This was consistent with N-cadherin and NCAM labelling. Neurons sorted to the core of aggregates, surrounded by outer ENC cells, showing that neurons had higher adhesion than ENC cells. The outer surface of aggregates became relatively non-adhesive, correlating with low levels of NCAM and N-cadherin on this surface of the outer non-neuronal ENC cells. Aggregation assays showed that ENS cells FACS selected for NCAM-high and enriched for enteric neurons formed larger and more coherent aggregates than unsorted ENS cells. In contrast, ENS cells of the NCAM-low FACS fraction formed small, disorganised aggregates.\xa0 This suggests a novel mechanism for control of ENS ganglion morphogenesis where i) differential adhesion of ENS neurons and ENC cells controls the core/shell ganglionic structure and ii) the ratio of neurons to ENC cells dictates the equilibrium ganglion size by generation of an outer non-adhesive surface.', u'/articles/4-113/v1', ['Endocrinology & Gastroenterology', 'Development & Evolution', 'Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology'], [u"Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Royal Children's Hospital, Victoria, 3052, Australia"]]

It was reported that, in a manner divergent from similar mutants, GHR-KO mice fail to respond to caloric restriction (CR) by altering their insulin sensitivity.

While genomics data have been heavily used, protein signaling data are more directly connected to biological phenotype and might predict cancer phenotypessuch as invasion, metastasis, and patient survival. In this study, we mined publicly available data for colorectal adenocarcinoma from the Cancer Genome Atlas and identified protein expression and signaling changes that are statistically associated with patient outcome. Our analysis identified a number of known and potentially new regulators of colorectal cancer. High levels of insulin growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP2) were associated with both recurrence and death, and this was validated by immunohistochemical staining of a tissue microarray for a secondary patient dataset. Interestingly, GATA binding protein 3 (GATA3) was the protein most frequently associated with death in our analysis, and GATA3 expression was significantly decreased in tumor samples from stage I-II deceased patients. Experimental studies using engineered colon cancer cell lines show that exogenous expression of GATA3 decreases three-dimensional colony growth and invasiveness of colon cancer cells but does not affect two-dimensional proliferation. These findings suggest that protein data are useful for biomarker discovery and identify GATA3 as a regulator of colorectal cancer\xa0 aggressiveness.', u'/articles/4-99/v1', ['Endocrinology & Gastroenterology', 'Oncology & Hematology', 'Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'Department of Cancer Biology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, 37232, USA', u'Department of Biostatistics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, 37232, USA', u'Center for Quantitative Sciences, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, 37232, USA', u'Department of Pathology,Microbiology, and Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, 37232, USA', u'Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, 37232, USA', u'Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, 37232, USA', u'Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, 37232, USA', u'Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Nashville, TN, 37232, USA', u'Department of Surgery, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, 37232, USA', u'Vanderbilt Ingram Cancer Center, Nashville, TN, 37232, USA']]

Radiofrequency (RF), non-contact, selective-field device Vanquish\xae has been developed to selectively induce deep fat tissue heating to reduce waist circumference. Our analysis evaluates immediate and sustained effects of this treatment on cardiovascular autonomic function and on selected metabolic parameters.Study design/patients and methods: A retrospective proof-of-concept analysis of RF treatment effects was conducted in 20 individuals with metabolic syndrome, to reduce the subcutaneous abdominal fat. Four 30-minutes treatment sessions (manufacturer\xb4s standard protocol) were performed in 1-week intervals. Vital signs, ECG, lab screening, body composition, subcutaneous fat thickness and spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) have been examined before, after the 1st and 4th treatment, and at follow-up visits 1 month and 3 months after the treatment.Results: The RF treatment led to a significant reduction of abdominal circumference after the 4th session (p<0.001), and during follow-up after 1 and 3 months (p<0.001 and p<0.02, resp.). There was a significant correlation (r=-0.58, p=0.007) between reduction of abdominal circumference and initial very-low frequency (VLF) spectral power at 1 month follow-up. A significant increase of cumulative spectral power in low frequency (p=0.02) and reduction in high frequency (p=0.05) band have been observed immediately (20+14 minutes) after the treatment. On the contrary, no sustained impact on autonomic balance has been recorded 39+18 days after the treatment. A significant correlation between the initial adiponectin values and immediate autonomic response to one treatment was observed in VLF and total spectral bands (r>0.59, p<0.04).Conclusions: Our analysis shows that the selective-field RF treatment is safe and efficient for reduction of subcutaneous abdominal fat. While the treatment increases the immediate sympathetic response of the body to deep tissue heating, no sustained change in autonomic function could be recorded at 1 month follow-up. The observed correlation between initial VLF spectral power and waist circumference reduction at follow-up, as well as the association of initial adiponectin values and immediate autonomic response to the treatment might be instrumental for decisions on body contouring strategies.', u'/articles/4-49/v1', ['Endocrinology & Gastroenterology'], [u'International Research Group Functional Rehabilitation & Group Education, Vienna, 1090, Austria', u'Vila Krasy Aesthetic Centre, Internal Medicine Outpatient Clinic, Olomouc, 779 00, Czech Republic', u'Center of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, Medical University Vienna, Vienna, 1090, Austria', u'Internal Medicine/Diabetology Clinic, Prevention and Aesthetics Centre, Vienna, 1170, Austria', u'Department of Internal Medicine I and Department of Sports Medicine and Cardiovascular Rehabilitation, University Palacky Medical School, Olomouc, 771 47, Czech Republic']]

One such example is the dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP4) inhibitor used for treating type 2 diabetes, which is inconclusively implicated in increased susceptibility to acute pancreatitis. Previously, based on a computational analysis of the spatial and electrostatic properties of active site residues, we have demonstrated that phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) from Bacillus cereus is a prolyl peptidase using in vivo experiments. In the current work, we first report the inhibition of the native activity of PI-PLC by two DPP4 inhibitors - vildagliptin (LAF-237) and K-579. While vildagliptin inhibited PI-PLC at micromolar concentrations, K-579 was a potent inhibitor even at nanomolar concentrations. Subsequently, we queried a comprehensive, non-redundant set of 5000 human proteins (50% similarity cutoff) with known structures using serine protease (SPASE) motifs derived from trypsin and DPP4. A pancreatic lipase and a gastric lipase are among the proteins that are identified as proteins having promiscuous SPASE scaffolds that could interact with DPP4 inhibitors. The presence of such scaffolds in human lipases is expected since they share the same catalytic mechanism with PI-PLC. However our methodology also detects other proteins, often with a completely different enzymatic mechanism, that have significantly congruent domains with the SPASE motifs. The reported elevated levels of serum lipase, although contested, could be rationalized by inhibition of lipases reported here.\xa0In an effort to further our understanding of the spatial and electrostatic basis of DPP4 inhibitors, we have also done a comprehensive analysis of all 76 known DPP4 structures liganded to inhibitors till date.

It has been estimated that diabetes mellitus type 2 affects about 246 million people in the world; nevertheless, incidence varies among countries. There is evidence that depression is associated with a poor metabolic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus that present other health problems (such as hypertension and obesity). The aim of this study protocol is to determine if obesity increases the risk for depression in patient with diabetes type 2.Methods: The analysis will be reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA).The studies suitable for inclusion will be assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) to determine their methodological quality. To identify the studies of interest, we will search on PubMed and EBSCO databases.

[u'Does apical membrane GLUT2 have a role in intestinal glucose uptake?', ['Richard J. Naftalin'], u'12 Dec 2014', u'It has been proposed that the non-saturable component of intestinal glucose absorption, apparent following prolonged exposure to high intraluminal glucose concentrations, is mediated via the low affinity glucose and fructose transporter, GLUT2, upregulated within the small intestinal apical border.The evidence that the non-saturable transport component is mediated via an apical membrane sugar transporter is that it is inhibited by phloretin, after exposure to phloridzin. Since the other apical membrane sugar transporter, GLUT5, is insensitive to inhibition by either cytochalasin B, or phloretin, GLUT2 was deduced to be the low affinity sugar transport route.As in its uninhibited state, polarized intestinal glucose absorption depends both on coupled entry of glucose and sodium across the brush border membrane and on the enterocyte cytosolic glucose concentration exceeding that in both luminal and submucosal interstitial fluids, upregulation of GLUT2 within the intestinal brush border will usually stimulate downhill glucose reflux to the intestinal lumen from the enterocytes; thereby reducing, rather than enhancing net glucose absorption across the luminal surface.These states are simulated with a computer model generating solutions to the differential equations for glucose, Na and water flows between luminal, cell, interstitial and capillary compartments. The model demonstrates that uphill glucose transport via SGLT1 into enterocytes, when short-circuited by any passive glucose carrier in the apical membrane, such as GLUT2, will reduce transcellular glucose absorption and thereby lead to increased paracellular flow. The model also illustrates that apical GLUT2 may usefully act as an osmoregulator to prevent excessive enterocyte volume change with altered luminal glucose concentrations.', u'/articles/3-304/v1', ['Endocrinology & Gastroenterology', 'Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u"Department of Physiology and BHF Centre of Research Excellence, King's College London, School of Medicine, London, SE1 9HN, UK"]]

[u'A review of creatine supplementation in age-related diseases: more than a supplement for athletes', ['Rachel N. Smith', 'Amruta S. Agharkar', 'Eric B.

This dietary supplement can be acquired from food sources such as meat and fish, along with athlete supplement powders. Since the majority of creatine is stored in skeletal muscle, dietary creatine supplementation has traditionally been important for athletes and bodybuilders to increase the power, strength, and mass of the skeletal muscle. However, new uses for creatine have emerged suggesting that it may be important in preventing or delaying the onset of neurodegenerative diseases associated with aging. On average, 30% of muscle mass is lost by age 80, while muscular weakness remains a vital cause for loss of independence in the elderly population. In light of these new roles of creatine, the dietary supplement\u2019s usage has been studied to determine its efficacy in treating congestive heart failure, gyrate atrophy, insulin insensitivity, cancer, and high cholesterol. In relation to the brain, creatine has been shown to have antioxidant properties, reduce mental fatigue, protect the brain from neurotoxicity, and improve facets/components of neurological disorders like depression and bipolar disorder. The combination of these benefits has made creatine a leading candidate in the fight against age-related diseases, such as Parkinson\u2019s disease, Huntington\u2019s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, long-term memory impairments associated with the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and stroke.

[u'Vitamin D as a regulator of steroidogenic enzymes', ['Johan Lundqvist'], u'08 Jul 2014', u'During the last decades, the outlook on vitamin D has widened, from being a vitamin solely involved in bone metabolism and calcium homeostasis, to being a multifunctional hormone known to affect a broad range of physiological processes. The aim of this review is to summarize the research on vitamin D as a regulator of steroidogenic enzymes. Steroid hormones exert a wide range of physiological responses, including functions in the immune system, protein and carbohydrate metabolism, water and salt balance, reproductive system and development of sexual characteristics. The balance of sex hormones is also of importance in the context of breast and prostate cancer. Steroid hormones are synthesized in steroidogenic tissues such as the adrenal cortex, breast, ovaries, prostate and testis, either from cholesterol or from steroidogenic precursors secreted from other steroidogenic tissues. The hormonally active form of vitamin D has been reported to act as a regulator of a number of enzymes involved in the regulation of steroid hormon production, and thereby the production of both adrenal steroid hormones and sex hormones. The research reviewed in the article has in large part been performed in cell culture based experiments and laboratory animal experiments, and the physiological role of the vitamin D mediated regulation of steroidogenic enzyme need to be further investigated.', u'/articles/3-155/v1', ['Endocrinology & Gastroenterology', 'Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery', 'Urology, Gynecology & Obstetrics'], [u'Department of Biomedical Sciences and Veterinary Public Health, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Box 7028, SE-750 07 Uppsala, Sweden']]

Several factors may influence PDR\xa0including time of procedure and order of colonoscopy within a session. Our unit provides\xa0evening colonoscopy lists (6-9 pm). We examined whether colonoscopy performance declines in the evening.Design: Data for all National Health Service (NHS) outpatient colonoscopies performed at Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital in 2011 were examined. Timing, demographics, indication and colonoscopy findings were recorded. Statistical analysis was performed using multivariate regression.Results: Data from 2576 colonoscopies were included: 1163 (45.1%) in the morning, 1123 (43.6%) in the afternoon and 290 (11.3%) in the evening.\xa0 Overall PDR was 40.80%.

Low responder patients produce few oocytes and embryos, which significantly reduces their chances for success in a preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) cycle. Accumulation of vitrified oocytes or embryos before the actual PGD cycle is a possible strategy that might increase patient\u2019s chances for a healthy pregnancy.Aim of the study: This retrospective study evaluates the efficacy of a PGD program in low responder patients after repeated ovarian stimulation cycles with cumulative vitrification of oocytes and embryos.Methods: Over a period of 30 months, 13 patients entering the PGD program were identified as poor responders after their first ovarian stimulation. These patients started a PGD cycle for one of the following indications: history of recurrent implantation failure (n=1), cystic fibrosis (n=1), X-linked microtubular myopathy (n=1), recurrent miscarriages (n=5), Duchene muscular dystrophy (n=1), chromosomal translocation (n=1) and high sperm aneuploidy (n=1). \xa0After multiple ovarian hormonal stimulations patients had either all mature oocytes (Group A; 3 patients) or all of their day 2 embryos vitrified (group B; 10 patients).

[u'The parietal cell gastric H, K-ATPase also functions as the Na, K-ATPase and Ca-ATPase in altered states', ['Tushar Ray'], u'12 Sep 2013', u'This article offers an explanation for the apparent lack of Na, K-ATPase activity in parietal cells although ouabain has been known to inhibit gastric acid secretion since 1962. The gastric H, K-ATPase (proton-pump) seems to be acting in altered states, thus behaving like a Na, K-ATPase (Na-pump) and/or Ca-ATPase (Ca-pump) depending on cellular needs.\xa0 This conclusion is based on the following findings. First, parietal cell fractions do not exhibit Na, K-ATPase activity at pH 7.0 but do at pH 8.5. Second, the apical plasma membrane (APM) fraction exhibits a (Ca or Mg)-ATPase activity with negligible H, K-ATPase activity. However, when assayed with Mg alone in presence of the 80 k Da cytosolic proton-pump activator (HAF), the APM fraction reveals remarkably high H, K-ATPase activity, suggesting the observed low affinity of Ca (or Mg)-ATPase is an altered state of the latter. Third, calcium (between 1 and 4 \xb5M) shows both stimulation and inhibition of the HAF-stimulated H, K-ATPase depending on its concentration, revealing a close interaction between the\xa0 proton-pump activator and local Ca concentration in gastric H, K-ATPase function. Such interactions suggest that Ca is acting as a terminal member of the intracellular signaling system for the HAF-regulated proton-pump. It appears that during resting state, the HAF-associated H, K-ATPase remains inhibited by Ca (>1 \xb5M) and, prior to resumption of acid secretion the gastric H, K-ATPase acts temporarily as a Ca-pump for removing excess Ca from its immediate environment. This conclusion is consistent with the recent reports of immunochemical co-localization of the gastric H, K-ATPase and Ca-ATPase by superimposition in parietal cells, and a transitory efflux of Ca immediately preceding the onset of acid secretion. These new perspectives on proton-pump function would open new avenues for a fuller understanding of the intracellular regulation of the ubiquitous Na-pump.', u'/articles/2-165/v2', ['Endocrinology & Gastroenterology', 'Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'Ramakrishna Vedanta Ashrama of Phoenix, Tempe, AZ 85281, USA', u'SUNY Upstate Medical Center, Syracuse, NY 13210, USA']]

Some inherited metabolic diseases can be easily screened using biochemical assays, however many can only be accurately diagnosed by DNA sequencing. Fluorescent capillary Sanger sequencing (FS) is the gold standard method used by clinical laboratories for genetic diagnosis of many inherited conditions; however, it does have limitations. Recently microarray resequencing (MR) has been introduced into research and clinical practice as an alternative method for genetic diagnosis of heterogeneous conditions. In this report we compared the accuracy of mutation detection for MR with FS in a group of patients with \u2018low-normal\u2019 gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (gGT) cholestasis without known molecular diagnoses.Methods: 29 patient DNA samples were tested for mutations in the ATP8B1 and ABCB11 genes using both FS and MR.

In 3/29 samples FS and MR gave discordant results: MR had a false positive rate of 3.4% and a false negative rate of 7%.Conclusions: The major advantage of MR over FS is that multiple genes can be screened in one experiment, allowing rapid and cost-effective diagnoses.\xa0 However, we have demonstrated that MR technology is limited in sensitivity.

[u'Glycine-extended gastrin enhances somatostatin release from cultured rabbit fundic D-cells', ['Ian LP Beales'], u'20 Feb 2013', u'The role of the peptide hormone gastrin in stimulating gastric acid secretion is well established. Mature amidated gastrin is processed from larger peptide precursor forms. Increasingly these processing intermediates, such as glycine-extended gastrin (G-Gly) and progastrin, have been shown to have biological activities of their own, often separate and complementary to gastrin. Although G-Gly is synthesized and secreted by gastric antral G-cells, the physiological functions of this putative mediator are unclear. Gastrin and cholecystokinin (CCK) stimulate the secretion of somatostatin from gastric D-cells as part of the feedback control of gastric acid. In this study the effect of G-Gly and gastrin on the release of somatostatin from rabbit fundic D-cells was examined. D-cells were obtained by collagenase-EDTA digestion and elutriation and cultured for 48 hours. With a 2 hour exposure to the peptides, gastrin but not G-Gly stimulated somatostatin release. Treatment of D-cells for 24 hours with gastrin or G-Gly individually, significantly enhanced subsequent basal as well as CCK- and GLP-1-stimulated somatostatin release.

When fluorescently tagged trypanosomes were co-cultured, a small proportion of double-positive cells were observed. The formation of double-positive cells was dependent on the presence of extracellular calcium and was enhanced by placing cells in medium supplemented with fresh bovine serum. Time-lapse microscopy revealed that double-positive cells arose by bidirectional protein exchange in the absence of nuclear transfer.\xa0 Furthermore, super-resolution microscopy showed that this process occurred in \u22641 minute, the limit of temporal resolution in these experiments. Both cytoplasmic and membrane proteins could be transferred provided they gained access to the flagellum. Intriguingly, a component of the RNAi machinery (Argonaute) was able to move between cells, raising the possibility that small interfering RNAs are transported as cargo. Transmission electron microscopy showed that shared flagella contained two axonemes and two paraflagellar rods bounded by a single membrane. In some cases flagellar fusion was partial and interactions between cells were transient. In other cases fusion occurred along the entire length of the flagellum, was stable for several hours and might be irreversible. Fusion did not appear to be deleterious for cell function: paired cells were motile and could give rise to progeny while fused.

Here I propose a framework by which conspicuous colours can emerge when the selective pressures for camouflage are relaxed (1) because camouflage is not essential under specific prey/predator conditions or (2) due to the impossibility of reducing the signal-to-background noise in the environment. The first case is found among non-predator-species that possess effective defences against predators (hence a \u201cCarefree World\u201d), such as the strong macaws\u2019 beaks and the flight abilities of hummingbirds. The second case is found in diurnal mobile fish of coral reef communities, which swim in clear waters against highly contrasting and unpredictable (hence an "Hyper-Visible World\u201d). In those contexts the selective pressures that usually come secondary to camouflage (such as sexual, warning, species recognition or territorial display) are free to drive the evolution of brilliant and diverse colouration.

Stability of the brain\u2019s internal environment, particularly with respect to its ionic composition, is a prerequisite for the fundamental basis of its function, namely transmission of nerve impulses. In addition, the appropriate and controlled supply of a wide range of nutrients such as glucose, amino acids, monocarboxylates, and vitamins is also essential for normal development and function. These are all cellular functions across the interfaces that separate the brain from the rest of the internal environment of the body. An essential morphological component of all but one of the barriers is the presence of specialized intercellular tight junctions between the cells comprising the interface: endothelial cells in the blood-brain barrier itself, cells of the arachnoid membrane, choroid plexus epithelial cells, and tanycytes (specialized glial cells) in the circumventricular organs. In the ependyma lining the cerebral ventricles in the adult brain, the cells are joined by gap junctions, which are not restrictive for intercellular movement of molecules. But in the developing brain, the forerunners of these cells form the neuroepithelium, which restricts exchange of all but the smallest molecules between cerebrospinal fluid and brain interstitial fluid because of the presence of strap junctions between the cells. The intercellular junctions in all these interfaces are the physical basis for their barrier properties. In the blood-brain barrier proper, this is combined with a paucity of vesicular transport that is a characteristic of other vascular beds. Without such a diffusional restrain, the cellular transport mechanisms in the barrier interfaces would be ineffective. Superimposed on these physical structures are physiological mechanisms as the cells of the interfaces contain various metabolic transporters and efflux pumps, often ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, that provide an important component of the barrier functions by either preventing entry of or expelling numerous molecules including toxins, drugs, and other xenobiotics.In this review, we summarize these influx and efflux mechanisms in normal developing and adult brain, as well as indicating their likely involvement in a wide range of neuropathologies.There have been extensive attempts to overcome the barrier mechanisms that prevent the entry of many drugs of therapeutic potential into the brain. We outline those that have been tried and discuss why they may so far have been largely unsuccessful. Currently, a promising approach appears to be focal, reversible disruption of the blood-brain barrier using focused ultrasound, but more work is required to evaluate the method before it can be tried in patients. Overall, our view is that much more fundamental knowledge of barrier mechanisms and development of new experimental methods will be required before drug targeting to the brain is likely to be a successful endeavor.

These include the complete set of small molecule ligand-binding pockets and most protein-protein interfaces. ART structures are predicted to be capable of weakly binding metabolites and cover a significant fraction of metabolic pathways, with the most enriched pathways including ancient ones such as glycolysis.

In particular, the everted telencephalon of ray-finned fishes has a markedly different morphology compared to the evaginated telencephalon of all other vertebrates. This difference in development has hampered the comparison between different areas of the pallium of ray-finned fishes and the pallial nuclei of all other vertebrates. Various models of homology between pallial subdivisions in ray-finned fishes and the pallial nuclei in tetrapods have been proposed based on connectional, neurochemical, gene expression and functional data. However, no consensus has been reached so far. In recent years, the analysis of conserved developmental marker genes has assisted the identification of homologies for different parts of the telencephalon among several tetrapod species.Results: We have investigated the gene expression pattern of conserved marker genes in the adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) pallium to identify pallial subdivisions and their homology to pallial nuclei in tetrapods. Combinatorial expression analysis of ascl1a, eomesa, emx1, emx2, emx3, and Prox1 identifies four main divisions in the adult zebrafish pallium. Within these subdivisions, we propose that Dm is homologous to the pallial amygdala in tetrapods and that the dorsal subdivision of Dl is homologous to part of the hippocampal formation in mouse. We have complemented this analysis be examining the gene expression of emx1, emx2 and emx3 in the zebrafish larval brain.Conclusions: Based on our gene expression data, we propose a new model of subdivisions in the adult zebrafish pallium and their putative homologies to pallial nuclei in tetrapods. Pallial nuclei control sensory, motor, and cognitive functions, like memory, learning and emotion. The identification of pallial subdivisions in the adult zebrafish and their homologies to pallial nuclei in tetrapods will contribute to the use of the zebrafish system as a model for neurobiological research and human neurodegenerative diseases.', u'/articles/3-308/v2', ['Development & Evolution', 'Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry', 'Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology'], [u'Biotechnology Center, and DFG-Research Center for Regenerative Therapies Dresden, Technische Universit\xe4t Dresden, Dresden, 01307, Germany', u'Institute of Neuroscience, University of Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403, USA', u'Present address: Faculty of Medicine, Nursing Health Sciences Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, 3800, Australia']]

The aim of this retrospective cohort study is to determine predictive factors for psychiatric rehospitalization within 2 years among elderly patients who were discharged from psychiatric wards, in attempt to reduce their rehospitalization rate and to reintegrate them into the community. Patients aged 65 and over, who were discharged from psychiatric wards of Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital from 1 March 2010 to 29 February 2012, were identified. Rehospitalization within 2 years after discharge was the primary outcome measure, and the time to rehospitalization was measured as the secondary outcome. Patients were subgrouped into readmitted and non-readmitted groups. Logistic regression and Cox regression analyses were applied to the potential predictive factors with odds ratios and hazard ratios obtained, respectively, for the significant findings. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted for graphical representation of the study results in survival analysis. 368 individuals satisfying the study criteria were identified. The same four factors were shown to be significantly associated with rehospitalization in both multiple logistic regression and Cox regression survival analysis. Referral to other psychiatric disciplines upon discharge (p< 0.001, OR=0.325, HR=0.405) was associated with a lower rehospitalization risk and correlated to a longer time to rehospitalization.

A recent study shows that CNAs can freely enter into healthy cells, integrate into their genomes by a unique mechanism and cause damage to their DNA. Being ubiquitous and continuously arising, CNA-induced DNA damage may be the underlying cause of ageing, ageing-related disabilities and the ultimate demise of the organism. Thus, DNA seems to act in the paradoxical roles of both preserver and destroyer of life.

Therefore it\u2019s important to consider an eventual organic etiology while challenging a resistant clinical picture with unusual presentation.Case description: A 51-year-old woman reported neurological symptoms consisting of headaches, blurred vision, diplopia, tinnitus, vertigo and psychiatric symptoms including obsessive ideas about the fear of killing her son, auditory and visual pseudo-hallucinations.

These neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) are the source of new axial structures during embryonic rostrocaudal axis elongation and are marked by the simultaneous co-expression of the transcription factors T(Brachyury) (T(Bra)) and Sox2. NMP-like cells have recently been derived from pluripotent stem cells in vitro following combined stimulation of Wnt and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling. Under these conditions the majority of cultures consist of T(Bra)/Sox2 co-expressing cells after 48-72 hours of differentiation. Although the capacity of these cells to generate posterior neural and paraxial mesoderm derivatives has been demonstrated at the population level, it is unknown whether a single in vitro-derived NMP can give rise to both neural and mesodermal cells. Here we demonstrate that T(Bra) positive cells obtained from mouse epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) after culture in NMP-inducing conditions can generate both neural and mesodermal clones.

A recent development in Drosophila stem cell research is bringing wider opportunities for contemporary stem cell biologists. In this regard, Drosophila germ cells are becoming a popular model of stem cell research. In several cases, genes that controlled Drosophila stem cells were later discovered to have functional homologs in mammalian stem cells. Like mammals, Drosophila germline stem cells (GSCs) are controlled by both intrinsic as well as external signals. Inside the Drosophila testes, germline and somatic stem cells form a cluster of cells (the hub). Hub cells depend on JAK-STAT signaling, and, in absence of this signal, they do not self-renew. In Drosophila, significant changes occur within the stem cell niche that contributes to a decline in stem cell number over time. In case of aging Drosophila, somatic niche cells show reduced DE-cadherin and unpaired (Upd) proteins. Unpaired proteins are known to directly decrease stem cell number within the niches, and, overexpression of upd within niche cells restored GSCs in older males also\xa0. Stem cells in the midgut of Drosophila are also very promising. Reduced Notch signaling was found to increase the number of midgut progenitor cells.

[u'An explanatory evo-devo model for the developmental hourglass', ['Saamer Akhshabi', 'Shrutii Sarda', 'Constantine Dovrolis', 'Soojin Yi'], u'18 Dec 2014', u'The "developmental hourglass\'\' describes a pattern of increasing morphological divergence towards earlier and later embryonic development, separated by a period of significant conservation across distant species (the "phylotypic stage\'\'). Recent studies have found evidence in support of the hourglass effect at the genomic level. For instance, the phylotypic stage expresses the oldest and most conserved transcriptomes. However, the regulatory mechanism that causes the hourglass pattern remains an open question. Here, we use an evolutionary model of regulatory gene interactions during development to identify the conditions under which the hourglass effect can emerge in a general setting. The model focuses on the hierarchical gene regulatory network that controls the developmental process, and on the evolution of a population under random perturbations in the structure of that network. The model predicts, under fairly general assumptions, the emergence of an hourglass pattern in the structure of a temporal representation of the underlying gene regulatory network. The evolutionary age of the corresponding genes also follows an hourglass pattern, with the oldest genes concentrated at the hourglass waist. The key behind the hourglass effect is that developmental regulators should have an increasingly specific function as development progresses.

Most studies evaluate neurons molecularly and only a handful of them use electrophysiological tools to directly indicate that these are genuine neurons. Therefore, the specific timing of development of intrinsic electrophysiological properties and synaptic capabilities remains poorly understood. Here we describe a systematic analysis of developing neurons derived in-vitro from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). We show that hESCs differentiated in-vitro into early embryonic neurons, displaying basically mature morphological and electrical features as early as day 37. This early onset of action potential discharges suggests that first stages of neurogenesis in humans are already associated with electrical maturation. Spike frequency, amplitude, duration, threshold and after hyperpolarization were found to be the most predictive parameters for electrical maturity. Furthermore, we were able to detect spontaneous synaptic activity already at these early time-points, demonstrating that neuronal connectivity can develop concomitantly with the gradual process of electrical maturation.

PA1 is colonized by cranial neural crest cells (CNCCs) which give rise to most bones and tendons of the jaws. The elements formed by different CNCCs contingents are specified by the combinatorial expression of Dlx genes. Dlx5 and Dlx6 are predominantly expressed by mandibular CNCCs. Analysis of the phenotype of Dlx5 and Dlx6 double mutant mice has suggested that they are necessary and sufficient to specify mandibular identity. Here, using 3D reconstruction, we show that inactivation of Dlx5 and Dlx6 does not only affect the mandibular arch, but results in the simultaneous transformation of mandibular and maxillary skeletal elements which assume a similar morphology with gain of symmetry. As Dlx5- and Dlx6-expressing cells are not found in the maxillary bud, we have examined the lineage of Dlx5-expressing progenitors using an in vivo genetic approach. We find that a contingent of cells deriving from epithelial precursors transiently expressing Dlx5 participate in the formation of the maxillary arch. These cells are mostly located in the distal part of the maxillary arch and might derive from its lambdoidal junction with the olfactory pit. Our observations provide the first genetic demonstration of the \u2018Hinge and Caps\u2019 model[1].

[u'Vitellogenin family gene expression does not increase Drosophila lifespan or fecundity', ['Yingxue Ren', 'Kimberly A.

This pattern is consistent with the idea that organisms need to allocate a fixed energy budget among competing demands of growth, development, reproduction and somatic maintenance. However, exceptions to this pattern have been observed in many social insects, including ants, bees, and termites.\xa0 In honey bees (Apis mellifera), Vitellogenin (Vg), a yolk protein precursor, has been implicated in mediating the long lifespan and high fecundity of queen bees. To determine if Vg-like proteins can regulate lifespan in insects generally, we examined the effects of expression of Apis Vg and Drosophila CG31150 (a Vg-like gene recently identified as cv-d) on Drosophila melanogaster lifespan and fecundity using the RU486-inducible GeneSwitch system. For all genotypes tested, overexpression of Vg and CG31150 decreased Drosophila lifespan and did not affect total or age-specific fecundity. We also detected an apparent effect of the GeneSwitch system itself, wherein RU486 exposure (or the GAL4 expression it induces) led to a significant increase in longevity and decrease in fecundity in our fly strains. This result is consistent with the pattern reported in a recent meta-analysis of Drosophila aging studies, where transgenic constructs of the UAS/GAL4 expression system that should have no effect (e.g. an uninduced GeneSwitch) significantly extended lifespan in some genetic backgrounds.

[u'Evolution of alarm cues: a test of the kin selection hypothesis', ['Denis Meuthen', 'Sebastian A Baldauf', 'Timo Thunken'], u'27 May 2014', u'The evolution of alarm signals has puzzled evolutionary ecologists for decades. This is particularly true for alarm cues (\u2018Schreckstoff\u2019) which are present in many fishes. They are passively released through injuries and signal the presence of a predator. Although the benefits for conspecific receivers are obvious (they can adjust their behavior to avoid predation), those for the senders are not which is, however, a necessary requirement for the evolution of alarm signals. Several hypotheses relying on potential direct benefits for the senders have been suggested. Alarm cues might attract secondary predators which in turn might increase the escape probability of the sender. A primary immune enhancing role was suggested as well. An alternative explanation is based on Hamilton\u2019s inclusive fitness theory stating that individuals can indirectly increase their fitness by increasing the survival of genetically related individuals (\u2018kin selection theory\u2019). If related individuals preferentially benefit from alarm signals, for instance by being more receptive to kin-alarm cues, senders could increase their inclusive fitness. Here, we investigate whether individuals of the cichlid fish Pelvicachromis taeniatus\xa0respond differentially to alarm cues derived from kin and non-kin.\xa0P. taeniatus possesses alarm cues and is known to adjust its behavior when exposed to alarm cues. We measured the change in activity after the addition of alarm cues (derived from kin- and non-kin) relative to a control treatment. Reduced activity is a widespread behavioral adaptation to reduce predation risk in prey organisms. Fish of the alarm cue treatments significantly reduced their activity relative to control fish. However, fish did not respond differentially to alarm cues derived from kin and non-kin suggesting that potential inclusive fitness benefits are not mediated by responses specific to individual alarm cues.

Multiple mating and male mate choice copying, especially in internally fertilizing species, set the stage for increased sperm competition, i.e., sperm of two or more males can compete for fertilization of the female\u2019s ova. In the internally fertilizing fish Poecilia mexicana, males respond to the presence of rivals with reduced expression of mating preferences (audience effect), thereby lowering the risk of by-standing rivals copying their mate choice. Also, males interact initially more with a non-preferred female when observed by a rival, which has been interpreted in previous studies as a strategy to mislead rivals, again reducing sperm competition risk (SCR). Nevertheless, species might differ consistently in their expression of aggressive and reproductive behaviors, possibly due to varying levels of SCR. In the current study, we present a unique data set comprising ten poeciliid species (in two cases including multiple populations) and ask whether species can be characterized through consistent differences in the expression of aggression, sexual activity and changes in mate choice under increased SCR. We found consistent species-specific differences in aggressive behavior, sexual activity as well as in the level of misleading behavior, while decreased preference expression under increased SCR was a general feature of all but one species examined. Furthermore, mean sexual activity correlated positively with the occurrence of potentially misleading behavior. An alternative explanation for audience effects would be that males attempt to avoid aggressive encounters, which would predict stronger audience effects in more aggressive species. We demonstrate a positive correlation between mean aggressiveness and sexual activity (suggesting a hormonal link as a mechanistic explanation), but did not detect a correlation between aggressiveness and audience effects.

In transfected cells, both protein isoforms are nuclear and colocalize with densely methylated heterochromatic foci. With a view to understanding the physiological contribution of each isoform, and their respective roles in the pathogenesis of Rett syndrome, we set out to generate isoform-specific anti-MeCP2 antibodies. To this end, we immunized rabbits against the peptides corresponding to the short amino-terminal portions that are different between the two isoforms. The polyclonal antibodies thus obtained specifically detected their respective isoforms of MeCP2 in Neuro2a (N2A) cells transfected to express either form. Both antisera showed comparable sensitivities when used for Western blot or immunofluorescence, and were highly specific for their respective isoform. When those antibodies were used on mouse tissues, specific signals were easily detected for Mecp2_e1, whilst Mecp2_e2 was very difficult to detect by Western blot, and even more so by immunofluorescence.

In addition to its antioxidant properties, ascorbic acid and its biosynthetic precursors fulfill a variety of other physiological and molecular functions. A mutation in the ascorbic acid biosynthesis gene VTC1, which encodes GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase, results in conditional root growth inhibition in the presence of ammonium. To isolate suppressors of vtc1-1, which is in the Arabidopsis Columbia-0 background, seeds of the mutant were subjected to ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis. A suppressor mutant of vtc1-1 2, svt2, with wild-type levels of ascorbic acid and root growth similar to the wild type in the presence of ammonium was isolated. Interestingly, svt2 has Arabidopsis Landsberg erecta features, although svt2 is delayed in flowering and has an enlarged morphology. Moreover, the svt2 genotype shares similarities with Ler polymorphism markers and sequences, despite the fact that the mutant derived from mutagenesis of Col-0 vtc1-1 seed. We provide evidence that svt2 is not an artifact of the experiment, a contamination of Ler seed, or a result of outcrossing of the svt2 mutant with Ler pollen. Instead, our results show that svt2 exhibits transgenerational genotypic and phenotypic instability, which is manifested in a fraction of svt2 progeny, producing revertants that have Col-like phenotypic and genotypic characteristics. Some of those Col-like revertants then revert back to svt2-like plants in the subsequent generation.

PNH results from expansion of a clone of hematopoietic cells that, as a consequence of an inactivating mutation of the X-linked gene PIG-A, are deficient in glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked proteins: since these include the surface membrane complement-regulatory proteins CD55 and CD59, the red cells arising from this clone are exquisitely sensitive to lysis by activated complement.

Controversies regarding conflicting findings were also addressed.Results: The main mechanism involved in anti-cancer activity is anti-angiogenesis through down-regulation of \xa0Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor (VEGFR) and Hypoxia Inducible factor-1 \u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1), inhibition of endothelial cell migration, up-regulation of endostatin and thrombospondin-1, but there are many other contributing mechanisms like apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, down-regulation of Nuclear Factor Kappa B (NF-kB) and Protein kinase B (Akt) and decrease of cellular energy by impairing mitochondrial function. Growth impairment is related to down-regulation of Phospho-Inositol 3 Kinase (PI3K)/Akt axis and down-regulation of the p38 map kinase (MAPK) cascade. A possible role should be assigned to FF stimulated over-expression of Tribbles Homolog-3 (TRIB3) which inhibits Akt phosphorylation. Important anti-cancer and anti-metastatic activities are due to down-regulation of MCP-1 (monocyte chemotactic protein-1), decreased Metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) production, weak down-regulation of adhesion molecules like E selectin, intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAM) and Vascular Endothelial Adhesion Molecules (VCAM), and decreased secretion of chemokines like Interleukin-6 (IL-6), and down-regulation of cyclin D-1. There is no direct link between FF activity in lipid metabolism and anticancer activity, except for the fact that many anticancer actions are dependent from PPAR\u03b1 agonism. FF exhibits also PPAR\u03b1 independent anti-cancer activities.Conclusions:\xa0There are strong evidences indicating that FF can disrupt growth-related activities in many different cancers, due to anti-angiogenesis and anti-inflammatory effects.

[u'Targeting metastatic breast cancer: problems and potential', ['Sarah Deasy', 'Karol Szczepanek', 'Kent Hunter'], u'04 Jun 2015', u'Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality of women in the United States. Since the majority of cancer deaths are due to metastases rather than the primary tumor, a better understanding of the biological mechanisms that lead to metastatic disease is critical to reduce breast cancer associated mortality. Current adjuvant therapies use the same broadly cytotoxic and targeted strategies against metastases as are used against the primary tumor. However, resistance to chemotherapy due to the cellular dormancy, high genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity between primary tumor and metastases as well as among individual metastases, and the limitations in detection of disseminated tumor cells and micrometastases significantly hinder the efficiency of currently available therapies. While it is crucial to directly address the issue of metastatic dormancy and evaluate for anti-metastatic therapy the relevance of molecular targets chosen based on primary tumor profiling, it is also imperative to address metastasis-specific mechanisms of growth and survival that are likely to be distinct from those of the primary tumor. We believe that a three-pronged approach to therapy will be necessary to deal with progressive disease: blocking of further dissemination after diagnosis; eradication of disseminated tumor cells and prevention of the dormant-to-proliferative switch of those remaining; and elimination of established metastatic tumors.

A classification of PIs based on anti-cancer mode of action was proposed. Controversies regarding nelfinavir mode of action were also addressed.Conclusions: The two main mechanisms involved in anti-cancer activity are endoplasmic reticulum stress-unfolded protein response pathway and Akt inhibition. However there are many other effects, partially dependent and independent of those mentioned, that may be useful in cancer treatment, including MMP-9 and MMP-2 inhibition, down-regulation of CDK-2, VEGF, bFGF, NF-kB, STAT-3, HIF-1 alfa, IGF, EGFR, survivin, BCRP, androgen receptor, proteasome, fatty acid synthase (FAS), decrease in cellular ATP concentration and upregulation of TRAIL receptor DR5, Bax, increased radiosensitivity, and autophagy. The end result of all these effects is slower growth, decreased angiogenesis, decreased invasion and increased apoptosis, which means reduced proliferation and increased cancer cells death.PIs may be classified according to their anticancer activity at clinically achievable doses, in AKT inhibitors, ER stressors and Akt inhibitors/ER stressors.Beyond the phase I trials that have been recently completed, adequately powered and well-designed clinical trials are needed in the various cancer type settings, and specific trials where NFV is tested in association with other known anti-cancer pharmaceuticals should be sought, in order to find an appropriate place for NFV in cancer treatment.The analysis of controversies on the molecular mechanisms of NFV hints to the possibility that NFV works in a different way in tumor cells and in hepatocytes and adipocytes.', u'/articles/4-9/v2', ['Oncology & Hematology', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'Centro de Diagnostico y Tratamiento de la Obra Social del Personal de la Alimentaci\xf3n, Talar de Pacheco, Buenos Aires, 1618, Argentina']]
[u'Case Report: Radical prostatectomy without prostate biopsy in PI-RADS 5 lesions on 3T multi-parametric MRI of the prostate gland', ['Andrew Keller', 'Boon Kua'], u'26 Feb 2015', u'Objective: Current practice mandates a prostate biopsy for histological confirmation of prostate cancer prior to a radical prostatectomy. Prostate biopsy, whether performed trans-rectally or trans-perineally, is an invasive procedure which typically involves an anaesthetic and has the risks of urosepsis, bleeding and haematoma. Post-biopsy inflammatory changes can also obliterate natural tissue planes thereby potentially compromising the quality of a nerve sparing procedure and increasing positive margin rates.3T-Multi-Parametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Prostate (3T mpMRI-P) is gaining increasing acceptance in the identification and localisation of prostate cancer. In experienced centres, the positive predictive value has been reported to be as high as 95%.Methods: Two patients with rising and elevated age- adjusted PSAs and palpable malignant prostate nodules on Digital Rectal Examination (DRE) underwent 3T mpMRI-P. Both patients had Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) 5 lesions in their peripheral zones corresponding to palpable nodules. Prostate biopsies were offered but declined by both patients. Both were satisfied that there was sufficient evidence on their PSA, DRE and 3T mpMRI-P for a diagnosis of prostate cancer without prostate biopsies and both elected to proceed to a Da Vinci Robotic Assisted Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy (RALRP).Results: Unilateral nerve sparing RALRPs were performed on both patients without complication. Histology demonstrated Gleason 4+4=8 and 4+3=7 prostate adenocarcinomas, with tumour volumes of 14.92cc and 4.5cc respectively.Conclusions: In appropriately counselled patients who have a high pre-test probability of prostate cancer (rising and elevated PSA, malignant nodule on DRE and a corresponding PI-RADS 5 lesion on 3T mpMRI-P), it may be appropriate to proceed to a radical prostatectomy without a tissue diagnosis if the patients have strong reservations about prostate biopsy.', u'/articles/4-54/v1', ['Oncology & Hematology', 'Urology, Gynecology & Obstetrics'], [u'Wesley Research Institute, Auchenflower, QLD 4066, Australia', u'Wesley Private Hospital, Auchenflower, QLD 4066, Australia']]

In this study, we determined the prevalence and prognostic significance of thrombocytosis (defined as platelet count in excess of 400 \xd7 103/\u03bcl) in patients with colorectal cancer. We performed a retrospective analysis of 310 consecutive patients diagnosed at our Institution between 2004 and 2013. The patients (48.7% male and 51.3% female) had a mean age of 69.9 years (+/- 12.7 years) at diagnosis. Thrombocytosis was found in a total of 25 patients, with a higher incidence in those with stage III and IV disease (14.4% of patients). Although the mean platelet count increased with the depth of tumor invasion (pT), its values remained within normal limits in the whole patient cohort. No patient with stage I cancer (n=57) had elevated platelet count at diagnosis. By contrast, five of the 78 patients (6.4%) with stage II cancer showed thrombocytosis, and four of these patients showed early recurrence and/or metastatic disease, resulting in shortened survival (they died within one year after surgery). The incidence of thrombocytosis increased to 12.2% and 20.6%, respectively, in patients with stage III and IV disease. The overall survival rate of patients with thrombocytosis was lower than those without thrombocytosis in the stage II and III disease groups, but this difference disappeared in patients with stage IV cancer who did poorly regardless of their platelet count. We concluded that thrombocytosis at diagnosis indicates adverse clinical outcome in colorectal cancer patients with stage II or III disease.

The latest world cancer statistics calculated by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) revealed that 1,677,000 women were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2012 and 577,000 died. The TNM classification of malignant tumor (TNM) is the most commonly used staging system for breast cancer. Breast cancer is a group of very heterogeneous diseases. The molecular subtype of breast cancer carries important predictive and prognostic values, and thus has been incorporated in the basic initial process of breast cancer assessment/diagnosis. Molecular subtypes of breast cancers are divided into human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive (HER2 +), hormone receptor positive (estrogen or progesterone +), both positive, and triple negative breast cancer. By virtue of early detection via mammogram, the majority of breast cancers in developed parts of world are diagnosed in the early stage of the disease. Early stage breast cancers can be completely resected by surgery. Over time however, the disease may come back even after complete resection, which has prompted the development of an adjuvant therapy. Surgery followed by adjuvant treatment has been the gold standard for breast cancer treatment for a long time.

Timely diagnosis and aggressive multimodal management improves patient outcome. We present our experience of diagnosis and management of a young patient with monophasic synovial sarcoma arising from pericardium.Case: A 27-year-old man presented with dyspnea and cough of three weeks duration. Examination revealed sinus tachycardia, distant heart sounds and elevated jugular venous pressure. Chest X-ray showed widened mediastinum. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) noted large pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology. Therapeutic pericardiocentesis yielded hemorrhagic fluid. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed persistent pericardial effusion and a left anterior mediastinal mass. Left anterior thoracotomy, pericardial window and left anterior mediastinotomy were done, revealing a well-encapsulated gelatinous tumor originating from the pericardium. Histology and immunohistochemical profile showed the tumor to be a monophasic synovial sarcoma. Fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) was positive for SS18 (SYT) gene rearrangement on chromosome 18q11, substantiating the diagnosis. Work-up for metastases was negative. Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy with high dose ifosfamide led to substantial reduction in the size of the tumor. The patient underwent surgical resection and external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) post surgery. He had symptom-free survival for 8 months prior to local recurrence. This was managed with left lung upper lobectomy and follow-up chemotherapy with docetaxel. The patient is currently stable with an acceptable functional status.Conclusion: In patients with pericardial effusions of unknown etiology, multiple modalities of cardiac imaging must be employed if there is suspicion of a pericardial mass. CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are useful to evaluate for pericardial thickening or masses in addition to TTE. Treatment of synovial sarcoma is not well established.

[u'Regulation of Cancerous inhibitor of PP2A (CIP2A) by small molecule inhibitor for c-Jun NH2-Terminal Kinases (JNKs), SP600125, in Human Fibrosarcoma (HT1080) cells', ['Anchit Khanna'], u'11 Dec 2013', u'Background: Protein phosphatase 2A inhibition is one of the pre-requisites for human cell transformation. Previously, we have identified an endogenous inhibitor of PP2A, CIP2A (Cancerous Inhibitor of Protein Phosphatase 2A) in human fibrosarcoma cells (HT1080) using tandem affinity purification. CIP2A over expression has been demonstrated in almost every tumour type studied so far. However, our understanding on the mechanisms regulating CIP2A expression in human cancers, especially in sarcomas, is still emerging.\xa0Methods: \xa0Human fibrosarcoma (HT1080) cells were treated with small molecule inhibitors against the three major signalling pathways, namely p38, MEK and JNK pathways to identify the pathway regulating CIP2A expression in the sarcoma cells. This was followed by verification of the results using small interfering RNAs (siRNA) for the kinases.\xa0Results: \xa0In line with previous observations, small molecule inhibitor for MEK pathway (PD98059) decreased CIP2A mRNA and protein expression. Interestingly, small molecule inhibitor for the JNK pathway, SP600125 decreased mRNA and protein levels of CIP2A oncoprotein with negligible effect of SB203580 (p38 kinase) inhibitor on CIP2A expression in HT1080 cells. However, siRNAs specific to either JNK1 or JNK2 kinases did not result in decrease in CIP2A expression. Contrarily, two different CIP2A siRNAs, which were used as positive controls, decreased JNK2 expression in HT1080 cells.\xa0Conclusion: Although it is well established that SP600125 inhibits JNK kinases, it has also been shown to inhibit a spectra of other kinases. SP600125 inhibits CIP2A protein expression both in time and concentration dependent manner. However, depletion of both JNK1 and JNK2 kinases using specific siRNAs fails to decrease CIP2A protein expression levels, thereby indicating the need to verify the results obtained by treatment with small molecular inhibitors of kinases by independent approaches like two different target specific siRNAs. Finally, fortuitously we identify JNK2 as a CIP2A downstream target in HT1080 cells.', u'/articles/2-174/v2', ['Oncology & Hematology', 'Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'Adult Cancer Program, Lowy Cancer Research Centre and Prince of Wales Hospital, UNSW Medicine, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia', u'Institute of Biomedical Technology and BioMediTech, University of Tampere and Tampere University Hospital, Tampere, Finland', u'3Tampere Graduate Program in Biomedicine and Biotechnology (TGPBB), University of Tampere, Tampere, Finland']]

Apart from involvement in a variety of biological processes, microRNAs were early recognized for their potential in disease diagnostics and therapeutics. Due to their stability, microRNAs could be used as biomarkers. Currently, there are microRNA panels helping physicians determining the origins of cancer in disseminated tumors.

The microbiopsy device is fabricated from three stacked medical grade stainless steel plates tapered to a point and contains a chamber within the centre plate to collect the skin sample. We observed that the application of this device resulted in a 0.21 \xb1 0.04 mm wide puncture site in volunteer skin using reflectance confocal microscopy.

The declining sperm quantity and quality has been associated with increased overt disorders of sexual development including hypospadias, undescended testes and type II testicular germ cell tumours (TGCTs). The increase in TGCTs cannot be accounted for by genetic changes in the population. Therefore exposure to environmental toxicants appears to be a major contributor to the aetiology of TGCTs and men with a genetic predisposition are particularly vulnerable. In particular, Type II TGCTs have been identified to arise from a precursor lesion Carcinoma in situ (CIS), identified as a dysfunctional gonocyte; however, the exact triggers for CIS development are currently unknown. Therefore the transition from gonocytes into spermatogonia is key to those studying TGCTs. Recently we have identified seven miRNA molecules (including members of the miR-290 family and miR-136, 463* and 743a) to be significantly changed over this transition period. These miRNA molecules are predicted to have targets within the CXCR4, PTEN, DHH, RAC and PDGF pathways, all of which have important roles in germ cell migration, proliferation and homing to the spermatogonial stem cell niche. Given the plethora of potential targets affected by each miRNA molecule, subtle changes in miRNA expression could have significant consequences e.g. tumourigenesis. The role of non-traditional oncogenes and tumour suppressors such as miRNA in TGCT is highlighted by the fact that the majority of these tumours express wild type p53, a pivotal tumour suppressor usually inactivated in cancer. While treatment of TGCTs is highly successful, the impact of these treatments on fertility means that identification of exact triggers, earlier diagnosis and alternate treatments are essential.

To study the effects of UVB radiation on DNA methylation, we repeatedly exposed normal human keratinocytes to a UVB light source. After a recovery period, we analyzed global DNA methylation patterns in the irradiated and control cells using the methylated-CpG island recovery assay (MIRA) method in combination with high-resolution microarrays. Bioinformatics analysis revealed only a limited number of possible differences between UVB-exposed and control cells. However, these minor apparent changes could not be independently confirmed by bisulfite sequencing-based approaches.

Harper'], u'05 Apr 2016', u'We present an approach to analyzing fMRI timetrends from volumes-of-interest (VOI) within and between subject groups using repeated measures analysis of variance (RMANOVA), which allows temporal patterns to be examined without an a priori model of expected timing or pattern of response. The method serves as a complement to whole-brain voxel-based analyses, and is useful for detecting complex responses within pre-determined brain regions, or as a post-hoc analysis of regions of interest identified by whole-brain assessments. We illustrate an implementation of the technique in the statistical software package SAS. VOI timetrends are extracted from conventionally preprocessed fMRI images. A timetrend of average signal intensity across the VOI during the scanning period is calculated for each subject. The values are scaled relative to baseline periods, imported into SAS, and the procedure PROC MIXED implements the RMANOVA. The ensuing results allow determination of significant overall effects, and time-point specific within- and between-group responses relative to baseline. We illustrate the technique using fMRI data from two groups of subjects who underwent a respiratory challenge. RMANOVA allows insight into the timing of responses and response differences between groups, and so is suited to fMRI paradigms eliciting complex response patterns.', u'/articles/5-563/v1', ['Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'UCLA School of Nursing, LA, CA, USA', u'Brain Research Institute, Department of Neurobiology, David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA, LA, CA, USA', u'School of Health Sciences, University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand', u'Department of Neurobiology, David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA, LA, CA, USA']]
[u'A protocol to examine vision and gait in Parkinson\u2019s disease: impact of cognition and response to visual cues', ['Samuel Stuart', 'Brook Galna', 'Sue Lord', 'Lynn Rochester'], u'24 Mar 2016', u'BackgroundCognitive and visual impairments are common in Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) and contribute to gait deficit and falls. To date, cognition and vision in gait in PD have been assessed separately. Impact of both functions (which we term \u2018visuo-cognition\u2019) on gait however is likely interactive and can be tested using visual sampling (specifically saccadic eye movements) to provide an online behavioural measure of performance. Although experiments using static paradigms show saccadic impairment in PD, few studies have quantified visual sampling during dynamic motor tasks such as gait.This article describes a protocol developed for testing visuo-cognition during gait in order to examine the: 1) independent roles of cognition and vision in gait in PD, 2) interaction between both functions, and 3) role of visuo-cognition in gait in PD.Methods Two groups of older adults (\u226550 years old) were recruited; non-demented people with PD (n=60) and age-matched controls (n=40). Participants attended one session and a sub-group (n=25) attended two further sessions in order to establish mobile eye-tracker reliability. Participants walked in a gait laboratory under different attentional (single and dual task), environmental (walk straight, through a door and turning), and cueing (no visual cues and visual cues) conditions. Visual sampling was recorded using synchronised mobile eye-tracker and electrooculography systems, and gait was measured using 3D motion analysis.Discussion This exploratory study examined visuo-cognitive processes and their impact on gait in PD. Improved understanding of the influence of cognitive and visual functions on visual sampling during gait and gait in PD will assist in development of interventions to improve gait and reduce falls risk. This study will also help establish robust mobile eye-tracking methods in older adults and people with PD.', u'/articles/4-1379/v2', ['Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry'], [u'Institute of Neuroscience/ Newcastle University Institute for Ageing, Clinical Ageing Research Unit, Newcastle University, Newcastle, NE1 7RU, UK']]

Futschik'], u'02 Mar 2016', u'Huntington \u0301s disease (HD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease with a fatal outcome. Although the disease-causing gene (huntingtin) has been known for over 20 years, the exact mechanisms leading to neuronal cell death are still controversial. One potential mechanism contributing to the massive loss of neurons observed in the brain of HD patients could be the unfolded protein response (UPR) activated by accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). As an adaptive response to counter-balance accumulation of un- or misfolded proteins, the UPR upregulates transcription of chaperones, temporarily attenuates new translation, and activates protein degradation via the proteasome. However, persistent ER stress and an activated UPR can also cause apoptotic cell death. Although different studies have indicated a role for the UPR in HD, the evidence remains inconclusive. Here, we present extensive bioinformatic analyses that revealed UPR activation in different experimental HD models based on transcriptomic data. Accordingly, we have identified 53 genes, including RAB5A, HMGB1, CTNNB1, DNM1, TUBB, TSG101, EEF2, DYNC1H1, SLC12A5, ATG5, AKT1, CASP7 and SYVN1 that provide a potential link between UPR and HD. To further elucidate the potential role of UPR as a disease-relevant process, we examined its connection to apoptosis based on molecular interaction data, and identified a set of 40 genes including ADD1, HSP90B1, IKBKB, IKBKG, RPS3A and LMNB1, which seem to be at the crossroads between these two important cellular processes. Remarkably, we also found strong correlation of UPR gene expression with the length of the polyglutamine tract of Huntingtin, which is a critical determinant of age of disease onset in human HD patients pointing to the UPR as a promising target for therapeutic intervention. The study is complemented by a newly developed web-portal called UPR-HD (http://uprhd.sysbiolab.eu) that enables visualization and interactive analysis of UPR-associated gene expression across various HD models.', u'/articles/4-103/v2', ['Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry'], [u'Centre for Biomedical Research, University of Algarve, Faro, 8005-139, Portugal', u'Centre of Marine Sciences, University of Algarve, Faro, 8005-139, Portugal']]
[u'Axonal maintenance, glia, exosomes, and heat shock proteins', ['Michael Tytell', 'Raymond J. Lasek', 'Harold Gainer'], u'22 Feb 2016', u'Of all cellular specializations, the axon is especially distinctive because it is a narrow cylinder of specialized cytoplasm called axoplasm with a length that may be orders of magnitude greater than the diameter of the cell body from which it originates. Thus, the volume of axoplasm can be much greater than the cytoplasm in the cell body. This fact raises a logistical problem with regard to axonal maintenance. Many of the components of axoplasm, such as soluble proteins and cytoskeleton, are slowly transported, taking weeks to months to travel the length of axons longer than a few millimeters after being synthesized in the cell body. Furthermore, this slow rate of supply suggests that the axon itself might not have the capacity to respond fast enough to compensate for damage to transported macromolecules. Such damage is likely in view of the mechanical fragility of an axon, especially those innervating the limbs, as rapid limb motion with high impact, like running, subjects the axons in the limbs to considerable mechanical force. Some researchers have suggested that local, intra-axonal protein synthesis is the answer to this problem. However, the translational state of axonal RNAs remains controversial. We suggest that glial cells, which envelop all axons, whether myelinated or not, are the local sources of replacement and repair macromolecules for long axons. The plausibility of this hypothesis is reinforced by reviewing several decades of work on glia-axon macromolecular transfer, together with recent investigations of exosomes and other extracellular vesicles, as vehicles for the transmission of membrane and cytoplasmic components from one cell to another.', u'/articles/5-205/v1', ['Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry', 'Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology'], [u'Department of Neurobiology and Anatomy, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, 27157, USA', u'Department of Anatomy, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH, 44106, USA', u'Laboratory of Neurochemistry, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, 20892, USA', u'Marine Biological Laboratory, Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, MA, 02543, USA']]

One such drug is natalizumab (Tysabri, Biogen Idec and Elan pharmaceuticals) which has enjoyed great success in the management of MS since its re-introduction in 2006. One of the complications of using natalizumab is the risk of development of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). To mitigate the risk of PML development, Biogen Idec initiated the TOUCH program \u2013 this strategy helps monitor the disease. Clinical vigilance remains key in the early diagnosis of PML but serological testing for the John Cunningham Virus Antibody (JCV) helps with risk stratification of PML. However, some physicians do not test for the JCV Ab and since they are not required to send such data to the company or inform the patient, one red flag for suspicion of PML is lost particularly if the patient is asymptomatic. \xa0This undercuts the premise of the TOUCH program. In an ideal world, reporting JCV Ab status should be made mandatory since that ensures a basic tenet of the program is met \u2013 to identify patients at increased risk of developing PML and make appropriate recommendations based on that finding. Lack of requirement of reporting of this vital finding opens the door for uncertainty in assessment of risk PML development and everyone remains in the dark till it may be too late.

Enhancing intracellular clearance of aggregation-prone proteins is a plausible strategy for slowing progression of neurodegenerative diseases and there is great interest in identifying molecular targets that control protein turnover. One of the main routes for protein degradation is through the proteasome, a multisubunit protease that degrades proteins that have been tagged with a polyubiquitin chain by ubiquitin activating and conjugating enzymes. Published data from cellular models indicate that Ubiquitin-specific protease 14 (USP14), a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB), slows the degradation of tau and TDP-43 by the proteasome and that an inhibitor of USP14 increases the degradation of these substrates.

When the models' three parameters were not constrained to mimic the monkeys' behavior, the model over-matched the reward proportions and in doing so, harvested substantially more reward than the monkeys. This optimized model revealed a marked bottleneck in the monkeys' choice function that compares the value of the two options. The model featured a very steep value comparison function relative to that of the monkeys. The steepness of the value comparison function had a profound effect on the earned reward and on the level of matching.\xa0We implemented this value comparison function through responses of simulated biological neurons.\xa0We found that due to the presence of neural noise, steepening the value comparison requires an exponential increase in the number of value-coding neurons.\xa0Matching may be a compromise between harvesting satisfactory reward and the high demands placed by neural noise on optimal neural computation.", u'/articles/4-147/v2', ['Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry'], [u'Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, 63110, USA', u'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO, 63130, USA']]

We report such an event after attempting ventricular puncture (ventriculostomy) for VP shunt insertion and then discuss the management of the same. Dry tap can lead to multiple attempts for ventriculostomy with the associated added risks of complications, as well as complicating the subsequent management. In addition, there is an increased risk of tension pneumocephalus, seizure and shunt failure due to a blockage by air bubbles. Our patient presented with features of raised intracranial pressure two months following craniotomy and evacuation of traumatic subdural hematoma. External ventricular puncture revealed egress of CSF under pressure. Upon attempting VP shunting for post-traumatic hydrocephalus, we experienced dry tap during ventricular puncture that complicated further management. We placed the proximal shunt in the presumed location of the foramen of Monro of ipsilateral frontal horn of lateral ventricle and did not remove the external ventricular drain. Post-operative CT scan revealed pneumoventriculi as the cause for the dry tap during ventricular puncture. Patient was managed with 100% oxygen. He showed gradual improvement and was later discharged. This case shows that variations in the procedure, including head down positioning, adequate cruciate dural incision prior to cortex puncture, and avoiding excessive egress of CSF can help to prevent such complications.', u'/articles/4-188/v2', ['Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry'], [u'Department of Neurosurgery, College of Medical Sciences, Bharatpur, 44207, Nepal']]

[u'Finding indexes of spontaneous brain-to-brain communications when looking for a cause of the similarity of qualia assumed across individuals', ['Sheila Bouten', 'Hugo Pantecouteau', 'J. Bruno Debruille'], u'27 Aug 2015', u'Qualia, the individual instances of subjective conscious experience, are private events. However, in everyday life, we assume qualia of others and their perceptual worlds, to be similar to ours. One way this similarity is possible is if qualia of others somehow contribute to the production of qualia by our own brain\xa0and vice versa. To test this hypothesis, we focused on the mean voltages of event-related potentials (ERPs) in the time-window of the P600 component, whose amplitude correlates positively with conscious awareness. These ERPs were elicited by stimuli of the international affective picture system in 16 pairs of friends, siblings or couples going side by side through hyperscanning without having to interact. Each of the 32 members of these 16 pairs faced one half of the screen and could not see what the other member was presented with on the other half. One stimulus occurred on each half simultaneously. The sameness of these stimulus pairs was manipulated as well as the participants\u2019 belief in that sameness by telling subjects\u2019 pairs that they were going to be presented with the same stimuli in two blocks and with different ones in the two others. In the P600 time window, belief, and thus social cognition, was found to have an effect on ERPs only at left anterior electrode sites. In contrast, ERPs were more positive at all electrode subsets for stimulus pairs that were\xa0\xa0 inconsistent with the belief than for those that were consistent. In the N400 time window, at frontal electrode sites, ERPs were again more positive for inconsistent than for consistent stimuli. As participants had no way to see the stimulus their partner was presented with, and thus no way to detect inconsistence, we proposed that these data could support the existence of spontaneous brain-to-brain communications.

These expenses are related to the lack of productivity of schizophrenic patients and the cost that relatives have to bear as a result of taking care of their affected relatives.Conclusions: Although data on the cost of schizophrenia may vary slightly between different european countries, the general conclusion that can be drawn is that schizophrenia is a very costly disorder.

However, many options cannot provide functionality such as visualizing activation clusters that are both cortical and subcortical (i.e., a 3D glass brain), the production of several statistical maps with an identical perspective in the 3D rendering, or animated renderings.

In this observational/case study, we investigated the association between neurocognitive function, assessed using a trail making test, and sensorimotor function, assessed using a visuomotor adaptation task, in three children who suffered from a concussion while playing sports. For the trail making test, children drew lines to connect numbers and letters alternately on a page. For the visuomotor adaptation task, children performed targeted reaching movements repeatedly under a novel visuomotor condition in which the visual display of reaching movements was rotated 30 degrees about the start position. Their neurocognitive and visuomotor performances were compared to those obtained from three children without a concussion. Results showed that only one of the three concussed children showed a score from the trail making test that was worse than the scores obtained from control subjects. However, the pattern of visuomotor adaptation observed in the concussed children was different from that observed in the control subjects in several ways.

In this study we analysed publically-available EEG data using a range of complexity measures to determine how well the measures correlated with one another. The complexity measures did not all significantly correlate, suggesting that different measures were measuring unique features of the EEG signals and thus revealing information which other measures were unable to detect. Therefore, the results from this analysis suggests that combinations of complexity measures reveal unique information which is in addition to the information captured by other measures of complexity in EEG data.

This study aimed to test whether pan-neural supplementation of the longevity-related, pleiotropic deacetylase SIRT1, which confers partial tolerance to at least three models of stroke and neurodegeneration, could also alleviate MPTP-induced acute pathological changes in nigrostriatal DA neurons and neighboring glia.ResultsWe employed a line of prion promoter-driven Sirt1-transgenic (Sirt1Tg) mice that chronically overexpress murine SIRT1 in the brain and spinal cord. Sirt1Tg and wild-type (WT) male littermates (3\u20124 months old) were subjected to intraperitoneal injection of MPTP. Acute histopathological changes in the midbrain and striatum (caudoputamen) were assessed with serial coronal sections triply labeled for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and nuclear DNA. In the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) of the midbrain, the number of TH-positive neurons and the reactive gliosis were comparable between the Sirt1Tg and WT littermates.

[u'A(a)LS: Ammonia-induced amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', ['Bhavin Parekh'], u'14 May 2015', u'Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a dreadful, devastating and incurable motor neuron disease. Aetiologically, it is a multigenic, multifactorial and multiorgan disease. Despite intense research, ALS pathology remains unexplained. Following extensive literature review, this paper posits a new integrative explanation. This framework proposes that ammonia neurotoxicity is a main player in ALS pathogenesis. According to this explanation, a combination of impaired ammonia removal\u2014 mainly because of impaired hepatic urea cycle dysfunction\u2014and increased ammoniagenesis\u2014 mainly because of impaired glycolytic metabolism in fast twitch skeletal muscle\u2014causes chronic hyperammonia in ALS. In the absence of neuroprotective calcium binding proteins (calbindin, calreticulin and parvalbumin), elevated ammonia\u2014a neurotoxin\u2014damages motor neurons. Ammonia-induced motor neuron damage occurs through multiple mechanisms such as macroautophagy-endolysosomal impairment, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, CDK5 activation, oxidative/nitrosative stress, neuronal hyperexcitability and neuroinflammation.

We hypothesized that exogenous levodopa might increase dopamine release at striatal synapses under some conditions but not others, allowing a more naturalistic assessment of presynaptic dopaminergic function. Presynaptic dopaminergic abnormalities have been reported in Tourette syndrome (TS).Objective: Test whether levodopa induces measurable synaptic DA release in healthy people at rest, and gather pilot data in TS.Methods: This double-blind crossover study used RAC* and positron emission tomography (PET) to measure synaptic dopamine release 4 times in each of 10 carbidopa-pretreated, neuroleptic-na\xefve adults: before and during an infusion of levodopa on one day and placebo on another (in random order). Five subjects had TS and 5 were matched controls. RAC* binding potential (BPND) was quantified in predefined anatomical volumes of interest (VOIs). A separate analysis compared BPND voxel by voxel over the entire brain.Results: DA release declined between the first and second scan of each day (p=0.012), including on the placebo day. Levodopa did not significantly reduce striatal RAC* binding and striatal binding did not differ significantly between TS and control groups. However, levodopa\u2019s effect on DA release differed significantly in a right midbrain region (p=0.002, corrected), where levodopa displaced RAC* by 59% in control subjects but increased BPND by 74% in TS subjects.Discussion: Decreased DA release on the second scan of the day is consistent with the few previous studies with a similar design, and may indicate habituation to study procedures. We hypothesize that mesostriatal DA neurons fire relatively little while subjects rest, possibly explaining the non-significant effect of levodopa on striatal RAC* binding.

The pervasiveness of such false memories generates a puzzle: in the face of selection pressure for accuracy of memory, how could such systematic failures have persisted over evolutionary time? It is possible that memory errors are an inevitable by-product of our adaptive memories and that semantic false memories are specifically connected to our ability to learn rules and concepts and to classify objects by category memberships. Here we test this possibility using a standard experimental false memory paradigm and inter-individual variation in verbal categorisation ability. Indeed it turns out that the error scores are significantly negatively correlated, with those individuals scoring fewer errors on the categorisation test being more susceptible to false memory intrusions in a free recall test.

Here we determined the NMR topology and dynamics of a helical mutant in a membrane environment transformed from the 125-residue cytosolic all-\u03b2 MSP domain of vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein B (VAPB) by the ALS-causing P56S mutation. Despite its low hydrophobicity, the P56S major sperm protein (MSP) domain becomes largely embedded in the membrane environment with high backbone rigidity. Furthermore it is composed of five helices with amphiphilicity comparable to those of the partly-soluble membrane toxin mellitin and \u03b1-synuclein causing Parkinson's disease. Consequently, the mechanism underlying this chameleon transformation becomes clear: by disrupting the specific tertiary interaction network stabilizing the native all-\u03b2 MSP fold to release previously-locked amphiphilic segments, the P56S mutation acts to convert the classic MSP fold into a membrane-active protein that is fundamentally indistinguishable from mellitin and \u03b1-synuclein which are disordered in aqueous solution but spontaneously partition into membrane interfaces driven by hydrogen-bond energetics gained from forming \u03b1-helix in the membrane environments. As segments with high amphiphilicity exist in all proteins, our study successfully resolves the paradox by deciphering that the proteins with a higher tendency to aggregate have a stronger potential to partition into membranes through the same mechanism as \u03b1-synuclein to initially attack membranes to trigger pathogenesis without needing aggregates. This might represent the common first step for various kinds of aggregated proteins to trigger familiar, sporadic and aging diseases. Therefore the homeostasis of aggregated proteins in vivo is the central factor responsible for a variety of human diseases including aging. The number and degree of the membrane attacks by aggregated proteins may act as an endogenous clock to count down the aging process. Consequently, a key approach to fight against them is to develop strategies and agents to maintain or even enhance the functions of the degradation machineries.", u'/articles/2-221/v2', ['Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry', 'Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'Department of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Science, National University of Singapore, Singapore, 119260, Singapore', u'NUS Graduate School for Integrative Sciences and Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore, 119260, Singapore']]

Tremor in the upper limbs causes functional disability and social inconvenience, impairing daily life activities. The response of tremor to pharmacotherapy is variable. Therefore, a combination of drugs is often required. Surgery is considered when the response to medications is not sufficient. However, about one third of patients are refractory to current treatments. New bioengineering therapies are emerging as possible alternatives. Our study was carried out in the framework of the European project \u201cTremor\u201d (ICT-2007-224051). The main purpose of this challenging project was to develop and validate a new treatment for upper limb tremor based on the combination of functional electrical stimulation (FES; which has been shown to reduce upper limb tremor) with a brain-computer interface (BCI). A BCI-driven detection of voluntary movement is used to trigger FES in a closed-loop approach. Neurological tremor is detected using a matrix of EMG electrodes and inertial sensors embedded in a wearable textile. The identification of the intentionality of movement is a critical aspect to optimize this complex system. We propose a multimodal detection of the intentionality of movement by fusing signals from EEG, EMG and kinematic sensors (gyroscopes and accelerometry). Parameters of prediction of movement are extracted in order to provide global prediction plots and trigger FES properly. In particular, quality parameters (QPs) for the EEG signals, corticomuscular coherence and event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) parameters are combined in an original algorithm which takes into account the refractoriness/responsiveness of tremor. A simulation study of the relationship between the threshold of ERD/ERS of artificial EEG traces and the QPs is also provided.

Indeed, in astrocytes but not in neurons, IGF-I decreases the pro-oxidant protein thioredoxin-interacting protein 1 and normalizes the levels of reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, IGF-I cooperates with trophic signals produced by astrocytes in response to H2O2 such as stem cell factor (SCF) to protect neurons against oxidative insult. After stroke, a condition associated with brain aging where oxidative injury affects peri-infarcted regions, a simultaneous increase in SCF and IGF-I expression was found in the cortex, suggesting that a similar cooperative response takes place in vivo.

Therefore, neuroimaging studies investigating PTSD typically include both patients with and without comorbid depression. Differences in activity of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and insula have been shown to differentiate PTSD patients with and without major depressive disorder (MDD). Whether or not comorbid MDD affects resting state functional connectivity of PTSD patients has not been investigated to our knowledge. Here, resting state functional connectivity of PTSD patients with (PTSD+MDD; n=27) and without (PTSD-MDD; n=23) comorbid MDD was investigated. The subgenual ACC and insula were investigated as seed regions. Connectivity between the subgenual ACC and perigenual parts of the ACC was increased in PTSD+MDD versus PTSD-MDD, which may reflect the presence of depressive specific symptoms such as rumination. Functional connectivity of the subgenual ACC with the thalamus was reduced, potentially related to more severe deficits in executive functioning in the PTSD+MDD group versus the PTSD-MDD group. In addition, the PTSD+MDD group showed reduced functional connectivity of the insula with the hippocampus compared to the PTSD-MDD group. However, this cluster was no longer significantly different when PTSD patients that were using medication were excluded from analyses. Thus, resting state functional connectivity of the subgenual ACC can distinguish PTSD+MDD from PTSD-MDD, and this may therefore be used as a neurobiological marker for comorbid MDD in the presence of PTSD. As PTSD+MDD are more treatment resistant, these findings can also guide treatment development, for example by targeting the subgenual ACC network with treatment.', u'/articles/2-289/v2', ['Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry'], [u'Research Centre-Military Mental Healthcare, Ministry of Defence, 3584 CX Utrecht, Netherlands', u'Brain Center Rudolph Magnus, University Medical Center Utrecht, 3584 CX Utrecht, Netherlands']]

Previous research has shown rTMS to be safe and without significant side effects compared to pharmacologic options. However, rare cases of rTMS-induced mania have been reported. This case report describes such an affective switch in a 52 year old female veteran with treatment-resistant MDD and a history of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)-induced mania. Six treatments of rTMS were administered at 5 Hz for a total of 3000 pulses per day, when the patient began to display multiple hypomanic symptoms.

[u'Does excitatory fronto-extracerebral tDCS lead to improved working memory performance?', ['Niall Lally', 'Camilla L. Nord', 'Vincent Walsh', 'Jonathan P. Roiser'], u'10 Dec 2013', u'Evidence suggests that excitatory transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) may improve performance on a wide variety of cognitive tasks. Due to the non-invasive and inexpensive nature of the method, harnessing its potential could be particularly useful for the treatment of neuropsychiatric illnesses involving cognitive dysfunction. However, questions remain regarding the efficacious stimulation parameters. Here, using a double-blind between-subjects design, we explored whether 1 mA excitatory (anodal) left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex stimulation with a contralateral extracerebral reference electrode, leads to enhanced working memory performance across two days, relative to sham stimulation. Participants performed the 3-back, a test of working memory, at baseline, and during and immediately following stimulation on two days, separated by 24-48 hours. Active stimulation did not significantly enhance performance versus sham over the course of the experiment. However, exploratory comparisons did reveal a significant effect of stimulation group on performance during the first stimulation phase only, with active stimulation recipients performing better than sham. While these results do not support the hypothesis that dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tDCS boosts working memory, they raise the possibility that its effects may be greatest during early learning stages.', u'/articles/2-219/v2', ['Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry'], [u'Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London, London, WC1N 3AR, UK']]
[u'A novel pseudoderivative-based mutation operator for real-coded adaptive genetic algorithms', ['Maxinder S Kanwal', 'Avinash S Ramesh', 'Lauren A Huang'], u'19 Nov 2013', u'Recent development of large databases, especially those in genetics and proteomics, is pushing the development of novel computational algorithms that implement rapid and accurate search strategies. One successful approach has been to use artificial intelligence and methods, including pattern recognition (e.g. neural networks) and optimization techniques (e.g. genetic algorithms). The focus of this paper is on optimizing the design of genetic algorithms by using an adaptive mutation rate that is derived from comparing the fitness values of successive generations. We propose a novel pseudoderivative-based mutation rate operator designed to allow a genetic algorithm to escape local optima and successfully continue to the global optimum. Once proven successful, this algorithm can be implemented to solve real problems in neurology and bioinformatics. As a first step towards this goal, we tested our algorithm on two 3-dimensional surfaces with multiple local optima, but only one global optimum, as well as on the N-queens problem, an applied problem in which the function that maps the curve is implicit. For all tests, the adaptive mutation rate allowed the genetic algorithm to find the global optimal solution, performing significantly better than other search methods, including genetic algorithms that implement fixed mutation rates.', u'/articles/2-139/v2', ['Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, Alexandria, VA 22312, USA']]
[u'Tissue-specific regulation of the Na, K-ATPase by the cytosolic NaAF: some thoughts on brain function', ['Tushar Ray'], u'13 Nov 2013', u'The dual topology P-2 ATPase, which consists of a \u03b1\xb2\u03b2\xb2 tetramer, explains numerous functions of the cation transporting ATPase system. The ubiquitous cytosolic protein regulator (NaAF) of 170 k Da mass regulates P-2 ATPase function in a low Ca (\xb5M) neighborhood where Ca acts as the terminal regulator in the intracellular signaling cascade. The Na, K- ATPase also seems to function as an H, K-ATPase or a Ca-ATPase in altered states based on the local environment (low pH or high Ca) in a tissue specific manner. These altered effects are analogous to that of the 80 k Da cytosolic HAF in regulating the gastric H, K-ATPase system of the parietal cells. \xa0However there are some important differences. The HAF stimulates the Na, K-ATPase but the NaAF cannot stimulate H, K-ATPase. Also, HAF is as effective as NaAF in stimulating the kidney Na, K-ATPase but about 60% as effective in stimulating brain Na, K-ATPase. These observations reveal that the Na, K- ATPase systems from kidney and brain, consisting of different kinds of \u03b1\u03b2\u2013isoforms, interact differently with the HAF molecule; thus substantiating that P-2 ATPase system plays different roles in different tissues in response to an universal NaAF. Another rare feature of the HAF is that it has histone kinase activity, suggesting that the HAF and NaAF may be capable of sending a direct signal to the nucleus for gene expression.\xa0In this paper, the central role of the NaAF-regulated Na, K-ATPase system in the activity and function of brain tissue is discussed.\xa0 It is noted that the altered function of the nerve terminus located Na, K-ATPase system works as a Ca-pump (after depolarization) and as a Na-pump (in repolarization) in alternate sequence.

According to specific features of the symptoms, we hypothesized that alexithymia would not be correlated with this specific sexual disorder.54 outpatients with a diagnosis of DE assessed at the Institute of Clinical Sexology and the Urology Department of Sapienza, University in Rome were enrolled in the study. DE was diagnosed after a specialist examination and according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders -IV-TR criteria.

[u'The effects of behavioral control over stress on GABAergic spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents in prefrontal cortical pyramidal neurons', ['Juan A Varela', 'Jungang Wang', 'Donald C Cooper'], u'03 Apr 2013', u'Traumatic events may lead to anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, the majority of individuals exposed to trauma do not develop these disorders. The stressor controllability paradigm has been widely used as a model for understanding the neurobiology underlying factors that confer vulnerability and resilience to the outcome of traumatic events. In this paradigm rats receive a series of tail shocks: one group of rats have control over the termination of the shock by means of turning a wheel (escapable shock, ES), while the other \u201cyoked\u201d group of rats receive physically identical shocks but have no control over shock termination (inescapable shock, IS). In subsequent behavioral tests that model components of anxiety and depression, IS rats without control show increased signs of behavioral depression, while ES rats that have control over the shock behave as na\xefve home caged (HC) rats. We have previously reported that individual deep layer pyramidal neurons from the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) exhibit changes in their intrinsic excitability following ES. To examine if there is a corresponding reduction in synaptic inhibition, we tested IS, ES and HC deep layer pyramidal neurons under identical conditions. Collecting such electrophysiological data from pyramidal neurons after exposure to stress is a technical challenge, yet very useful for conductance-based neural simulations and computational modeling. \xa0Here we present a data set of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) gathered from whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of individual prefrontal cortical deep layer neurons from adult rats (60-70 days old) after exposure to ES, IS or HC.

[u'Neuronal activity-regulated gene transcription: how are distant synaptic signals conveyed to the nucleus?', ['Miriam Matamales'], u'19 Dec 2012', u'Synaptic activity can trigger gene expression programs that are required for the stable change of neuronal properties, a process that is essential for learning and memory. Currently, it is still unclear how the stimulation of dendritic synapses can be coupled to transcription in the nucleus in a timely way given that large distances can separate these two cellular compartments. Although several mechanisms have been proposed to explain long distance communication between synapses and the nucleus, the possible co-existence of these models and their relevance in physiological conditions remain elusive. One model suggests that synaptic activation triggers the translocation to the nucleus of certain transcription regulators localised at postsynaptic sites that function as synapto-nuclear messengers. Alternatively, it has been hypothesised that synaptic activity initiates propagating regenerative intracellular calcium waves that spread through dendrites into the nucleus where nuclear transcription machinery is thereby regulated. It has also been postulated that membrane depolarisation of voltage-gated calcium channels on the somatic membrane is sufficient to increase intracellular calcium concentration and activate transcription without the need for transported signals from distant synapses. Here I provide a critical overview of the suggested mechanisms for coupling synaptic stimulation to transcription, the underlying assumptions behind them and their plausible physiological significance.', u'/articles/1-69/v1', ['Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry', 'Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology'], [u'Centre for Ageing Dementia Research, Queensland Brain Institute, The University of Queensland, St Lucia, QLD 4072, Australia']]

Nutrition, including iron levels, affects cognitive function and thereby may influence the occupational performance of an individual. Inadequate nutrition during adulthood may lead to decreased work efficiency, poor exercise tolerance and increased susceptibility to infections. The profession of dentistry requires keen recognizing abilities and decision making skills as well as ample physical stamina, which may be impaired in a state of malnourishment. Keeping this in view, this study was designed to assess the possible impact of iron levels on cognitive function among dental students. In this study 206 dental students (150 females and 56 males) participated and their cognitive functioning was determined by answering a questionnaire. The questionnaire evaluated the confidence level, work pattern and the tendency to be distracted by the physical environment of the study participants. Iron status was determined by estimating the hemoglobin level of the individuals. Each of the three cognitive traits was correlated with hemoglobin levels. The results revealed that that majority of dental students had good levels of confidence, work patterns with a low level of restriction and low levels of distraction by the physical environment. No significant correlations were found between any of the cognitive parameters and hemoglobin levels (p>0.05) in female participants. In male participants significant correlations were found in two out of three cognitive functioning tests, confidence levels and work pattern (p<0.05).

However, the role of environmental agents in ALS remains poorly understood. To this end, we used transgenic fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) to explore the interaction between mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and chemicals such as \xdf-N-methylamino L-alanine (BMAA), the herbicide agent paraquat, and superoxide species. We expressed ALS-linked human SOD1 (hSOD1A4V, and hSOD1G85R), hSOD1wt as well as the Drosophila native SOD1 (dSOD1) in motoneurons (MNs) or in glial cells alone and simultaneously in both types of cells. We then examined the effect of BMAA (3 mM), paraquat (20 mM), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 1%) on the lifespan of SOD1-expressing flies. Our data show that glial expression of mutant and wild type hSOD1s reduces the ability of flies to climb. Further, we show that while all three chemicals significantly shorten the lifespan of flies, mutant SOD1 does not have a significant additional effect on the lifespan of flies fed on paraquat, but further shortens the lifespan of flies fed on H2O2. Finally, we show that BMAA shows a dramatic cell-type specific effect with mutant SOD1. Flies with expression of mutant hSOD1 in MNs survived longer on BMAA compared to control flies. In contrast, BMAA significantly shortened the lifespan of flies expressing mutant hSOD1 in glia. Consistent with a neuronal protection role, flies expressing these mutant hSOD1s in both MNs and glia also lived longer. Hence, our studies reveal a synergistic effect of mutant SOD1 with H2O2 and novel roles for mutant hSOD1s in neurons to reduce BMAA toxicity and in glia to enhance the toxicity of BMAA in flies.', u'/articles/1-47/v1', ['Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry', 'Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'Department of Biology, University of Oklahoma, Norman, OK, 73019, USA']]

Lovastatin, which demonstrates a cholesterol-lowering effect by the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase, may also have an anti-methanogenesis effect through direct inhibition of enzymes in the archaeal methanogenesis pathway. We conducted protein-ligand docking experiments to evaluate this possibility. Results are consistent with recent clinical findings.METHODS: F420-dependent methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase (mtd), a key methanogenesis enzyme with a known sequence but no tertiary protein structural information, was modeled for two different methanogenic archaea: M. smithii and Methanopyrus kandleri. Once protein models were developed, ligand-binding sites were identified. Multiple ligands and their respective protonation, isomeric and tautomeric representations were docked into each site, including F420-coenzyme (natural ligand), lactone and \u03b2-hydroxyacid forms of lovastatin and simvastatin, and other co-complexed ligands found in related crystal structures.RESULTS: 1) Generally, for each modeled site the lactone form of the statins had more favorable site interactions compared to F420; 2) The statin lactone forms generally had the most favorable docking scores, even relative to the native template PDB ligands; and 3) The statin \u03b2-hydroxyacid forms had less favorable docking scores, typically scoring in the middle with some of the F420 tautomeric forms. Consistent with these computational results were those from a recent phase II clinical trial (NCT02495623) with a proprietary, modified-release lovastatin-lactone (SYN-010) in patients with IBS-C, which showed a reduction in symptoms and breath methane levels, compared to placebo.CONCLUSION: The lactone form of lovastatin exhibits preferential binding over the native-F420 coenzyme ligand in silico and thus could inhibit the activity of the key M. smithii methanogenesis enzyme mtd in vivo.

In this study, we have addressed the question of molecular versus activity similarity in a more fundamental way. First, we have evaluated if activity-relevant similarity value ranges could in principle be identified for standard fingerprints and distinguished from similarity resulting from random compound comparisons. Then, we have analyzed if activity-relevant similarity values could be used to guide typical similarity search calculations aiming to identify active compounds in databases. It was found that activity-relevant similarity values can be identified as a characteristic feature of fingerprints. However, it was also shown that such values cannot be reliably used as thresholds for practical similarity search calculations.

For the last 15 years, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mode has been the standard for proteomics when sampling breadth and discovery were the main objectives; multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) LC-MS/MS has been the standard for targeted proteomics when precise quantification, reproducibility, and validation were the main objectives. Recently, improvements in mass spectrometer design and bioinformatics algorithms have resulted in the rediscovery and development of another sampling method: data-independent acquisition (DIA). DIA comprehensively and repeatedly samples every peptide in a protein digest, producing a complex set of mass spectra that is difficult to interpret without external spectral libraries. Currently, DIA approaches the identification breadth of DDA while achieving the reproducible quantification characteristic of MRM or its newest version, parallel reaction monitoring (PRM). In comparative de novo identification and quantification studies in human cell lysates, DIA identified up to 89% of the proteins detected in a comparable DDA experiment while providing reproducible quantification of over 85% of them. DIA analysis aided by spectral libraries derived from prior DIA experiments or auxiliary DDA data produces identification and quantification as reproducible and precise as that achieved by MRM/PRM, except on low\u2011abundance peptides that are obscured by stronger signals. DIA is still a work in progress toward the goal of sensitive, reproducible, and precise quantification without external spectral libraries. New software tools applied to DIA analysis have to deal with deconvolution of complex spectra as well as proper filtering of false positives and false negatives. However, the future outlook is positive, and various researchers are working on novel bioinformatics techniques to address these issues and increase the reproducibility, fidelity, and identification breadth of DIA.', u'/articles/5-419/v1', ['Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, 98109, USA']]

It consists of a membrane-bound histidine kinase, LytS, which belongs to the family of multiple transmembrane-spanning domains receptors, and a response regulator, LytR, which belongs to the novel family of non-helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain proteins. LytR regulates the expression of cidABC and lrgAB operons, the gene products of which are involved in programmed cell death and lysis. In vivo studies have demonstrated involvement of two overlapping regulatory networks in regulating the lrgAB operon, both depending on LytR. One regulatory network responds to glucose metabolism and the other responds to changes in the cell membrane potential. Herein, we show that LytS has autokinase activity and can catalyze a fast phosphotransfer reaction, with 50% of its phosphoryl group lost within 1 minute of incubation with LytR. LytS has also phosphatase activity. Notably, LytR undergoes phosphorylation by acetyl phosphate at a rate that is 2-fold faster than the phosphorylation by LytS. This observation is significant in lieu of the in vivo observations that regulation of the lrgAB operon is LytR-dependent in the presence of excess glucose in the medium. The latter condition does not lead to perturbation of the cell membrane potential but rather to the accumulation of acetate in the cell.

Dozens of algorithms designed to learn binding models (motifs) have generated many motifs available in research papers with a subset making it to databases like JASPAR, UniPROBE and Transfac. The presence of many versions of motifs from the various databases for a single TF and the lack of a standardized assessment technique makes it difficult for biologists to make an appropriate choice of binding model and for algorithm developers to benchmark, test and improve on their models. In this study, we review and evaluate the approaches in use, highlight differences and demonstrate the difficulty of defining a standardized motif assessment approach. We review scoring functions, motif length, test data and the type of performance metrics used in prior studies as some of the factors that influence the outcome of a motif assessment. We show that the scoring functions and statistics used in motif assessment influence ranking of motifs in a TF-specific manner. We also show that TF binding specificity can vary by source of genomic binding data.

These proteins are classified into type 1 (nsHbs-1) and type 2. The O2-affinity of nsHbs-1 is very high mostly because of an extremely low O2-dissociation rate constant resulting in that nsHbs-1 apparently do not release O2 after oxygenation. Thus, it is possible that the in vivo function of nsHbs-1 is other than O2-transport. Based on the properties of multiple Hbs it was proposed that nsHbs-1 could play diverse roles in rice organs, however the in vivo activity of rice nsHbs-1 has been poorly analyzed. An in vivo analysis for rice nsHbs-1 is essential to elucidate the biological function(s) of these proteins. Rice Hb1 and Hb2 are nsHbs-1 that have been generated in recombinant Escherichia coli TB1. The rice Hb1 and Hb2 amino acid sequence, tertiary structure and rate and equilibrium constants for the reaction of O2 are highly similar. Thus, it is possible that rice Hb1 and Hb2 function similarly in vivo. As an initial approach to test this hypothesis we analyzed the effect of the synthesis of rice Hb1 and Hb2 in the recombinant E. coli TB1 growth. Effect of the synthesis of the O2-carrying soybean leghemoglobin a, cowpea leghemoglobin II and Vitreoscilla Hb in the recombinant E. coli TB1 growth was also analyzed as an O2-carrier control.

Signaling pathways are studied using protein interaction networks constructed from protein-protein interaction data obtained from high-throughput experiments. However, these high-throughput methods are known to produce very high rates of false positive and negative interactions. To construct a useful protein interaction network from this noisy data, computational methods are applied to validate the protein-protein interactions. In this study, a computational technique to identify signaling pathways from a protein interaction network constructed using validated protein-protein interaction data was designed.A weighted interaction graph of Saccharomyces Cerevisiae was constructed. The weights were obtained using a Bayesian probabilistic network to estimate the posterior probability of interaction between two proteins given the gene expression measurement as biological evidence.

Mycobacteriophages often share little nucleotide similarity, but most of them have been grouped into lettered clusters and further into subclusters. Traditionally, mycobacteriophage genomes are analyzed based on sequence alignment or knowledge of gene content. However, these approaches are computationally expensive and can be ineffective for significantly diverged sequences. As an alternative to alignment-based genome analysis, we evaluated tetranucleotide usage in mycobacteriophage genomes. These methods make it easier to characterize features of the mycobacteriophage population at many scales.DescriptionWe computed tetranucleotide usage deviation (TUD), the ratio of observed counts of 4-mers in a genome to the expected count under a null model. TUD values are comparable between members of a phage subcluster and distinct between subclusters. With few exceptions, neighbor joining phylogenetic trees and hierarchical clustering dendrograms constructed using TUD values place phages in a monophyletic clade with members of the same subcluster. Regions in a genome with exceptional TUD values can point to interesting features of genomic architecture. Finally, we found that subcluster B3 mycobacteriophages contain significantly overrepresented 4-mers and 6-mers that are atypical of phage genomes.ConclusionsStatistics based on tetranucleotide usage support established clustering of mycobacteriophages and can uncover interesting relationships within and between sequenced phage genomes.

[u'Characterization of known protein complexes using k-connectivity and other topological measures', ['Suzanne R Gallagher', 'Debra S Goldberg'], u'09 Oct 2015', u'Many protein complexes are densely packed, so proteins within complexes often interact with several other proteins in the complex. Steric constraints prevent most proteins from simultaneously binding more than a handful of other proteins, regardless of the number of proteins in the complex. Because of this, as complex size increases, several measures of the complex decrease within protein-protein interaction networks. However, k-connectivity, the number of vertices or edges that need to be removed in order to disconnect a graph, may be consistently high for protein complexes. The property of k-connectivity has been little used previously in the investigation of protein-protein interactions. To understand the discriminative power of k-connectivity and other topological measures for identifying unknown protein complexes, we characterized these properties in known Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein complexes in networks generated both from highly accurate X-ray crystallography experiments which give an accurate model of each complex, and also as the complexes appear in high-throughput yeast 2-hybrid studies in which new complexes may be discovered.

[u'Intracellular Dynamics of the Ubiquitin-Proteasome-System', ['Maisha Chowdhury', 'Cordula Enenkel'], u'28 Sep 2015', u'The ubiquitin-proteasome system is the major degradation pathway for short-lived proteins in eukaryotic cells. Targets of the ubiquitin-proteasome-system are proteins regulating a broad range of cellular processes including cell cycle progression, gene expression, the quality control of proteostasis and the response to geno- and proteotoxic stress. Prior to degradation, the proteasomal substrate is marked with a poly-ubiquitin chain. The key protease of the ubiquitin system is the proteasome. In dividing cells, proteasomes exist as holo-enzymes composed of regulatory and core particles. The regulatory complex confers ubiquitin-recognition and ATP dependence on proteasomal protein degradation. The catalytic sites are located in the proteasome core particle. Proteasome holo-enzymes are predominantly nuclear suggesting a major requirement for proteasomal proteolysis in the nucleus. In cell cycle arrested mammalian or quiescent yeast cells, proteasomes deplete from the nucleus and accumulate in granules at the nuclear envelope (NE) / endoplasmic reticulum ( ER) membranes. In prolonged quiescence, proteasome granules drop off the nuclear envelopeNE / ER membranes and migrate as droplet-like entitiesstable organelles \xa0throughout the cytoplasm, as thoroughly investigated in yeast. When quiescence yeast cells are allowed to resume growth, proteasome granules clear and proteasomes are rapidly imported into the nucleus.Here, we summarize our knowledge about the enigmatic structure of proteasome storage granules and the trafficking of proteasomes and their substrates between the cyto- and nucleoplasm.Most of our current knowledge is based on studies in yeast.

[u'Amicon-adapted enhanced FASP: an in-solution digestion-based alternative sample preparation method to FASP', ['David Pellerin', 'Hugo Gagnon', 'Jean Dube', 'Francois Corbin'], u'24 Sep 2015', u'Sample preparation is a crucial step for liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based proteomics. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) is a powerful denaturing detergent that allows for long-term preservation of protein integrity. However, as it inhibits trypsin and interferes with LC-MS/MS analyses, it must be removed from samples prior to these experiments. The Filter-Aided Sample Preparation (FASP) method is actually one of the preferred and simplest methods for such purpose. Nonetheless, there exist great disparities in the quality of outcomes when comparing FASP to other protocols depending on the authors, and recent reports have pointed to concerns regarding its depth of proteome coverage. To address these issues, we propose an Amicon-adapted in-solution-based enhanced FASP (eFASP) approach that relies on current best practices in comprehensive proteomics sample preparation. Human megakaryoblastic leukaemia cancer cells\u2019 protein extracts were treated in parallel with both Amicon-adapted eFASP and FASP, quantified for remaining SDS and then analyzed with a 1-hr gradient LC-MS/MS run. The Amicon-adapted eFASP utilizes a passivated low molecular weight cut-off Amicon filter, and incorporates a cleaning step with a high-content deoxycholate buffer and a \u2018one-step-two-enzymes\u2019 trypsin/Lys-C in-solution digestion. Amicon-adapted eFASP was found more reproducible and deepened proteome coverage, especially for membrane proteins. As compared to FASP, Amicon-adapted eFASP removed much of SDS from high-protein samples and reached a notable depth of proteome coverage with nearly 1,700 proteins identified in a 1 hr LC-MS/MS single-run analysis without prior fractionation.

The most frequent mutation, F508del, leads to the synthesis of a prematurely degraded, otherwise partially functional protein. CFTR is expressed in many epithelia, with major consequences in the airways of patients with CF, characterized by both fluid transport abnormalities and persistent inflammatory responses. The relationship between the acute phase of inflammation and the expression of wild type (WT) CFTR or F508del-CFTR is poorly understood. The aim of the present study was to investigate this effect. The results show that 10 min exposure to TNF-alpha (0.5-50ng/ml) of F508del-CFTR-transfected HeLa cells and human bronchial cells expressing F508del-CFTR in primary culture (HBE) leads to the maturation of F508del-CFTR and induces CFTR chloride currents. The enhanced CFTR expression and function upon TNF\u03b1 is sustained, in HBE cells, for at least 24 h. The underlying mechanism of action involves a protein kinase C (PKC) signaling pathway, and occurs through insertion of vesicles containing F508del-CFTR to the plasma membrane, with TNF\u03b1 behaving as a corrector molecule.

There are methods to visualise and aid the interpretation of these results, but most of them are limited to the results associated with one list of genes. However, in practice the number of gene lists can be considerably higher and common tools are not effective in such situations.We introduce a novel R package, 'GOsummaries' that visualises the GO enrichment results as concise word clouds that can be combined together if the number of gene lists is larger. By also adding the graphs of corresponding raw experimental data, GOsummaries can create informative summary plots for various analyses such as differential expression or clustering.

Besides its ability to bind to phospholipid membranes, the N-terminus of NP7, a member of the NO transporter nitrophorin family, contains an additional Leu-Pro-Gly stretch, which is a unique sequence trait, and the heme cavity is significantly altered with respect to other nitrophorins. These distinctive features encouraged us to solve the X-ray crystallographic structures of NP7 at low and high pH and bound with different heme ligands (nitric oxide, histamine, imidazole). The overall fold of the lipocalin motif is well preserved in the different X-ray structures and resembles the fold of other nitrophorins. However, a chain-like arrangement in the crystal lattice due to a number of head-to-tail electrostatic stabilizing interactions is found in NP7. Furthermore, the X-ray structures also reveal ligand-dependent changes in the orientation of the heme, as well as in specific interactions between the A-B and G-H loops, which are considered to be relevant for the biological function of nitrophorins. Fast and ultrafast laser triggered ligand rebinding experiments demonstrate the pH-dependent ligand migration within the cavities and the exit route. Finally, the topological distribution of pockets located around the heme as well as from inner cavities present at the rear of the protein provides a distinctive feature in NP7, so that while a loop gated exit mechanism to the solvent has been proposed for most nitrophorins, a more complex mechanism that involves several interconnected gas hosting cavities is proposed for NP7.', u'/articles/4-45/v2', ['Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'Max-Planck-Institut f\xfcr Chemische Energiekonversion, M\xfclheim an der Ruhr, 45470, Germany', u'Dipartimento di Fisica e Scienze della Terra, Universit\xe0 di Parma, Parma, 43124, Italy', u'Dipartimento di Bioscienze, Universit\xe0 di Parma, Parma, 43124, Italy', u'NEST, Istituto Nanoscienze, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Pisa, 56127, Italy', u'Dipartimento di Farmacia, Universit\xe0 di Parma, Parma, 43124, Italy', u'Dipartimento di Fisica, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, 20133, Italy', u'Departament de Fisicoqu\xedmica, Facultat de Farma\u0300cia and Institute of Biomedicine, Universitat de Barcelona, Santa Coloma de Gramenet, E-08921, Spain']]

Similar peptides affect diverse physiological pathways in different species or even within the same organism. Assuming that signals provide information, and that this information is tested by the structure of the signal, it is curious that highly similar signaling peptides appear to provide information relevant to very different metabolic processes. Here we suggest a solution to this problem: the synthesis of the propeptide, and its post-translational modifications that are required for its cleavage and the production of the mature peptide, provide information on the phenotypic state of the signaling cell. The mature peptide, due to its chemical properties which render it harmful, serves as a stimulant that forces cells to respond to this information. To support this suggestion, we present cases of signaling peptides in which the sequence and structure of the mature peptide is similar yet provides diverse information. The sequence of the propeptide and its post-translational modifications, which represent the phenotypic state of the signaling cell, determine the quantity and specificity of the information.

Three evolutionary families have been identified in Glbs: the M, S and T Glb families. The M Glbs include flavohemoglobins (fHbs) and single-domain Glbs (SDgbs); the S Glbs include globin-coupled sensors (GCSs), protoglobins and sensor single domain globins, and the T Glbs include truncated Glbs (tHbs). Structurally, the M and S Glbs exhibit 3/3-folding whereas the T Glbs exhibit 2/2-folding. Glbs are widespread in bacteria, including several rhizobial genomes. However, only few rhizobial Glbs have been characterized. Hence, we characterized Glbs from 62 rhizobial genomes using bioinformatics methods such as data mining in databases, sequence alignment, phenogram construction and protein modeling. Also, we analyzed soluble extracts from Bradyrhizobium japonicum USDA38 and USDA58 by (reduced + carbon monoxide (CO) minus reduced) differential spectroscopy. Database searching showed that only fhb, sdgb, gcs and thb genes exist in the rhizobia analyzed in this work. Promoter analysis revealed that apparently several rhizobial glb genes are not regulated by a -10 promoter but might be regulated by -35 and Fnr (fumarate-nitrate reduction regulator)-like promoters. Mapping analysis revealed that rhizobial fhbs and thbs are flanked by a variety of genes whereas several rhizobial sdgbs and gcss are flanked by genes coding for proteins involved in the metabolism of nitrates and nitrites and chemotaxis, respectively. Phenetic analysis showed that rhizobial Glbs segregate into the M, S and T Glb families, while structural analysis showed that predicted rhizobial SDgbs and fHbs and GCSs globin domain and tHbs fold into the 3/3- and 2/2-folding, respectively.

The incorporation of methyl, hydroxymethyl, formyl and carboxy substituents at the 5-position of cytosine is shown to hardly affect the geometry of CG base pairs, but to result in rather larger changes to hydrogen-bond and stacking binding energies, as predicted by dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT) methods. The same modifications within double-stranded GCG and ACA trimers exhibit rather larger structural effects, when including the sugar-phosphate backbone as well as sodium counterions and implicit aqueous solvation. In particular, changes are observed in the buckle and propeller angles within base pairs and the slide and roll values of base pair steps, but these leave the overall helical shape of DNA essentially intact. The structures so obtained are useful as a benchmark of faster methods, including molecular mechanics (MM) and hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods. We show that previously developed MM parameters satisfactorily reproduce the trimer structures, as do QM/MM calculations which treat bases with dispersion-corrected DFT and the sugar-phosphate backbone with AMBER. The latter are improved by inclusion of all six bases in the QM region, since a truncated model including only the central CG base pair in the QM region is considerably further from the DFT structure. This QM/MM method is then applied to a set of double-stranded DNA heptamers derived from a recent X-ray crystallographic study, whose size puts a DFT study beyond our current computational resources.

However, to the best of our knowledge, no single comprehensive dataset has been properly explored to date.Thus, researchers evaluate multiple datasets in order to construct representative CCs; this can be quite difficult, but one feasible solution for such an evaluation is to manage all available data as one discrete signal, which allows signal processing tools (SPTs) to be implemented during data analysis.In this research, we present a proof-of-concept study that shows the possibility of mapping to a discrete signal any type of data available from genetic resource collections in order to take advantage of SPTs for the construction of CCs that adequately represent the diversity of two crops. This method is referred to as 'SPT selection.'All available information for each element of the tested collections was analysed under this perspective and compared, when possible, with one of the most used algorithms for CC selection.Genotype-only SPT selection did not prove as effective as standard CC selection algorithms; however, the SPT approach can consider genotype alongside other types of information, which results in well-represented CCs that consider both the genotypic and agromorphological diversities present in original collections.Furthermore, SPT-based analysis can evaluate all available data both in a comprehensive manner and under different perspectives, and despite its limitations, the analysis renders satisfactory results.

Results for natural splice site mutations can be interrogated dynamically with Splicing Mutation Calculator, a companion software program that computes changes in information content for any splice site substitution, linked to corresponding publications containing these mutations. The accuracy of IT-based analysis was assessed in the context of experimentally validated mutations. Because splice site information quantifies binding affinity, IT-based analyses can discern the differences between variants that account for the observed reduced (leaky) versus abolished mRNA splicing. We extend this principle by comparing predicted mutations in natural, cryptic, and regulatory splice sites with observed deleterious phenotypic and benign effects. Our analysis of 1727 variants revealed a number of general principles useful for ensuring portability of these analyses and accurate input and interpretation of mutations. We offer guidelines for optimal use of IT software for interpretation of mRNA splicing mutations.', u'/articles/3-282/v2', ['Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'Department of Biochemistry, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, Western University, London, ON, N6A 2C1, Canada', u'Departments of Biochemistry and Computer Science, Western University, London, ON, N6A 2C1, Canada']]
[u'Effects of mutations on the molecular dynamics of oxygen escape from the dimeric hemoglobin of Scapharca inaequivalvis', ['Kevin Trujillo', 'Tasso Papagiannopoulos', 'Kenneth W. Olsen'], u'13 Mar 2015', u'Like many hemoglobins, the structure of the dimeric hemoglobin from the clam Scapharca inaequivalvis is a \u201cclosed bottle\u201d since there is no direct tunnel from the oxygen binding site on the heme to the solvent.\xa0 The proximal histidine faces the dimer interface, which consists of the E and F helicies.\xa0 This is significantly different from tetrameric vertebrate hemoglobins and brings the heme groups near the subunit interface. The subunit interface is also characterized by an immobile, hydrogen-bonded network of water molecules.\xa0 Although there is data which is consistent with the histidine gate pathway for ligand escape, these aspects of the structure would seem to make that pathway less likely. Locally enhanced sampling molecular dynamics are used here to suggest alternative pathways in the wild-type and six mutant proteins. In most cases the point mutations change the selection of exit routes observed in the simulations. Exit via the histidine gate is rarely seem although oxygen molecules do occasionally cross over the interface from one subunit to the other. The results suggest that changes in flexibility and, in some cases, creation of new cavities can explain the effects of the mutations on ligand exit paths.', u'/articles/4-65/v1', ['Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Loyola University Chicago, Chicago, IL, 60660, USA']]

[u'Advantages of distributed and parallel algorithms that leverage Cloud Computing platforms for large-scale genome assembly.', ['Priti Kumari', 'Raja Mazumder', 'Vahan Simonyan', 'Konstantinos Krampis'], u'22 Jan 2015', u'Background: The transition to Next Generation sequencing (NGS) sequencing technologies has had numerous applications in Plant, Microbial and Human genomics during the past decade. However, NGS sequencing trades high read throughput for shorter read length, increasing the difficulty for genome assembly. This research presents a comparison of traditional versus Cloud computing-based genome assembly software, using as examples the Velvet and Contrail assemblers and reads from the genome sequence of the zebrafish (Danio rerio) model organism.Results: The first phase of the analysis involved a subset of the zebrafish data set (2X coverage) and best results were obtained using K-mer size of 65, while it was observed that Velvet takes less time than Contrail to complete the assembly. In the next phase, genome assembly was attempted using the full dataset of read coverage 192x and while Velvet failed to complete on a 256GB memory compute server, Contrail completed but required 240hours of computation.Conclusion: This research concludes that for deciding on which assembler software to use, the size of the dataset and available computing hardware should be taken into consideration. For a relatively small sequencing dataset, such as microbial or small eukaryotic genome, the Velvet assembler is a good option. However, for larger datasets Velvet requires large-memory\xa0 compute servers in the order of 1000GB or more. On the other hand, Contrail is implemented\xa0 using Hadoop, which performs the assembly in parallel across nodes of a compute cluster.

Transcriptomic profiling of NKX3.1-negative prostate epithelial cells acutely expressing NKX3.1 revealed a rapid and complex response that is a near mirror image of the gene expression signature of human prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). Pathway and network analyses suggested that NKX3.1 actuates a cellular reprogramming toward luminal cell differentiation characterized by suppression of pro-oncogenic c-MYC and interferon-STAT signaling and activation of tumor suppressor pathways. Consistently, ectopic expression of NKX3.1 conferred a growth arrest depending on TNF\u03b1 and JNK signaling.

[u'Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy study of\xa0ligand photodissociation and migration in inducible nitric oxide synthase', ['Michael Horn', 'Karin Nienhaus', 'Gerd Ulrich Nienhaus'], u'12 Dec 2014', u'Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is a homodimeric heme enzyme that catalyzes the formation of nitric oxide (NO) from dioxygen and L-arginine (L-Arg) in a two-step process. The produced NO can either diffuse out of the heme pocket into the surroundings or it can rebind to the heme iron and inhibit enzyme action. Here we have employed Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) photolysis difference spectroscopy at cryogenic temperatures, using the carbon monoxide (CO) and NO stretching bands as local probes of the active site of iNOS. Characteristic changes were observed in the spectra of the heme-bound ligands upon binding of the cofactors. Unlike photolyzed CO, which becomes trapped in well-defined orientations, as indicated by sharp photoproduct bands, photoproduct bands of NO photodissociated from the ferric heme iron were not visible, indicating that NO does not reside in the protein interior in a well-defined location or orientation. This may be favorable for NO release from the enzyme during catalysis because it reduces self-inhibition. Moreover, we used temperature derivative spectroscopy (TDS) with FTIR monitoring to explore the dynamics of NO and carbon monoxide (CO) inside iNOS after photodissociation at cryogenic temperatures. Only a single kinetic photoproduct state was revealed, but no secondary docking sites as in hemoglobins. Interestingly, we observed that intense illumination of six-coordinate ferrous iNOSoxy-NO ruptures the bond between the heme iron and the proximal thiolate to yield five-coordinate ferric iNOSoxy-NO, demonstrating the strong trans effect of the heme-bound NO.', u'/articles/3-290/v2', ['Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Institute of Applied Physics, Karlsruhe, D-76131, Germany', u'Department of Physics, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, 61801, USA']]

The recombinant THB1 (rTHB1) has favorable solubility and stability properties and is an excellent candidate for in vitro characterization. Linking rTHB1 to the in vivo protein is a critical step in understanding the physiologic function of this protein. Using a simplified three-step purification protocol, 3.5-L batches of algal culture were processed to isolate 50\u201360 \u03bcL fractions enriched in THB1.

Protein docking methods (AutoDock, GOLD, DOCK, FlexX and Glide to name a few) rank a large number of possible conformations of protein-ligand complexes using fast algorithms. Previously, it has been shown that structural congruence leading to the same enzymatic function necessitates the congruence of electrostatic properties (CLASP). The current work presents a methodology for docking a ligand into a target protein, provided that there is at least one known holoenzyme with ligand bound - DOCLASP (Docking using CLASP). The contact points of the ligand in the holoenzyme defines a motif, which is used to query the target enzyme using CLASP. If there are no significant matches, the ligand cannot be docked in the protein. Otherwise, the holoenzyme and the target protein are superimposed based on congruent atoms. The same linear and rotational transformations are also applied to the ligand, thus creating a unified coordinate framework having the holoenzyme, the ligand and the target enzyme. This provides the docked ligand in the target enzyme. Previously, CLASP was used to predict and validate (in vivo) the inhibition of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) from Bacillus cereus by two dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP4) inhibitors - vildagliptin and K-579.

These promiscuity rates are lower than often assumed. When the stringency of data selection criteria was reduced in subsequent steps, non-realistic increases in promiscuity rates from ~6 targets per drug in 2000 to more than 28 targets were obtained.

In some instances, such effects are easy to detect, in others they are not. Observed promiscuity of compounds might be due to such non-specific assay artifacts. By contrast, promiscuity might also result from specific interactions with multiple targets. In the latter case, promiscuous compounds can be attractive candidates for certain therapeutic applications. However, compounds with artificial activity readouts are often not recognized and are further progressed, which presents a substantial problem for drug discovery.

Methods that predict putative structures from sequences typically yield multiple, closely-ranked possibilities. A critical component in the process is the model quality assessing program (MQAP), which selects the best candidate from this pool of structures. Here, we present a novel MQAP based on the physical properties of sidechain atoms. We propose a method for assessing the quality of protein structures based on the electrostatic potential difference (EPD) of C\u03b2 atoms in consecutive residues. We demonstrate that the EPDs of C\u03b2 atoms on consecutive residues provide unique signatures of the amino acid types. The EPD of C\u03b2 atoms are learnt from a set of 1000 non-homologous protein structures with a resolution cuto of 1.6 \xc5 obtained from the PISCES database. Based on the Boltzmann hypothesis that lower energy conformations are proportionately sampled more, and on Annsen's thermodynamic hypothesis that the native structure of a protein is the minimum free energy state, we hypothesize that the deviation of observed EPD values from the mean values obtained in the learning phase is minimized in the native structure.

Experiments were performed in microgravity during parabolic flights, and compared to 1g on ground results using identical equipment and procedures in all cases. Our results revealed that sufficient equipment accuracy and analytical sensitivity were reached to detect transport activity in both gravitational conditions. Additionally, transport activity levels of on ground samples were within commercial transport standards, proving the validity of the methods and equipment used. MRP2 net transport activity was significantly reduced in microgravity, so was signal detected in simple diffusion samples. Ultra-structural changes induced by gravitational stress upon vesicle membranes or transporters could explain the current results, although alternative explanations are possible.

The percentage of genetic material constituted by guanosine and cytosine (GC) nucleotides ranges from 20% to 70%. \xa0It has been posited that GC-poor organisms are more dependent on protein folding machinery. Previous studies have ascribed this to the accumulation of mildly deleterious mutations in these organisms due to population bottlenecks. This phenomenon has been supported by protein folding simulations, which showed that proteins encoded by GC-poor organisms are more prone to aggregation than proteins encoded by GC-rich organisms. To test this proposition using a genome-wide approach, we classified different eubacterial proteomes in terms of their aggregation propensity and chaperone-dependence using multiple machine learning models. In contrast to the expected decrease in protein aggregation with an increase in GC richness, we found that the aggregation propensity of proteomes increases with GC content. A similar and even more significant correlation was obtained with the GroEL-dependence of proteomes: GC-poor proteomes have evolved to be less dependent on GroEL than GC-rich proteomes.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of chromosome substitution on intrinsic exercise capacity and identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with exercise capacity in mice. Mice from a chromosome substitution strain (CSS) derived from A/J and C57Bl/6J (B6), denoted as B6.A14, were used to assess the contribution of Chromosome 14 to intrinsic exercise capacity. All mice performed a graded exercise test to exhaustion to determine exercise capacity expressed as time (min) or work (kg\xb7m). Exercise time and work were significantly greater in B6 mice than B6.A14 and A/J mice, indicating the presence of a QTL on Chromosome 14 for exercise capacity. To localize exercise-related QTL, 155 B6.A14 x B6 F2 mice were generated for linkage analysis. Suggestive QTL for exercise time (57 cM, 1.75 LOD) and work (57 cM, 2.08 LOD) were identified in the entire B6.A14 x B6 F2 cohort. To identify putative sex-specific QTL, male and female F2 cohorts were analyzed separately.\xa0 In males, a significant QTL for exercise time (55 cM, 2.28 LOD) and a suggestive QTL for work (55 cM, 2.19 LOD) were identified.\xa0 In the female cohort, no QTL was identified for time, but a suggestive QTL for work was located at 16 cM (1.8 LOD). These data suggest that one or more QTL on Chromosome 14 regulate exercise capacity. The putative sex-specific QTL further suggest that the genetic architecture underlying exercise capacity is different in males and females.\xa0 Overall, the results of this study support the use of CSS as a model for the genetic analysis of exercise capacity.

Borisy'], u'20 May 2014', u'RNA interference (RNAi) is widely used to suppress gene expression in a specific manner. The efficacy of RNAi is mainly dependent on the sequence of small interfering RNA (siRNA) in relation to the target mRNA. Although several algorithms have been developed for the design of siRNA, it is still difficult to choose a really effective siRNA from among multiple candidates. In this article, we report the development of an image-based, quantitative, ratiometric fluorescence reporter assay to evaluate the efficacy of RNAi at the single-cell level. Two fluorescence reporter constructs are used. One expresses the candidate small hairpin RNA (shRNA) together with an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP); the other expresses a 19-nt target sequence inserted into a cassette expressing a red fluorescent protein (either DsRed or mCherry). Effectiveness of the candidate shRNA is evaluated as the extent to which it knocks down expression of the red fluorescent protein. Thus, the red-to-green fluorescence intensity ratio (appropriately normalized to controls) is used as the read-out for quantifying the siRNA efficacy at the individual cell level. We tested this dual fluorescence assay and compared predictions to actual endogenous knockdown levels for three different genes (vimentin, lamin A/C and Arp3) and twenty different shRNAs. For each of the genes, our assay successfully predicted the target sequences for effective RNAi.To further facilitate testing of RNAi efficacy, we developed a negative selection marker (ccdB) method for construction of shRNA and red fluorescent reporter plasmids that allowed us to purify these plasmids directly from transformed bacteria without the need for colony selection and DNA sequencing verification.', u'/articles/3-60/v2', ['Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'Department of Life Science, Faculty of Science, Gakushuin University, Tokyo, 171-8588, Japan', u'The Forsyth Institute, Cambridge, MA, MA 02142, USA']]
[u'Thiolation-enhanced substrate recognition by D-alanyl carrier protein ligase DltA from Bacillus cereus', ['Liqin Du', 'Yu Luo'], u'13 May 2014', u'D-alanylation of the lipoteichoic acid on Gram-positive cell wall is dependent on dlt gene-encoded proteins DltA, DltB, DltC and DltD. The D-alanyl carrier protein ligase DltA, as a remote homolog of acyl-(coenzyme A) (CoA) synthetase, cycles through two active conformations for the catalysis of adenylation and subsequent thiolation of D-alanine (D-Ala). The crystal structure of DltA in the absence of any substrate was observed to have a noticeably more disordered pocket for ATP which would explain why DltA has relatively low affinity for ATP in the absence of any D-alanyl carrier. We have previously enabled the thiolation of D-alanine in the presence of CoA as the mimic of D-alanyl carrier protein DltC which carries a 4\u2019-phosphopantetheine group on a serine residue. Here we show that the resulting Michaelis constants in the presence of saturating CoA for both ATP and D-alanine were reduced more than 10 fold as compared to the values obtained in the absence of CoA. The presence of CoA also made DltA ~100-fold more selective on D-alanine over L-alanine. The CoA-enhanced substrate recognition further implies that the ATP and D-alanine substrates of the adenylation reaction are incorporated when the DltA enzyme cycles through its thiolation conformation.', u'/articles/3-106/v1', ['Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'Department of Biochemistry, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, S7N 5E5, Canada']]

In pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) it has been proposed that nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) triggers increases in cytoplasmic Ca2+ via L-SR junctions, in a manner that requires initial Ca2+ release from lysosomes and subsequent Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) via ryanodine receptor (RyR) subtype 3 on the SR membrane proximal to lysosomes. L-SR junction membrane separation has been estimated to be < 400 nm and thus beyond the resolution of light microscopy, which has restricted detailed investigations of the junctional coupling process. The present study utilizes standard and tomographic transmission electron microscopy to provide a thorough ultrastructural characterization of the L-SR junctions in PASMCs. We show that L-SR nanojunctions are prominent features within these cells and estimate that the junctional membrane separation and extension are about 15 nm and 300 nm, respectively. Furthermore, we develop a quantitative model of the L-SR junction using these measurements, prior kinetic and specific Ca2+ signal information as input data. Simulations of NAADP-dependent junctional Ca2+ transients demonstrate that the magnitude of these signals can breach the threshold for CICR via RyR3. By correlation analysis of live cell Ca2+ signals and simulated Ca2+ transients within L-SR junctions, we estimate that \u201ctrigger zones\u201d comprising 60\u2013100 junctions are required to confer a signal of similar magnitude. This is compatible with the 110 lysosomes/cell estimated from our ultrastructural observations. Most importantly, our model shows that increasing the L-SR junctional width above 50 nm lowers the magnitude of junctional [Ca2+] such that there is a failure to breach the threshold for CICR via RyR3.

[u'Rapid and inexpensive body fluid identification by RNA profiling-based multiplex High Resolution Melt (HRM) analysis', ['Erin K. Hanson', 'Jack Ballantyne'], u'26 Feb 2014', u'Positive identification of the nature of biological material present on evidentiary items can be crucial for understanding the circumstances surrounding a crime. However, traditional protein-based methods do not permit the identification of all body fluids and tissues, and thus molecular based strategies for the conclusive identification of all forensically relevant biological fluids and tissues need to be developed. Messenger RNA (mRNA) profiling is an example of such a molecular-based approach. Current mRNA body fluid identification assays involve capillary electrophoresis (CE) or quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) platforms, each with its own limitations. Both platforms require the use of expensive fluorescently labeled primers or probes. CE-based assays require separate amplification and detection steps thus increasing the analysis time. For qRT-PCR assays, only 3-4 markers can be included in a single reaction since each requires a different fluorescent dye.To simplify mRNA profiling assays, and reduce the time and cost of analysis, we have developed single- and multiplex body fluid High Resolution Melt (HRM) assays for the identification of common forensically relevant biological fluids and tissues. The incorporated biomarkers include IL19 (vaginal secretions), IL1F7 (skin), ALAS2 (blood), MMP10 (menstrual blood), HTN3 (saliva) and TGM4 (semen).\xa0 The HRM assays require only unlabeled PCR primers and a single saturating intercalating fluorescent dye (Eva Green). Each body-fluid-specific marker can easily be identified by the presence of a distinct melt peak. Usually, HRM assays are used to detect variants or isoforms for a single gene target. However, we have uniquely developed duplex and triplex HRM assays to permit the simultaneous detection of multiple targets per reaction. Here we describe the development and initial performance evaluation of the developed HRM assays.

Oliver', 'Michael Hackenberg'], u'21 Feb 2014', u'Whole genome methylation profiling at a single cytosine resolution is now feasible due to the advent of high-throughput sequencing techniques together with bisulfite treatment of the DNA. To obtain the methylation value of each individual cytosine, the bisulfite-treated sequence reads are first aligned to a reference genome, and then the profiling of the methylation levels is done from the alignments. A huge effort has been made to quickly and correctly align the reads and many different algorithms and programs to do this have been created. However, the second step is just as crucial and non-trivial, but much less attention has been paid to the final inference of the methylation states. Important error sources do exist, such as sequencing errors, bisulfite failure, clonal reads, and single nucleotide variants.We developed MethylExtract, a user friendly tool to: i) generate high quality, whole genome methylation maps and ii) detect sequence variation within the same sample preparation. The program is implemented into a single script and takes into account all major error sources. MethylExtract detects variation (SNVs \u2013 Single Nucleotide Variants) in a similar way to VarScan, a very sensitive method extensively used in SNV and genotype calling based on non-bisulfite-treated reads. The usefulness of MethylExtract is shown by means of extensive benchmarking based on artificial bisulfite-treated reads and a comparison to a recently published method, called Bis-SNP.MethylExtract is able to detect SNVs within High-Throughput Sequencing experiments of bisulfite treated DNA at the same time as it generates high quality methylation maps. This simultaneous detection of DNA methylation and sequence variation is crucial for many downstream analyses, for example when deciphering the impact of SNVs on differential methylation. An exclusive feature of MethylExtract, in comparison with existing software, is the possibility to assess the bisulfite failure in a statistical way.

The mammalian genome encodes nine protein arginine methyltransferases (Prmts) that catalyze monomethylation, asymmetric dimethylation, and symmetric dimethylation on arginine residues. Protein arginine methyltransferase 7 (Prmt7) is categorized as a type II and type III enzyme that produces symmetric dimethylated arginine and monomethylated arginine, respectively. However, the biological role of Prmt7 is not well characterized. We previously showed that Prmt5, a type II Prmt that associates with Brg1-based SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, is required for adipocyte differentiation. Since Prmt7 also associates with Brg1-based SWI/SNF complex and modifies core histones, we hypothesized that Prmt7 might play a role in transcriptional regulation of adipogenesis. In the present study, we determined that the expression of Prmt7 did not change throughout adipogenic differentiation of C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal cells. Knockdown or over-expression of Prmt7 had no effect on lipid accumulation or adipogenic gene expression in differentiating C3H10T1/2 cells or in C/EBP\u03b1-reprogrammed NIH3T3 fibroblasts.

Two main computational approaches have evolved to obtain the structure from the protein sequence - ab initio/de novo methods and template-based modeling - both of which typically generate multiple possible native state structures. Model quality assessment programs (MQAP) validate these predicted structures in order to identify the correct native state structure. Here, we propose a MQAP for assessing the quality of protein structures based on the distances of consecutive C\u03b1 atoms. We hypothesize that the root-mean-square deviation of the distance of consecutive C\u03b1 (RDCC) atoms from the ideal value of 3.8 \xc5, derived from a statistical analysis of high quality protein structures (top100H database), is minimized in native structures. Based on tests with the top100H set, we propose a RDCC cutoff value of 0.012 \xc5, above which a structure can be filtered out as a non-native structure. We applied the RDCC discriminator on decoy sets from the Decoys 'R' Us database to show that the native structures in all decoy sets tested have RDCC below the 0.012 \xc5 cutoff. While most decoy sets were either indistinguishable using this discriminator or had very few violations, all the decoy structures in the fisa decoy set were discriminated by applying the RDCC criterion. This highlights the physical non-viability of the fisa decoy set, and possible issues in benchmarking other methods using this set.

This fundamental change in the functional objects of quasispecies theory allows us to show that previously measured aneuploidy rates in cancer populations are already close to a formally derived aneuploid error threshold, and that any value of aneuploidy rate larger than the aneuploid error threshold would lead to a loss of fitness of a tumor population. Finally, we make a phenomenological analysis of existing experimental evidence to argue that single clone cancer cells, derived from an aneuploid cancer subpopulation, are capable of self-regulating their aneuploidy rate and of adapting it to distinct environments, namely primary and metastatic microenvironments.

Conserved fragments of 30 amino acids (BRC repeats), which mediate interactions with the recombinase RAD51, helped detect orthologs of this protein in other organisms. The carboxy-terminal of the human BRCA2 has been shown to be phosphorylated by checkpoint kinases (Chk1/Chk2) at T3387, which regulate the sequestration of RAD51 on DNA damage. However, apart from three BRC repeats, the Drosophila melanogaster gene has not been annotated and associated with other functionally relevant sequence fragments in human BRCA2. In the current work, the carboxy-terminal phosphorylation threonine site (E=9.1e-4) and a new BRC repeat (E=17e-4) in D. melanogaster has been identified, using a fragmented alignment methodology (FRAGAL). In a similar study, FRAGAL has also identified a novel half-a- tetratricopeptide (HAT) motif (E=11e-4), a helical repeat motif implicated in various aspects of RNA metabolism, in Utp6 from yeast. The characteristic three aromatic residues with conserved spacing are observed in this new HAT repeat, further strengthening my claim. The reference and target sequences are sliced into overlapping fragments of equal parameterized lengths. All pairs of fragments in the reference and target proteins are aligned, and the gap penalties are adjusted to discourage gaps in the middle of the alignment. The results of the best matches are sorted based on differing criteria to aid the detection of known and putative sequences.

P-values that describe both miRNA-targeted-gene promoter methylation and miRNA regulation of target genes were computed using the MiRaGE method proposed recently by the author.Results Significant changes in promoter methylation were associated with miRNA targeting. It was also found that miRNA-targeted-gene promoter hypomethylation was related to differential target gene expression; the genes with miRNA-targeted-gene promoter hypomethylation were downregulated during cell senescence and upregulated during cellular differentiation.

Embryonal vasculature formation recapitulated in transgenic mammary tumor spheroids implanted pseudo-orthotopicly into mouse dorsal skin fold: the organoblasts concept', ['Halina Witkiewicz', 'Phil Oh', 'Jan E Schnitzer'], u'11 Jul 2013', u'Inadequate understanding of cancer biology is a problem. This work focused on cellular mechanisms of tumor vascularization. According to earlier studies, the tumor vasculature derives from host endothelial cells (angiogenesis) or their precursors of bone marrow origin circulating in the blood (neo-vasculogenesis) unlike in embryos. In this study, we observed the neo-vasculature form in multiple ways from local precursor cells. Recapitulation of primitive as well as advanced embryonal stages of vasculature formation followed co-implantation of avascular (in vitro cultured) N202 breast tumor spheroids and homologous tissue grafts into mouse dorsal skin chambers. Ultrastructural and immunocytochemical analysis of tissue sections exposed the interactions between the tumor and the graft tissue stem cells. It revealed details of vasculature morphogenesis not seen before in either tumors or embryos. A gradual increase in complexity of the vascular morphogenesis at the tumor site reflected a range of steps in ontogenic evolution of the differentiating cells. Malignant- and surgical injury repair-related tissue growth prompted local cells to initiate extramedullar erythropoiesis and vascular patterning. The new findings included: interdependence between the extramedullar hematopoiesis and assembly of new vessels (both from the locally differentiating precursors); nucleo-cytoplasmic conversion (karyolysis) as the mechanism of erythroblast enucleation; the role of megakaryocytes and platelets in vascular pattern formation before emergence of endothelial cells; lineage relationships between hematopoietic and endothelial cells; the role of extracellular calmyrin in tissue morphogenesis; and calmyrite, a new ultrastructural entity associated with anaerobic energy metabolism. The central role of the extramedullar erythropoiesis in the formation of new vasculature (blood and vessels) emerged here as part of the tissue building process including the lymphatic system and nerves, and suggests a cellular mechanism for instigating variable properties of endothelial surfaces in different organs. Those findings are consistent with the organoblasts concept, previously discussed in a study on childhood tumors, and have implications for tissue definition.', u'/articles/2-8/v2', ['Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology'], [u'Proteogenomics Research Institute for Systems Medicine, San Diego, CA, 92121, USA']]

The non-redundant dataset developed as part of this study is composed of 7339 entries representing unique Pfam/PDB-ligand (hetero group code) combinations with known levels of cognate ligand similarity. The query cavity can be uploaded by the user or detected automatically by the system using existing PDB entries as well as user-provided structures in PDB format. In all cases, the user can refine the definition of the cavity interactively via a browser-based Jmol 3D molecular visualization interface. Furthermore, users can restrict the search to a subset of the dataset using a cognate-similarity threshold. Local structural similarities are detected using the IsoCleft software and ranked according to two criteria (number of atoms in common and Tanimoto score of local structural similarity) and the associated Z-score and p-value measures of statistical significance. The results, including predicted ligands, target proteins, similarity scores, number of atoms in common, etc., are shown in a powerful interactive graphical interface. This interface permits the visualization of target ligands superimposed on the query cavity and additionally provides a table of pairwise ligand topological similarities.

[u'II. Capsular vaso-mimicry formed by transgenic mammary tumor spheroids implanted ectopically into mouse dorsal skin fold: implications for cellular mechanisms of metastasis', ['Halina Witkiewicz', 'Phil Oh', 'Jan E Schnitzer'], u'23 Apr 2013', u'Most cancer patients die of metastatic disease, not primary tumors, while biological mechanisms leading to metastases remain unclear and effective therapies are missing. Using a mouse dorsal skin chamber model we had observed that tumor growth and vasculature formation could be influenced by the way in vitro cultured (avascular) spheroids of N202 breast tumor cells were implanted; co-implantation of lactating breast tissue created stimulating microenvironment, whereas the absence of the graft resulted in temporary tumor dormancy. This report addressed the issue of cellular mechanisms of the vasculogenic switch that ended the dormancy. In situ ultrastructural analysis revealed that the tumors survived in ectopic microenvironment until some of host and tumor stem cells evolved independently into cells initiating the vasculogenic switch. The tumor cells that survived and proliferated under hypoxic conditions for three weeks were supported by erythrogenic autophagy of others. However, the host microenvironment first responded as it would to non-immunogenic foreign bodies, i.e., by encapsulating the tumor spheroids with collagen-producing fibroblasts. That led to a form of vaso-mimicry consisting of tumor cells amid tumor-derived erythrosomes (synonym of erythrocytes), megakaryocytes and platelets, and encapsulating them all, the host fibroblasts. Such capsular vaso-mimicry could potentially facilitate metastasis by fusing with morphologically similar lymphatic vessels or veins. Once incorporated into the host circulatory system, tumor cells could be carried away passively by blood flow, regardless of their genetic heterogeneity. The fake vascular segment would have permeability properties different from genuine vascular endothelium. The capsular vaso-mimicry was different from vasculogenic mimicry earlier observed in metastases-associated malignant tumors where channels formed by tumor cells were said to contain circulating blood. Structures similar to the vasculogenic mimicry were seen here as well but contained non-circulating erythrosomes formed between tumor nodules. The host\u2019s response to the implantation included coordinated formation of new vessels and peripheral nerves.', u'/articles/2-9/v2', ['Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology'], [u'Proteogenomics Research Institute for Systems Medicine, San Diego, CA, 92121, USA']]
[u'Self-organization of signal transduction', ['Gabriele Scheler'], u'23 Apr 2013', u'We propose a model of parameter learning for signal transduction, where the objective function is defined by signal transmission efficiency. We apply this to learn kinetic rates as a form of evolutionary learning, and look for parameters which satisfy the objective. This is a novel approach compared to the usual technique of adjusting parameters only on the basis of experimental data. The resulting model is self-organizing, i.e. perturbations in protein concentrations or changes in extracellular signaling will automatically lead to adaptation. We systematically perturb protein concentrations and observe the response of the system. We find compensatory or co-regulation of protein expression levels. In a novel experiment, we alter the distribution of extracellular signaling, and observe adaptation based on optimizing signal transmission. We also discuss the relationship between signaling with and without transients. Signaling by transients may involve maximization of signal transmission efficiency for the peak response, but a minimization in steady-state responses. With an appropriate objective function, this can also be achieved by concentration adjustment. Self-organizing systems may be predictive of unwanted drug interference effects, since they aim to mimic complex cellular adaptation in a unified way.', u'/articles/2-116/v1', ['Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'Carl Correns Foundation for Mathematical Biology, Mountain View, CA , 94040, USA']]

Since then, this discovery has offered us and other groups a powerful tool to characterize insoluble proteins, and we have further addressed several fundamental and disease-relevant issues associated with this discovery. Here I review these results, which are conceptualized into several novel scenarios. 1) Unlike 'misfolded proteins', which still retain the capacity to fold into well-defined structures but are misled to 'off-pathway' aggregation, unrefoldable and insoluble proteins completely lack this ability and will unavoidably aggregate in vivo with ~150 mM ions, thus designated as 'intrinsically insoluble proteins (IIPs)' here. IIPs may largely account for the 'wastefully synthesized' DRiPs identified in human cells. 2) The fact that IIPs including membrane proteins are all soluble in unsalted water, but get aggregated upon being exposed to ions, logically suggests that ions existing in the background play a central role in mediating protein aggregation, thus acting as 'dark mediators'. Our study with 14 salts confirms that IIPs lack the capacity to fold into any well-defined structures. We uncover that salts modulate protein dynamics and anions bind proteins with high selectivity and affinity, which is surprisingly masked by pre-existing ions. Accordingly, I modified my previous model. 3) Insoluble proteins interact with lipids to different degrees. Remarkably, an ALS-causing P56S mutation transforms the \u03b2-sandwich MSP domain into a helical integral membrane protein. Consequently, the number of membrane-interacting proteins might be much larger than currently recognized. To attack biological membranes may represent a common mechanism by which aggregated proteins initiate human diseases. 4) Our discovery also implies a solution to the 'chicken-and-egg paradox' for the origin of primitive membranes embedded with integral membrane proteins, if proteins originally emerged in unsalted prebiotic media.", u'/articles/2-94/v1', ['Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'Department of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Science, National University of Singapore, Singapore, 119260, Singapore', u'Department of Biochemistry, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, 119260, Singapore']]

Previous studies have shown that XprG controls the production of extracellular proteases in response to starvation.

Our microarray data showed that the expression of a large number of genes, including genes involved in secondary metabolism, development, high-affinity glucose uptake and autolysis, were altered in an xprG\u0394 null mutant. Many of these genes are known to be regulated in response to carbon starvation. We confirmed that sterigmatocystin and penicillin production is reduced in xprG- mutants.

[u'The stabilizing effects of genetic diversity on predator-prey dynamics', ['Christopher F Steiner', 'Jordan Masse'], u'12 Feb 2013', u'Heterogeneity among prey in their susceptibility to predation is a potentially important stabilizer of predator-prey interactions, reducing the magnitude of population oscillations and enhancing total prey population abundance. When microevolutionary responses of prey populations occur at time scales comparable to population dynamics, adaptive responses in prey defense can, in theory, stabilize predator-prey dynamics and reduce top-down effects on prey abundance. While experiments have tested these predictions, less explored are the consequences of the evolution of prey phenotypes that can persist in both vulnerable and invulnerable classes. We tested this experimentally using a laboratory aquatic system composed of the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus as a predator and the prey Synura petersenii, a colony-forming alga that exhibits genetic variation in its propensity to form colonies and colony size (larger colonies are a defense against predators). Prey populations of either low initial genetic diversity and low adaptive capacity or high initial genetic diversity and high adaptive capacity were crossed with predator presence and absence. Dynamics measured over the last 127 days of the 167-day experiment revealed no effects of initial prey genetic diversity on the average abundance or temporal variability of predator populations. However, genetic diversity and predator presence/absence interactively affected prey population abundance and stability; diversity of prey had no effects in the absence of predators but stabilized dynamics and increased total prey abundance in the presence of predators. The size structure of the genetically diverse prey populations diverged from single strain populations in the presence of predators, showing increases in colony size and in the relative abundance of cells found in colonies. Our work sheds light on the adaptive value of colony formation and supports the general view that genetic diversity and intraspecific trait variation of prey can play a vital role in the short-term dynamics and stability of planktonic predator-prey systems.', u'/articles/2-43/v1', ['Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Plant Biology, Ecology & Environmental Sciences'], [u'Department of Biological Sciences, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, 48202, USA']]

[u'III. Cellular ultrastructures in situ as key to understanding tumor energy metabolism: biological significance of the Warburg effect', ['Halina Witkiewicz', 'Phil Oh', 'Jan E Schnitzer'], u'10 Jan 2013', u'Despite the universality of metabolic pathways, malignant cells were found to have their metabolism reprogrammed to generate energy by glycolysis even under normal oxygen concentrations (the Warburg effect). Therefore, the pathway energetically 18 times less efficient than oxidative phosphorylation was implicated to match increased energy requirements of growing tumors. The paradox was explained by an abnormally high rate of glucose uptake, assuming unlimited availability of substrates for tumor growth in vivo. However, ultrastructural analysis of tumor vasculature morphogenesis showed that the growing tissue regions did not have continuous blood supply and intermittently depended on autophagy for survival. Erythrogenic autophagy, and resulting ATP generation by glycolysis, appeared critical to initiating vasculature formation where it was missing. This study focused on ultrastructural features that reflected metabolic switch from aerobic to anaerobic. Morphological differences between and within different types of cells were evident in tissue sections. In cells undergoing nucleo-cytoplasmic conversion into erythrosomes (erythrogenesis), gradual changes led to replacing mitochondria with peroxisomes, through an intermediate form connected to endoplasmic reticulum. Those findings related to the issue of peroxisome biogenesis and to the phenomenon of hemogenic endothelium. Mitochondria were compacted also during mitosis. In vivo, cells that lost and others that retained capability to use oxygen coexisted side-by-side; both types were important for vasculature morphogenesis and tissue growth. Once passable, the new vasculature segment could deliver external oxygen and nutrients. Nutritional and redox status of microenvironment had similar effect on metabolism of malignant and non-malignant cells demonstrating the necessity to maintain structure-energy equivalence in all living cells. The role of glycolysis in initiating vasculature formation, and in progression of cell cycle through mitosis, indicated that Warburg effect had a fundamental biological significance extending to non-malignant tissues. The approach used here could facilitate integration of accumulated cyber knowledge on cancer metabolism into predictive science.', u'/articles/2-10/v1', ['Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology'], [u'Proteogenomics Research Institute for Systems Medicine, San Diego, California, 92121, USA']]
[u'Considerations for clinical read alignment and mutational profiling using next-generation sequencing', ['Gavin R Oliver'], u'20 Sep 2012', u'Next-generation sequencing technologies are increasingly being applied in clinical settings, however the data are characterized by a range of platform-specific artifacts making downstream analysis problematic and error- prone. One major application of NGS is in the profiling of clinically relevant mutations whereby sequences are aligned to a reference genome and potential mutations assessed and scored. Accurate sequence alignment is pivotal in reliable assessment of potential mutations however selection of appropriate alignment tools is a non-trivial task complicated by the availability of multiple solutions each with its own performance characteristics. Using targeted analysis of BRCA1 as an example, we have simulated and mutated a test dataset based on Illumina sequencing technology.

The development of computational approaches to determine gene function is a major strand of computational genomics research. However, progress beyond using BLAST to transfer annotations has been surprisingly slow. We have previously argued that a large part of the reported success in using "guilt by association" in network data is due to the tendency of methods to simply assign new functions to already well-annotated genes. While such predictions will tend to be correct, they are generic; it is true, but not very helpful, that a gene with many functions is more likely to have any function. We have also presented evidence that much of the remaining performance in cross-validation cannot be usefully generalized to new predictions, making progressive improvement in analysis difficult to engineer.

[u'Forest dynamics', ['Lee Frelich'], u'17 Feb 2016', u'Forest dynamics encompass changes in stand structure, species composition, and species interactions with disturbance and environment over a range of spatial and temporal scales. For convenience, spatial scale is defined as individual tree, neighborhood, stand, and landscape. Whether a given canopy-leveling disturbance will initiate a sequence of development in structure with little change in composition or initiate an episode of succession depends on a match or mismatch, respectively, with traits of the dominant tree species that allow the species to survive disturbance. When these match, certain species-disturbance type combinations lock in a pattern of stand and landscape dynamics that can persist for several generations of trees; thus, dominant tree species regulate, as well as respond to, disturbance. A complex interaction among tree species, neighborhood effects, disturbance type and severity, landform, and soils determines how stands of differing composition form and the mosaic of stands that compose the landscape. Neighborhood effects (e.g., serotinous seed rain, sprouting, shading, leaf-litter chemistry, and leaf-litter physical properties) operate at small spatial extents of the individual tree and its neighbors but play a central role in forest dynamics by contributing to patch formation at stand scales and dynamics of the entire landscape. Dominance by tree species with neutral to negative neighborhood effects leads to unstable landscape dynamics in disturbance-prone regions, wherein most stands are undergoing succession; stability can only occur under very low-severity disturbance regimes. Dominance by species with positive effects leads to stable landscape dynamics wherein only a small proportion of stands undergo succession at any one time. Positive neighborhood effects are common in temperate and boreal zones, whereas negative effects are more common in tropical climates. Landscapes with positive dynamics have alternate categories of dynamics stabilized by high-severity and low-severity disturbance regimes. Contrary to prevailing ecological theory, systems with positive neighborhood effects can have similar levels of compositional stability across tree, stand, and landscape scales. Neighborhood effect theory can help explain responses of landscapes to large-scale land clearing and novel effects brought on by factors such as invasive species and deer overabundance.', u'/articles/5-183/v1', ['Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology', 'Plant Biology, Ecology & Environmental Sciences'], [u'University of Minnesota Center for Forest Ecology, St. Paul, Minnesota, 55108, USA']]

[u'Reconciling Techno-simplicity and Eco-complexity for future food security', ['Santiago L. Poggio', 'Sarina Macfadyen', 'David A. Bohan'], u'23 Dec 2015', u'Ecological intensification has been proposed as a paradigm for ensuring global food security while preserving biodiversity and ecosystem integrity. Ecological intensification was originally coined to promote precise site-specific farming practices aimed at reducing yield gaps, while avoiding negative environmental impacts (techno-simplicity). Recently, it has been extended to stress the importance of landscape complexity to preserve biodiversity and ecosystem services (eco-complexity). While these perspectives on ecological intensification may seem distinct, they are not incompatible and should be interwoven to create more comprehensive and practical solutions. Here, we argue that designing cropping systems to be more diverse, across space and time would be an effective route to accomplish environmentally-friendly intensification of crop production. Such a novel approach will require better integration of knowledge at the landscape level for increasing agro-biodiversity (focused on interventions outside fields) with strategies diversifying cropping systems to manage weeds and pests (focused on interventions inside fields).', u'/articles/4-1507/v1', ['Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology', 'Plant Biology, Ecology & Environmental Sciences'], [u'IFEVA/C\xe1tedra de Producci\xf3n Vegetal, Facultad de Agronom\xeda, Universidad de Buenos Aires/CONICET, Av.

Herein, we explore the survey data gathered from 2004 to 2011 in order to establish a benchmark understanding of our waterfowl communities and to establish a statistical framework for future environmental monitoring. The abundance and diversity of wintering waterfowl were relatively stable during the initial years of this survey, except in 2010 when there was a large spike in abundance and a reciprocal fall in diversity. There was no significant change in ranked abundance of most waterfowl species, with only Bufflehead (Bucephala albeola) and Hooded Merganser (Lophodytes cucllatus) showing a slight yet significant upward trend during the course of our survey period. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) was used to examine the community structure of wintering waterfowl. The results of the NMDS indicate that there is a spatial structure to the waterfowl communities of Narragansett Bay and this structure has remained relatively stable since the survey began. Our NMDS analysis helps to solidify what is known anecdotally about the bay\u2019s waterfowl ecology, and provides a formalized benchmark for long-term monitoring of Narragansett Bay\u2019s waterfowl communities. Birds, including waterfowl, are preferred bioindicators and we propose using our multivariate approach to monitor the future health of the bay.

Apart from the role of miRNAs in normal physiology, their dysregulation is implicated in a vast array of diseases. Dissection of miRNA-related associations are valuable for contemplating their mechanism in diseases, leading to the discovery of novel miRNAs for disease prognosis, diagnosis, and therapy.Motivation: Apart from databases and prediction tools, miRNA-related information is largely available as unstructured text. Manual retrieval of these associations can be labor-intensive due to steadily growing number of publications. Additionally, most of the published miRNA entity recognition methods are keyword based, further subjected to manual inspection for retrieval of relations. Despite the fact that several databases host miRNA-associations derived from text, lower sensitivity\xa0and lack of published details for miRNA entity recognition and associated relations identification has motivated the need for developing comprehensive methods that are freely available for the scientific community. Additionally, the lack of a standard corpus for miRNA-relations has caused difficulty in evaluating the available systems.We propose methods to automatically extract mentions of miRNAs, species, genes/proteins, disease, and relations from scientific literature. Our generated corpora, along with dictionaries, and miRNA regular expression are freely available for academic purposes. To our knowledge, these resources are the most comprehensive developed so far.Results: The identification of specific miRNA mentions reaches a recall of 0.94 and precision of 0.93.\xa0 Extraction of miRNA-disease and miRNA-gene relations lead to an F1 score of up to 0.76. A comparison of the information extracted by our approach to the databases miR2Disease and miRSel for the extraction of Alzheimer's disease related relations shows the capability of our proposed methods in identifying correct relations with improved sensitivity. The published resources and described methods can help the researchers for maximal retrieval of miRNA-relations and generation of miRNA-regulatory networks.Availability: The training and test corpora, annotation guidelines, developed dictionaries, and supplementary files are available at http://www.scai.fraunhofer.de/mirna-corpora.html", u'/articles/3-205/v3', ['Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'Fraunhofer SCAI, Bioinformatics, Schloss Birlinghoven, 53754, Sankt Augustin, Germany', u'University of Bonn, B-IT, Dahlmannstr. 2, 53113 Bonn, Germany', u'Hasso Plattner Institute Potsdam, Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-Str. 2-3, 14482 Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany', u'Semantic Computing Group, CIT-EC, Bielefeld University, 33615 Bielefeld, Germany']]

[u'Promiscuity progression of bioactive compounds over time', ['Ye Hu', 'Swarit Jasial', 'Jurgen Bajorath'], u'15 Jun 2015', u'In the context of polypharmacology, compound promiscuity is rationalized as the ability of small molecules to specifically interact with multiple targets. To study promiscuity progression of bioactive compounds in detail, nearly 1 million compounds and more than 5.2 million activity records were analyzed. Compound sets were assembled by applying different data confidence criteria and selecting compounds with activity histories over many years. On the basis of publication dates, compounds and activity records were organized on a time course, which ultimately enabled monitoring data growth and promiscuity progression over nearly 40 years, beginning in 1976. Surprisingly low degrees of promiscuity were consistently detected for all compound sets and there were only small increases in promiscuity over time. In fact, most compounds had a constant degree of promiscuity, including compounds with an activity history of 10 or 20 years. Moreover, during periods of massive data growth, beginning in 2007, promiscuity degrees also remained constant or displayed only minor increases, depending on the activity data confidence levels. Considering high-confidence data, bioactive compounds currently interact with 1.5 targets on average, regardless of their origins, and display essentially constant degrees of promiscuity over time. Taken together, our findings provide expectation values for promiscuity progression and magnitudes among bioactive compounds as activity data further grow.', u'/articles/4-118/v2', ['Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'Department of Life Science Informatics, B-IT, LIMES Program Unit Chemical Biology and Medicinal Chemistry, Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit\xe4t, Dahlmannstr. 2, Bonn, D-53113, Germany']]

In this work an algorithm of linking phenotypes to Gene Ontology (GO) annotations is outlined, which does not require training genes and is based on algorithmic principles of Genes to Diseases (G2D) gene prioritization tool. In the outlined algorithm phenotypes are defined by terms of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). GO annotations are linked to phenotypes through intermediate MeSH D terms of drugs and chemicals. This inference uses mathematical framework of fuzzy binary relationships based on fuzzy set theory. Strength of relationships between the terms is defined through frequency of co-occurrences of the pairs of terms in PubMed articles and a frequency of association between GO annotations and MeSH D terms in NCBI Gene gene2go and gene2pubmed datasets.

These models make it possible to apply the well-known theory and tools of Markov chains to GRN analysis. A new kind of finite interaction graph called a combinatorial net is introduced to represent formally a GRN and its transition graphs constructed from interaction graphs. The system dynamics are defined as a random walk on the transition graph, which is a Markov chain. A novel concurrent updating scheme (evolution rule) is developed to determine transitions in a transition graph. The proposed scheme is based on the firing of a random set of non-steady-state vertices in a combinatorial net. It is demonstrated that this novel scheme represents an advance in asynchronicity modeling. The theorem that combinatorial nets with this updating scheme can asynchronously compute a maximal independent set of graphs is also proved.

Dandekar'], u'10 Sep 2014', u'The remarkable diversity in biological systems is rooted in the ability of the twenty naturally occurring amino acids to perform multifarious catalytic functions by creating unique structural scaffolds known as the active site. Finding such structrual motifs within the protein structure is a key aspect of many computational methods. The algorithm for obtaining combinations of motifs of a certain length, although polynomial in complexity, runs in non-trivial computer time. Also, the search space expands considerably if stereochemically equivalent residues are allowed to replace an amino acid in the motif. In the present work, we propose a method to precompile all possible motifs comprising of a set (n=4 in this case) of predefined amino acid residues from a protein structure that occur within a specified distance (R) of each other (PREMONITION). PREMONITION rolls a sphere of radius R along the protein fold centered at the C atom of each residue, and all possible motifs are extracted within this sphere. The number of residues that can occur within a sphere centered around a residue is bounded by physical constraints, thus setting an upper limit on the processing times. After such a pre-compilation step, the computational time required for querying a protein structure with multiple motifs is considerably reduced. Previously, we had proposed a computational method to estimate the promiscuity of proteins with known active site residues and 3D structure using a database of known active sites in proteins (CSA) by querying each protein with the active site motif of every other residue. The runtimes for such a comparison is reduced from days to hours using the PREMONITION methodology.', u'/articles/3-217/v1', ['Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'Plant Sciences Department, University of California, Davis, CA, 95616, USA', u'Department of Biological Sciences, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Homi Bhabha Road, Mumbai, 400 005, India', u'Science Institute, Department of Biochemistry, University of Iceland, Dunhaga 3, IS-107 Reykjavik, Iceland', u'Department of Chemical Sciences, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Homi Bhabha Road, Mumbai, 400 005, India']]

We have devised strategies to employ a structural regime to search sequence space with good specificity and sensitivity. We employ two well-known sequence search methods, PSI-BLAST and PHI-BLAST, with multiple queries and multiple patterns to enhance homologue identification at the structural superfamily level.

It is designed for interactive, iterative manipulation of the model code, handling of multiple data sets and parameter sets, and for making comparisons among different models running simultaneously or separately. Interactive use is supported by a large collection of graphical user interfaces for model writing and compilation diagnostics, defining input functions, model runs, selection of algorithms solving ordinary and partial differential equations, run-time multidimensional graphics, parameter optimization (8 methods), sensitivity analysis, and Monte Carlo simulation for defining confidence ranges. JSim uses Mathematical Modeling Language (MML) a declarative syntax specifying algebraic and differential equations. Imperative constructs written in other languages (MATLAB, FORTRAN, C++, etc.) are accessed through procedure calls. MML syntax is simple, basically defining the parameters and variables, then writing the equations in a straightforward, easily read and understood mathematical form. This makes JSim good for teaching modeling as well as for model analysis for research.\xa0\xa0 For high throughput applications, JSim can be run as a batch job.\xa0 JSim can automatically translate models from the repositories for Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) and CellML models. Stochastic modeling is supported. MML supports assigning physical units to constants and variables and automates checking dimensional balance as the first step in verification testing. Automatic unit scaling follows, e.g. seconds to minutes, if needed. The JSim Project File sets a standard for reproducible modeling analysis: it includes in one file everything for analyzing a set of experiments: the data, the models, the data fitting, and evaluation of parameter confidence ranges.

[u'Mutation extraction tools can be combined for robust recognition of genetic variants in the literature', ['Antonio  Jimeno Yepes', 'Karin Verspoor'], u'10 Jun 2014', u'As the cost of genomic sequencing continues to fall, the amount of data being collected and studied for the purpose of understanding the genetic basis of disease is increasing dramatically. Much of the source information relevant to such efforts is available only from unstructured sources such as the scientific literature, and significant resources are expended in manually curating and structuring the information in the literature. As such, there have been a number of systems developed to target automatic extraction of mutations and other genetic variation from the literature using text mining tools. We have performed a broad survey of the existing publicly available tools for extraction of genetic variants from the scientific literature. We consider not just one tool but a number of different tools, individually and in combination, and apply the tools in two scenarios. First, they are compared in an intrinsic evaluation context, where the tools are tested for their ability to identify specific mentions of genetic variants in a corpus of manually annotated papers, the Variome corpus. Second, they are compared in an extrinsic evaluation context based on our previous study of text mining support for curation of the COSMIC and InSiGHT databases. Our results demonstrate that no single tool covers the full range of genetic variants mentioned in the literature. Rather, several tools have complementary coverage and can be used together effectively. In the intrinsic evaluation on the Variome corpus, the combined performance is above 0.95 in F-measure, while in the extrinsic evaluation the combined recall performance is above 0.71 for COSMIC and above 0.62 for InSiGHT, a substantial improvement over the performance of any individual tool. Based on the analysis of these results, we suggest several directions for the improvement of text mining tools for genetic variant extraction from the literature.', u'/articles/3-18/v2', ['Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'National ICT Australia, Victoria Research Laboratory, Melbourne, Australia', u'Department of Computing and Information Systems, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia']]

Additionally, techniques such as multiplex sequencing allow one run to contain hundreds of different samples. With such data comes a significant challenge to understand its quality and to understand how the quality and yield are changing across instruments and over time. As well as the desire to understand historical data, sequencing centres often have a duty to provide clear summaries of individual run performance to collaborators or customers. We present StatsDB, an open-source software package for storage and analysis of next generation sequencing run metrics. The system has been designed for incorporation into a primary analysis pipeline, either at the programmatic level or via integration into existing user interfaces. Statistics are stored in an SQL database and APIs provide the ability to store and access the data while abstracting the underlying database design. This abstraction allows simpler, wider querying across multiple fields than is possible by the manual steps and calculation required to dissect individual reports, e.g. \u201dprovide metrics about nucleotide bias in libraries using adaptor barcode X, across all runs on sequencer A, within the last month\u201d. The software is supplied with modules for storage of statistics from FastQC, a commonly used tool for analysis of sequence reads, but the open nature of the database schema means it can be easily adapted to other tools.

Interestingly, recent studies in Arabidopsis and rice show that this thermo-priming lasts for several days at normal growth temperatures and that it is an active process that is genetically separable from the priming itself. This is referred to as maintenance of acquired thermotolerance or heat stress memory. Such a memory conceivably has adaptive advantages under natural conditions, where heat stress often is chronic or recurring.

This contrasts with a lag in initiatives for their management and a lack of studies about their biology, ecology and fishery. We investigated the dynamics of Peruvian shark fishery and its legal framework identifying information gaps for recommending actions to improve management. Further, we investigated the importance of the Peruvian shark fishery from a regional perspective. From 1950 to 2010, 372,015 tons of sharks were landed in Peru. From 1950 to 1969, we detected a significant increase in landings; but from 2000 to 2011 there was a significant decrease in landings, estimated at 3.5% per year. Six species represented 94% of landings: blue shark (Prionace glauca), shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus), smooth hammerhead (Sphyrna zygaena), common thresher (Alopias vulpinus), smooth-hound (Mustelus whitneyi) and angel shark (Squatina californica). Of these, the angel shark exhibits a strong and significant decrease in landings: 18.9% per year from 2000 to 2010. Peru reports the highest accumulated historical landings in the Pacific Ocean; but its contribution to annual landings has decreased since 1968. Still, Peru is among the top 12 countries exporting shark fins to the Hong Kong market. Although the government collects total weight by species, the number of specimens landed as well as population parameters (e.g. sex, size and weight) are not reported. Further, for some genera, species-level identification is deficient and so overestimates the biomass landed by species and underestimates the species diversity.

The present study seeks to shed light on the composition of fungal communities on FPOM and CPOM as assessed in a natural stream in Nova Scotia, Canada. Maple leaves were exposed in a stream for four weeks and their fungal community evaluated through pyrosequencing. Over the same period, four FPOM size fractions were collected by filtration and assessed. Particles had much lower ergosterol contents than leaves, suggesting major differences in the extent of fungal colonization. Pyrosequencing documented a total of 821 fungal operational taxonomic units (OTU), of which 726 were exclusive to particles and 47 to leaf samples. Most fungal phyla were represented, including yeast lineages (e.g., Taphrinaceae and Saccharomycotina), Basidiomycota, Chytridiomycota and Cryptomycota, but several classes of Pezizomycontina (Ascomycota) dominated.

The discovery that other Hb-like proteins existed in plants led to the term \u201cnonsymbiotic Hbs (nsHbs)\u201d to differentiate them from the Lbs. While this terminology was adequate in the early stages of research on the protein, the complexity of the research in this area necessitates a change in the definition of these proteins to delineate them from red blood cell Hb. At the 2014 XVIII Conference on Oxygen-Binding and Sensing Proteins, the group devoted to the study of heme-containing proteins, this issue was discussed and a consensus was reached on a proposed name change. We propose Phytoglobin (Phytogb) as a logical, descriptive name to describe a heme-containing (Hb-like) protein found in plants.

The pattern of guarding and the way by which one sentinel replaces another reflect the dominance relationships within the group. The dominant (alpha) male guarded more than any other individual. It interfered with and replaced the guarding by the adult beta male more than it did with the yearlings. About one-third of the replacements occurred less than one minute after the sentinel had assumed guarding. Whereas the dominant often replaced its subordinates directly; subordinates hardly ever replaced their dominants directly. The alpha male often allofed the beta male during the replacement. Replacements and allofeeding of the beta males by the alpha males increased significantly during courtship, when competition over breeding was maximal, and dropped back to their previous level at the start of incubation, highlighting the competitive basis underlying the act of guarding. Competition over altruistic acts, as shown here for guarding, is not compatible with explanations based on the assumption that altruistic acts reduce the fitness (reproductive success) of the altruist. We suggest, in contrast, that by investing in guarding and by intervening in the guarding of its competitors, a babbler demonstrates and signals its quality and its control over its competitors, thereby increasing its prestige and consequently its direct fitness.', u'/articles/4-618/v2', ['Plant Biology, Ecology & Environmental Sciences'], [u'Free environmental education in Nicaragua, SONATI, Le\xf3n, Nicaragua', u'Department of Zoology, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel', u'ARO The Vulcani Center, Bet-Dagan, Israel']]

[u'The manufacture of filtered cannabis cigarettes: uniform particle distribution and combustion properties for consistent cannabinoid delivery', ['Jason A. Cranford', 'Donald C.

Unlike production of filtered tobacco cigarettes, standardization in the manufacture of cannabinoid containing cigarettes is lacking. The numerous cannabis strains with variable cannabinoid content, differences in cultivation methods and variability in assembly associated with hand-rolled cannabis cigarettes makes consistent cannabinoid inhalation dosing challenging. To address the growing need for standardization in the manufacture of cannabis cigarettes we developed a process for the production of filtered CN using machine-rolled tobacco cigarette equipment. The processed CN packing density, particle size distribution and curing procedures were designed to produce filtered CN that were identical in appearance and qualitatively similar in combustion properties to market-leading filtered commercial tobacco cigarettes. Quality control procedures were implemented to assure consistency in the manufacturing process and minimize variability associated with cigarette production such as inconsistencies in packing density, particle size, and combustion rate of mainstream smoke. Passive inverted smoldering assessment indicated that CN cigarettes burned at a faster rate compared to commercial filtered tobacco cigarettes of similar density. Overall, it is expected that machine-rolled standardized cannabis cigarettes with control over filler particle sizes, packing density and smoldering rates will contribute to making inhalation dosing of cannabis cigarettes more effective for therapeutic use.', u'/articles/4-1466/v1', ['Plant Biology, Ecology & Environmental Sciences', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'Cranfords LLC, Boulder, CO, USA', u'Mobile Assay LLC, Boulder, CO, USA']]

We conducted a case-study on the economic impact of different MPA network design strategies on the Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) fisheries in Canada. The open-source R toolbox that we developed to analyze this case study can be customized to conduct similar analyses for other systems. We used a spatially-explicit individual-based model of population growth and dispersal coupled with a fisheries management and harvesting component. We found that MPA networks that both protect the target species\u2019 habitat (particularly the spawning grounds), and were spatially optimized to improve population connectivity had the highest net present value (i.e., were most profitable for the fishing industry). These higher profits were achieved primarily by reducing the distance travelled for fishing and reducing the probability of a moratorium event. These findings add to a growing body of knowledge demonstrating the importance of incorporating population connectivity in the MPA planning process, as well as the ability of this R toolbox to explore ecological and economic consequences of alternative MPA network designs.', u'/articles/4-1234/v1', ['Plant Biology, Ecology & Environmental Sciences'], [u'Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, M5S 3B2, Canada', u'Department of Zoology and Entomology, Rhodes University, Grahamstown, 6140, South Africa', u'National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory, Ann Arbor, Michigan, 48108, USA']]

However, the contradiction between the embryo-lethal phenotypes of the originally described Arabidopsis T-DNA insertional knock-out alleles (abp1-1 and abp1-1s) and the wild type-like phenotypes of other recently described loss-of-function alleles (abp1-c1 and abp1-TD1) questions the biological importance of ABP1 and relevance of the previous genetic studies. Here we show that there is no hidden copy of the ABP1 gene in the Arabidopsis genome but the embryo-lethal phenotypes of abp1-1 and abp1-1s alleles are very similar to the knock-out phenotypes of the neighboring gene, BELAYA SMERT (BSM). Furthermore, the allelic complementation test between bsm and abp1 alleles shows that the embryo-lethality in the abp1-1 and abp1-1s alleles is caused by the off-target disruption of the BSM locus by the T-DNA insertions.

Bach'], u'12 Aug 2015', u'In a preceding study we have recently established an in vivo visualization system for the geranylgeranylation of proteins in a stably transformed tobacco BY-2 cell line, which involves expressing a dexamethasone-inducible GFP fused to the prenylable, carboxy-terminal basic domain of the rice calmodulin CaM61, which naturally bears a CaaL geranylgeranylation motif (GFP-BD-CVIL). By using pathway-specific inhibitors it was there demonstrated that inhibition of the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway with oxoclomazone and fosmidomycin, as well as inhibition of protein geranylgeranyl transferase type 1 (PGGT-1), shifted the localization of the GFP-BD-CVIL protein from the membrane to the nucleus. In contrast, the inhibition of the mevalonate (MVA) pathway with mevinolin did not affect this localization. Furthermore, in this initial study complementation assays with pathway-specific intermediates confirmed that the precursors for the cytosolic isoprenylation of this fusion protein are predominantly provided by the MEP pathway. In order to optimize this visualization system from a more qualitative assay to a statistically trustable medium or a high-throughput screening system, we established now new conditions that permit culture and analysis in 96-well microtiter plates, followed by fluorescence microscopy. For further refinement, the existing GFP-BD-CVIL cell line was transformed with an estradiol-inducible vector driving the expression of a RFP protein, C-terminally fused to a nuclear localization signal (NLS-RFP). We are thus able to quantify the total number of viable cells versus the number of inhibited cells after various treatments. This approach also includes a semi-automatic counting system, based on the freely available image processing software. As a result, the time of image analysis as well as the risk of user-generated bias is reduced to a minimum.

The effect of two factors, rice variety (Edeget, X-jigna and Nerica-4) and blending proportions of rice and teff (0.5:0.5, 0.7:0.3 and 0.9:0.1) were studied. The data analysis was conducted using SAS software package for the mean comparison and custom design by JMP 8 software. Response surface methodology was applied to study the interaction effect of the main factors and to generate the predictive equations. An optimal value (1.60%) of fiber was obtained when the proportion of the blend was 50% Edeget and 50% teff because teff grain is high in fiber. A maximum value (10.75%) of protein was obtained when the proportion of the blend was 70% Nerica-4 and 30% teff. Carbohydrate was optimal (81.37%) when 90% Edeget and 10% teff were blended because rice grain is high in carbohydrate. Optimal iron content (12.97 mg/100g) was obtained when the proportion of the blend was 50% Nerica-4 and 50% teff because teff grain is high in iron. Optimal zinc content (4.14 mg/100g) was obtained when the proportion of the blend was 50% X-jigna and 50% teff.

The objectives of this study are to 1) determine medium pH change over time in storage conditions and with presence of explants, 2) evaluate the effects of medium pH change on explant growth performance and 3) assess the effects of adding a pH stabilizer, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) that is commonly used in Douglas-fir micropropagation medium. Vegetative buds were collected in the spring before breaking dormancy from juvenile and mature donor trees for conducting these evaluations. Medium, with or without MES, was pre-adjusted to five pH levels before adding MES, agar and autoclaving. Medium pH changes and explant growth parameters were measured at eight different incubation times. Overall, MES provided a more stable medium pH, relative to starting pH values, under both light and dark storage conditions as well as with presence of explants. A general trend of decreasing medium pH over time was found comparing explants from juvenile and mature donor genotypes. Explant height and weight growth increased over time, but differ among explants from juvenile and mature donor genotypes.

Target and distractors were presented in the ventral visual field, the dorsal field or both. Bees presented with targets in the ventral visual field consistently had the highest search efficiency, with rapid decisions, high accuracy and direct flight paths. In contrast, search performance for dorsally located targets was inaccurate and slow at the beginning of the experimental phase, but bees increased their search performance significantly after a few foraging bouts: they found the target faster, made fewer errors and flew in a straight line towards the target. However, bees needed thrice as long to improve the search for a dorsally located target when the target\u2019s position changed randomly between the ventral and the dorsal visual field.

While the mechanisms of invasive species establishment are well studied, the mechanisms driving abundance patterns (i.e. patterns of population density and population size) remain poorly understood. It is assumed that invasive species typically have higher abundances in their new environments than in their native ranges, and patterns of invasive species abundance differ between invaded regions. To explain differences in invasive species abundance, we propose the Human Release Hypothesis. In parallel to the established Enemy Release Hypothesis, this hypothesis states that the differences in abundance of invasive species are found between regions because population expansion is reduced in some regions through continuous land management and associated cutting of the invasive species. The Human Release Hypothesis does not negate other important drivers of species invasions, but rather should be considered as a potentially important complementary mechanism. We illustrate the hypothesis via a case study on an invasive rose species, and hypothesize which locations globally may be most likely to support high abundances of invasive species.

This review discusses the major findings from the current studies on rice Hbs. At the molecular level, a family of the nshb genes, consisting of hb1, hb2, hb3, hb4 and hb5, and a single copy of the thb gene exist in Oryza sativa var. indica and O. sativa var. japonica, Hb transcripts coexist in rice organs and Hb polypeptides exist in rice embryonic and vegetative organs and in the cytoplasm of differentiating cells. At the structural level, the crystal structure of rice Hb1 has been elucidated, and the structures of the other rice Hbs have been modeled. Kinetic analysis indicated that rice Hb1 and 2, and possibly rice Hb3 and 4, exhibit a very high affinity for O2, whereas rice Hb5 and tHb possibly exhibit a low to moderate affinity for O2. Based on the accumulated information on the properties of rice Hbs and data from the analysis of other plant and non-plant Hbs, it is likely that Hbs play a variety of roles in rice organs, including O2-transport, O2-sensing, NO-scavenging and redox-signaling. From an evolutionary perspective, an outline for the evolution of rice Hbs is available. Rice nshb and thb genes vertically evolved through different lineages, rice nsHbs evolved into clade I and clade II lineages and rice nshbs and thbs evolved under the effect of neutral selection. This review also reveals lacunae in our ability to completely understand rice Hbs.

How much value is at risk from high-impact invasive species, and which parameters determine variation in that value, constitutes critical knowledge for directing both management and research, but it is rarely available. We evaluated the value of the commercial shellfish harvest that is at risk in nearshore ecosystems of Puget Sound, Washington State, USA, from the invasive European green crab, Carcinus maenas. We assessed this value using a simple static ecological model combined with an economic model using data from Puget Sound\u2019s shellfish harvest and revenue and the relationship between C. maenas abundance and the consumption rate of shellfish. The model incorporates a range in C. maenas diet preference, calories consumed per year, and crab densities. C. maenas is likely to prey on commercially harvested hardshell clams, oysters, and mussels, which would likely reduce additional revenue from processing and distribution, and the number of jobs associated with these fisheries.The model results suggest possible revenue losses of these shellfish ranging from $1.03-23.8 million USD\xa0year-1 (2.8-64% losses), with additional processing and distribution losses up to $17.6 million USD and 442 job positions each year associated with a range of plausible parameter values. The broad range of values reflects the uncertainty in key factors underlying impacts, factors that are highly variable across invaded regions and so not knowable a priori. However, future research evaluating species invasions can reduce the uncertainty of impacts by characterizing several key parameters: density of individuals, number of arrivals, predation and competition interactions, and economic impacts.

[u'Ecological implications of reduced pollen supply in the alpine: a case study using a dominant cushion plant species', ['Anya Reid', 'Robyn Hooper', 'Olivia Molenda', 'Christopher J. Lortie'], u'07 Aug 2014', u'The reproductive assurance hypothesis states that self-incompatible female plants must produce twice the number of seeds relative to their self-compatible hermaphroditic counterparts to persist in gynodioecious populations. This is a viable life-history strategy, provided that pollination rates are sufficiently high. However, reduced pollination rates in alpine plants are likely due to climate induced plant-pollinator mismatches and general declines in pollinators. Using a gynodioecious population of the dominant plant Silene acaulis (Caryophyllaceae), we tested the reproductive assurance hypothesis and also the stress gradient hypothesis with a series of pollinator exclusion trials and extensive measurements of subsequent reproductive output (gender ratio, plant size, percent fruit-set, fruit weight, seeds per fruit, total seeds, seed weight, and seed germination). The reproductive assurance hypothesis was supported with female plants being more sensitive to and less likely to be viable under reductions in pollination rates. These findings are the first to show that the stress gradient hypothesis is also supported under a gradient of pollen supply instead of environmental limitations. Beneficiary abundance was negatively correlated to percent fruit-set under current pollen supply, but became positive under reduced pollen supply suggesting that there are important plant-plant-pollinator interactions related to reproduction in these alpine plant species.', u'/articles/3-130/v2', ['Plant Biology, Ecology & Environmental Sciences'], [u'Department of Forest and Conservation Sciences, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, V6T 1Z4, Canada', u'Department of Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry, University of Toronto, Toronto, M5S 3E5, Canada', u'Department of Biology, York University, Toronto, M3J 1P3, Canada']]
[u'Epiphyte response to drought and experimental warming in an Andean cloud forest', ['Joshua M. Rapp', 'Miles R. Silman'], u'06 Jun 2014', u'The high diversity and abundance of vascular epiphytes in tropical montane cloud forest is associated with frequent cloud immersion, which is thought to protect plants from drought stress. Increasing temperature and rising cloud bases associated with climate change may increase epiphyte drought stress, leading to species and biomass loss. We tested the hypothesis that warmer and drier conditions associated with a lifting cloud base will lead to increased mortality and/or decreased recruitment of epiphyte ramets, altering species composition in epiphyte mats. By using a reciprocal transplant design, where epiphyte mats were transplanted across an altitudinal gradient of increasing cloud immersion, we differentiated between the effects of warmer and drier conditions from the more general prediction of niche theory that transplanting epiphytes in any direction away from their home elevation should result in reduced performance. Effects differed among species, but effects were generally stronger and more negative for epiphytes in mats transplanted down slope from the highest elevation, into warmer and drier conditions, than for epiphyte mats transplanted from other elevations. In contrast, epiphytes from lower elevations showed greater resistance to drought in all treatments. Epiphyte community composition changed with elevation, but over the timescale of the experiment there were no consistent changes in species composition. Our results suggest some epiphytes may show resistance to climate change depending on the environmental and evolutionary context. In particular, sites where high rainfall makes cloud immersion less important for epiphyte water-balance, or where occasional drought has previously selected for drought-resistant taxa, may be less adversely affected by predicted climate changes.', u'/articles/3-7/v2', ['Plant Biology, Ecology & Environmental Sciences'], [u'Department of Biology, Wake Forest University, Winston Salem, NC, 27109, USA', u'Current address: Department of Biology, Tufts University, Medford, MA, 02155, USA']]

It forms part of the Eastern Arc Mountains and Coastal forest ecoregion which is a global biodiversity hotspot with considerable species endemism. Despite such conservation significance, the forest is undergoing rapid modification and habitat loss mainly from anthropogenic pressures, with negative impacts on sensitive species such as the Sokoke Pipit (Anthus sokokensis), one of the globally-endangered birds. The study examined impacts of habitat degradation on the species\u2019 population and spatial occurrence within three blocks of Brachystegia woodland in this forest. Over a three week period, six 1km transects were used to estimate the species\u2019 population in relation to major habitat quality variables. Sokoke Pipits occurred at an overall mean density of 0.72\xb10.15 birds/ha with an estimated population of 5,544 in the Brachystegia woodland. Tree logging intensity was the key cause of the degradation of the Sokoke Pipit\u2019s critical habitat, which affected its density (R2 = 0.663, \xdf = -0.814, p = 0.048). The species also preferred sites covered with deep floor litter (R2 = 0.769, \xdf = 0.877, p = 0.021) even in areas with low tree canopy height, but showed no clumped distribution (\u03c72(2, 0.05) = 2.061). The species generally occurred at very low densities in sites with intensive elephant activity that accelerated habitat modification by felling trees and opening the understorey. We conclude that although human-driven tree removal is a major driver of overall degradation of the Sokoke Pipit\u2019s critical habitat, elephant activity may be an important additional catalytic factor in this process. Long term conservation strategies for the species will require stricter control of logging.

In early April, significant amounts of drift ice reached the Atlantic coast of mainland Nova Scotia. The ice floes persisted in those coastal waters for up to 16 days, depending on the location. During that time, the ice fragments caused extensive physical disturbance in rocky intertidal communities, removing high quantities of seaweeds and invertebrates. For example, at a location where the ice stayed for 9 days, the loss of macroalgal and invertebrate biomass was almost total. At a location where the ice stayed for 4 days, losses were lower, albeit still high overall. Such a magnitude of disturbance is not common on this coast, as sea ice had not reached the surveyed locations in the previous 4\u20135 years. We suggest that the frequency of ice scour events may help to predict intertidal community structure.

These benefits and costs are mostly examined independently, rather than comparing the trade-offs of animal activity in the same system and quantifying the net return from beneficial minus detrimental activities. Here, I examine the net return associated with the activity of seed-eating birds in almond orchards by quantifying the economic costs and benefits of bird consumption of almonds. Pre-harvest, the consumption of harvestable almonds by birds cost growers AUD$57.50 ha-1 when averaged across the entire plantation. Post-harvest, the same bird species provide an ecosystem service by removing mummified nuts from trees that growers otherwise need to remove to reduce threats from fungal infection or insect pest infestations. The value of this ecosystem service ranged from AUD$82.50 ha-1\u2013$332.50 ha-1 based on the replacement costs of mechanical or manual removal of mummified nuts, respectively. Hence, bird consumption of almonds yielded a positive net return of AUD$25\u2013$275 ha-1 averaged across the entire plantation. However, bird activity varied spatially resulting in positive net returns occurring primarily at the edges of crops where activity was higher, compared to negative net returns in crop interiors. Moreover, partial mummy nut removal by birds meant that bird activity may only reduce costs to growers rather than replace these costs completely. Similar cost-benefit trade-offs exist across nature, and quantifying net returns can better inform land management decisions such as when to control pests or promote ecosystem service provision.', u'/articles/2-239/v2', ['Plant Biology, Ecology & Environmental Sciences'], [u'Institute for Land, Water and Society, Charles Sturt University, Albury, 2640, Australia']]

[u'Thermoregulation strategies in ants in comparison to other social insects, with a focus on red wood ants (Formica rufa\xa0group)', ['Stepanka Kadochova', 'Jan Frouz'], u'21 Mar 2014', u'Temperature influences every aspect of ant biology, especially metabolic rate, growth and development. Maintenance of high inner nest temperature increases the rate of sexual brood development and thereby increases the colony fitness. Insect societies can achieve better thermoregulation than solitary insects due to the former\u2019s ability to build large and elaborated nests and display complex behaviour. In ants and termites the upper part of the nest, the mound, often works as a solar collector and can also have an efficient ventilation system. Two thermoregulatory strategies could be applied. Firstly the ants use an increased thermal gradient available in the mound for brood relocation. Nurse workers move the brood according to the thermal gradients to ensure the ideal conditions for development. A precise perception of temperature and evolution of temperature preferences are needed to make the correct choices. A second thermoregulatory strategy used by mound nesting ants is keeping a high temperature inside large nests. The unique thermal and insulation properties of the nest material help to maintain stable conditions, which is the case of the Wood ant genus Formica. Ants can regulate thermal loss by moving nest aggregation and alternating nest ventilation. Metabolic heat produced by ant workers or associated micro organisms is an important additional source of heat which helps to maintain thermal homeostasis in the nest.', u'/articles/2-280/v2', ['Plant Biology, Ecology & Environmental Sciences'], [u'Department of Ecology, Charles University, Prague, CZ12800, Czech Republic', u'Institute for Environmental Studies, Charles University, Prague, CZ12800, Czech Republic']]
[u'First regional evaluation of nuclear genetic diversity and population structure in northeastern coyotes (Canis latrans)', ['Javier Monzon'], u'03 Mar 2014', u'Previous genetic studies of eastern coyotes (Canis latrans) are based on one of two strategies: sampling many individuals using one or very few molecular markers, or sampling very few individuals using many genomic markers. Thus, a regional analysis of genetic diversity and population structure in eastern coyotes using many samples and several molecular markers is lacking. I evaluated genetic diversity and population structure in 385 northeastern coyotes using 16 common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A region-wide analysis of population structure revealed three primary genetic populations, but these do not correspond to the same three subdivisions inferred in a previous analysis of mitochondrial DNA sequences. More focused geographic analyses of population structure indicated that ample genetic structure occurs in coyotes from an intermediate contact zone where two range expansion fronts meet. These results demonstrate that genotyping several highly heterozygous SNPs in a large, geographically dense sample is an effective way to detect cryptic population genetic structure.

For individuals who do not have access to milk and dairy products, do not tolerate them, or prefer not to consume them, plants may be \xa0alternative sources of calcium.

Calcium content was analyzed in dry leaf powder by atomic absorption, followed by a two-stage in vitro digestion and dialysis against a mock serum solution to determine calcium digestibility and bioaccessibility. Moringa oleifera had higher calcium content than spinach and sweet potato leaves: 1.54\xb10.11% of dry matter for three Moringa samples (two African and one from India), and 0.99\xb10.001 and 1.06\xb10.001, respectively, in spinach and sweet potato leaves.

A dialysis system was designed to model bioaccessibility of calcium, revealing that bioaccessible calcium in sweet potato leaves was a non-significant 1.4 times higher and in Moringa was 9.2 to 19.4 times higher than in spinach. Therefore, the calcium contained in Moringa leaves does not appear to be associated with poorly bioavailable complexes such as oxalate.

However, bleaching patterns often show significant spatial variability, therefore identifying locations where local conditions may provide thermal refuges is a high conservation priority. Coral bleaching mortality often diminishes with increasing depth, but clear depth zonation of coral communities and putative limited overlap in species composition between deep and shallow reef habitats has led to the conclusion that deeper reef habitats will provide limited refuge from bleaching for most species. Here, we show that coral mortality following a severe bleaching event diminished sharply with depth. Bleaching-induced mortality of Acropora was approximately 90% at 0-2m, 60% at 3-4 m, yet at 6-8m there was negligible mortality. Importantly, at least two-thirds of the shallow-water (2-3 m) Acropora assemblage had a depth range that straddled the transition from high to low mortality. Cold-water upwelling may have contributed to the lower mortality observed in all but the shallowest depths. Our results demonstrate that, in this instance, depth provided a refuge for individuals from a high proportion of species in this Acropora-dominated assemblage.

Unfortunately, repeated efforts at heterologous expression of the castor fatty acid hydroxylase (RcFAH12) in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana have produced only 17-19% HFA in the seed triacylglycerols (TAG), whereas castor seeds accumulate up to 90% ricinoleic acid in the endosperm TAG. RcFAH12 requires an electron supply from NADH:cytochrome b5 reductase (CBR1) and cytochrome b5 (Cb5) to synthesize ricinoleic acid. Previously, our laboratory found a mutation in the Arabidopsis CBR1 gene, cbr1-1, that caused an 85% decrease in HFA levels in the RcFAH12 Arabidopsis line. These results raise the possibility that electron supply to the heterologous RcFAH12 may limit the production of HFA. Therefore, we hypothesized that by heterologously expressing RcCb5, the reductant supply to RcFAH12 would be improved and lead to increased HFA accumulation in Arabidopsis seeds. Contrary to this proposal, heterologous expression of the top three RcCb5 candidates did not increase HFA accumulation. Furthermore, coexpression of RcCBR1 and RcCb5 in RcFAH12 Arabidopsis also did not increase in HFA levels compared to the parental lines. These results demonstrate that the Arabidopsis electron transfer system is supplying sufficient reductant to RcFAH12 and that there must be other bottlenecks limiting the accumulation of HFA.', u'/articles/2-203/v2', ['Plant Biology, Ecology & Environmental Sciences'], [u'Institute of Biological Chemistry, Washington State University, Pullman, Washington 99164-6340, USA', u'Dow AgroSciences, Indianapolis, IN 46268, USA']]

We have previously shown that this insertion activates a STOP codon-associated latent 5' splice site that competes with the polyadenylation signal during processing of the pre-mRNA. As a result of this dual input from splicing and polyadenylation in the rpn12a-1 mutant, two RPN12a transcripts are produced and they encode the wild-type RPN12a and a chimeric RPN12a-NPTII protein. Both proteins form complexes with other proteasome subunits leading to the formation of wild-type and mutant proteasome versions. The net result of this heterogeneity of proteasome particles is a reduction of total cellular proteasome activity. One of the consequences of reduced proteasomal activity is decreased sensitivity to the major plant hormone cytokinin.Methods: We performed ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis of rpn12a-1 and isolated revertants with wild-type cytokinin sensitivity.Results: We describe the isolation and analyses of suppressor of rpn12a-1 (sor1). The sor1 mutation is intragenic and located at the fifth position of the chimeric intron. This mutation weakens the activated 5' splice site associated with the STOP codon and tilts the processing of the RPN12a mRNA back towards polyadenylation.Conclusions: These results validate our earlier interpretation of the unusual nature of the rpn12a-1 mutation. Furthermore, the data show that optimal 26S proteasome activity requires RPN12a accumulation beyond a critical threshold. Finally, this finding reinforces our previous conclusion that proteasome function is critical for the cytokinin-dependent regulation of plant growth.", u'/articles/2-60/v2', ['Plant Biology, Ecology & Environmental Sciences'], [u'Plant Physiology, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology Program, Department of Plant and Soil Sciences, University of Kentucky, Kentucky, 40546, USA']]

[u'A mutation in negative regulator of basal resistance WRKY17 of Arabidopsis increases susceptibility to Agrobacterium-mediated transient genetic transformation', ['Benoit Lacroix', 'Vitaly Citovsky'], u'15 Feb 2013', u'Agrobacterium is a phytopathogenic bacterium that induces crown gall disease in many plant species by transferring and integrating a segment of its own DNA (T-DNA) into its host genome. Whereas Agrobacterium usually does not trigger an extensive defense response in its host plants, it induces the expression of several defense-related genes and activates plant stress reactions. In the complex interplay between Agrobacterium and its host plant, Agrobacterium has evolved to take advantage of these plant defense pathways for its own purpose of advancement of the infection process. For example, Agrobacterium utilizes the host stress response transcriptional regulator VIP1 to facilitate nuclear import and proteasomal uncoating of its T-DNA during genetic transformation of the host cell. In Arabidopsis, the VIP1 gene expression is repressed by WRKY17, a negative regulator of basal resistance to Pseudomonas. Thus, we examined whether WRKY17 is also involved in plant susceptibility to genetic transformation by Agrobacterium. Using reverse genetics, we showed that a wrky17 mutant displays higher expression of the VIP1 gene in roots, but not in shoots. In a root infection assay, the wrky17 mutant plants were hyper-susceptible to Agrobacterium compared to wild type plants. WRKY17, therefore, may act as a positive regulator of Arabidopsis resistance to Agrobacterium. This notion is important for understanding the complex regulation of Agrobacterium-mediated transient genetic transformation; thus, although this paper reports a relatively small set of data that we do not plan to pursue further in our lab, we believe it might be useful for the broad community of plant pathologists and plant biotechnologists.', u'/articles/2-33/v2', ['Plant Biology, Ecology & Environmental Sciences'], [u'Department of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, State University of New York, New York, 11794-5215, USA']]

Currently bacteria, yeast, insect cells, mammalian cells, transgenic animal and transgenic plants are widely used for the expression of therapeutic proteins. Among these, transgenic plants provide advantages in terms of low production cost, lower capital investment in infrastructure, and suitable post-translational modifications. The major limitation of plants as an expression host is the low level of transgene expression. To increase the expression of heterologous proteins in plants, a number of approaches have been used. One of the approaches is to increase the transgene expression by using tissue-specific promoter(s) which can concentrate the protein of interest in targeted tissues and, thus, prove advantageous in downstream purification. In the present report, a protocol for expression of heterologous protein erythropoietin in potato tuber using patatin, the tuber-tissue-specific promoter, was standardized. Expression vectors for production of the erythropoietin gene under tissue-specific promoter were successfully constructed. For production of a transgenic plant, tissue culture techniques for regeneration of the whole plant from single explants were standardized. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis was performed to confirm the stable integration of the erythropoietin gene in the potato plant by using sequence-specific primers.', u'/articles/1-26/v1', ['Plant Biology, Ecology & Environmental Sciences'], [u'B.V.

[u'Identifying spatial priorities for protecting ecosystem services', ['Gary W Luck', 'Kai MA Chan', 'Carissa J Klien'], u'27 Sep 2012', u'Priorities for protecting ecosystem services must be identified to ensure future human well-being. Approaches to broad-scale spatial prioritization of ecosystem services are becoming increasingly popular and are a vital precursor to identifying locations where further detailed analyses of the management of ecosystem services is required (e.g., examining trade-offs among management actions). Prioritization approaches often examine the spatial congruence between priorities for protecting ecosystem services and priorities for protecting biodiversity; therefore, the spatial prioritization method used is crucial because it will influence the alignment of service protection and conservation goals. While spatial prioritization of ecosystem services and prioritization for conservation share similarities, such as the need to document threats and costs, the former differs substantially from the latter owing to the requirement to measure the following components: supply of services; availability of human-derived alternatives to service provision; capacity to meet beneficiary demand; and site dependency in and scale of service delivery. We review studies that identify broad-scale spatial priorities for managing ecosystem services and demonstrate that researchers have used different approaches and included various measures for identifying priorities, and most studies do not consider all of the components listed above. We describe a conceptual framework for integrating each of these components into spatial prioritization of ecosystem services and illustrate our approach using a worked example for water provision. A fuller characterization of the biophysical and social context for ecosystem services that we call for should improve future prioritization and the identification of locations where ecosystem-service management is especially important or cost effective.', u'/articles/1-17/v1', ['Plant Biology, Ecology & Environmental Sciences'], [u'Institute for Land, Water and Society, Charles Sturt University, Albury, NSW, Australia', u'Institute for Resources, Environment and Sustainability, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada', u'The Ecology Centre, University of Queensland, St. Lucia, Queensland, Australia']]

International guidelines do not agree on unequivocal treatment indications. Recommendations for fascial therapy are few and of low level evidence but several studies indicate strong correlations between fascial thickness and low back pain. This study aims at comparing the effectiveness of Fascial Manipulation\xae associated with a physiotherapy program following guidelines for CALBP compared to a physiotherapy program alone.Methods: 24 subjects were randomized into two groups, both received eight treatments over 4 weeks. Outcomes were measured at baseline, at the end of therapy and at a 1 month and a 3 months follow-up. Pain was measured with the visual analogue scale (VAS) and the brief pain inventory (BPI), function with the Rolland-Morris disability questionnaire (RMDQ), state of well-being with the short-form 36 health-survey (SF-36). The mean clinical important difference (MCID) was also measured.Results: Patients receiving Fascial Manipulation\xae showed statistically and clinically significant improvements at the end of care for all outcomes, in the short (RMDQ, VAS, BPI) and medium term for VAS and BPI compared to manual therapy. The MCID show significant improvements in the means and percentage of subjects in groups in all outcomes post-treatment, in the short and medium term.Conclusion: Fascial tissues were implicated in the aetiology of CALBP and treatment led to decreased symptomatic, improved functional and perceived well-being outcomes that were of greater amplitude compared to manual therapy alone.', u'/articles/4-1208/v2', ['Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'Physiotherapy Academic Program, University of Bologna, Bologna, 40138, Italy', u'Private Practice, Bologna, 40138, Italy', u'Department of Continuity Assistance and Disability, University of Bologna, Bologna, 40138, Italy', u'Department of Emergency, University of Bologna, Bologna, 40138, Italy', u'Private Practice, Padova, 35120, Italy', u'Sports Medicine Unit, University of Padua, Padova, 35120, Italy']]

[u"Using Akaike's information theoretic criterion in mixed-effects modeling of pharmacokinetic data: a simulation study", ['Erik Olofsen', 'Albert Dahan'], u'27 Jul 2015', u'Akaike\'s information theoretic criterion for model discrimination (AIC) is often stated to "overfit", i.e., it selects models with a higher dimension than the dimension of the model that generated the data. However, with experimental pharmacokinetic data it may not be possible to identify the correct model, because of the complexity of the processes governing drug disposition. Instead of trying to find the correct model, a more useful objective might be to minimize the prediction error of drug concentrations in subjects with unknown disposition characteristics. In that case, the AIC might be the selection criterion of choice.We performed Monte Carlo simulations using a model of pharmacokinetic data (a power function of time) with the property that fits with common multi-exponential models can never be perfect - thus resembling the situation with real data. Prespecified models were fitted to simulated data sets, and AIC and AICc (the criterion with a correction for small sample sizes) values were calculated and averaged. The average predictive performances of the models, quantified using simulated validation sets, were compared to the means of the AICs. The data for fits and validation consisted of 11 concentration measurements each obtained in 5 individuals, with three degrees of interindividual variability in the pharmacokinetic volume of distribution.Mean AICc corresponded very well, and better than mean AIC, with mean predictive performance. With increasing interindividual variability, there was a trend towards larger optimal models, but with respect to both lowest AICc and best predictive performance. Furthermore, it was observed that the mean square prediction error itself became less suitable as a validation criterion, and that a predictive performance measure should incorporate interindividual variability.This simulation study showed that, at least in a relatively simple mixed-effects modelling context with a set of prespecified models, minimal mean AICc corresponded to best predictive performance even in the presence of relatively large interindividual variability.', u'/articles/2-71/v3', ['Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'Department of Anesthesiology, Leiden University Medical Center, PO Box 9600, 2300 RC Leiden, Netherlands']]

[u'Update on the pathogenesis of Scleroderma: focus on circulating progenitor cells', ['Alexandra Maria Giovanna Brunasso', 'Cesare Massone'], u'22 Apr 2016', u'In systemic sclerosis (SSc), the development of fibrosis seems to be a consequence of the initial ischemic process related to an endothelial injury. The initial trigger event in SSc is still unknown, but circulating progenitor cells (CPCs) might play a key role. Such cells have the ability to traffic into injury sites, exhibiting inflammatory features of macrophages, tissue remodeling properties of fibroblasts, and vasculogenesis functions of endothelial cells. The different subsets of CPCs described thus far in SSc arise from a pool of circulating monocyte precursors (CD14+ cells) and probably correspond to a different degree of differentiation of a single cell of origin. Several subsets of CPCs have been described in patients with SSc, all have a monocytic origin but may or may not express CD14, and all of these cells have the ability to give origin to endothelial cells, or collagen (Col)-producing cells, or both. We were able to identify six subsets of CPCs: pluripotent stem cells (CD14+, CD45+, and CD34+), monocyte-derived multipotential cells (MOMCs) or monocyte-derived mesenchymal progenitors (CD14+, CD45+, CD34+, Col I+, CD11b+, CD68+, CD105+, and VEGFR1+), early endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) or monocytic pro-angiogenic hematopoietic cells or circulating hematopoietic cells (CD14+, CD45+, CD34low/\u2212, VEGFR2+/\u2212, CXCR4+, c-kit+, and DC117+), late EPCs (CD14\u2212, CD133+, VEGFR2+, CD144+ [VE-cadherin+], and CD146+), fibroblast-like cells (FLCs)/circulating Col-producing monocytes (CD14+, CD45+, CD34+/\u2212, and Col I+), and fibrocytes (CD14\u2212, CD45+, CD34+, Col I+, and CXCR4+). It has been demonstrated that circulating CD14+ monocytes with an activated phenotype are increased in patients with SSc when compared with normal subjects. CD14+, CD34+, and Col I+ spindle-shaped cells have been found in increased numbers in lungs of SSc patients with interstitial lung disease. Elevated blood amounts of early EPCs have been found in patients with SSc by different groups of researchers and such levels correlate directly with the interstitial lung involvement. The prevalence of hematopoietic markers expressed by CPCs that migrate from blood into injury sites in SSc differs and changes according to the degree of differentiation. CXCR4 is the most commonly expressed marker, followed by CD34 and CD45 at an end stage of differentiation. Such difference also indicates a continuous process of cell differentiation that might relate to the SSc clinical phenotype (degree of fibrosis and vascular involvement). A deeper understanding of the role of each subtype of CPCs in the development of the disease will help us to better classify patients in order to offer them targeted approaches in the future.', u'/articles/5-723/v1', ['Cardiopulmonary & Vascular Disorders', 'Bone Disorders', 'Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases', 'Dermatology'], [u'Department of Dermatology, Medical University of Graz, Auenbruggerplatz 8, A-8036 Graz, Austria', u'Department of Dermatology, Galliera Hospital, Genoa, Italy']]

In trials of acute coronary syndromes and stable coronary heart disease, high-intensity statin therapy is more effective in the prevention of recurrent cardiovascular events than low-intensity statin therapy. Thus, evidence-based guidelines recommend in-hospital initiation of high-intensity statin therapy for all acute coronary syndrome patients. Clinical trials report high adherence to and low discontinuation of high-intensity statin therapy; however, in clinical practice, high-intensity statins are prescribed to far fewer patients, who often discontinue their statin after the first refill. A coordinated effort among the patient, provider, pharmacist, health system, and insurer is necessary to improve utilization and persistence of prescribed medications. The major cause for statin discontinuations reported by patients is perceived adverse events. Evaluation of potential adverse events requires validated tools to distinguish between statin-associated adverse events versus non-specific complaints. Treatment options for statin-intolerant patients include the use of a different statin, often at a lower dose or frequency. In order to lower LDL cholesterol, lower doses of statins may be combined with ezetimibe or bile acid sequestrants.

Likewise, people with higher socio-economic status have better oral health than lower socio-economic groups. There has not been much work regarding the influence of socio-economic status on the health conditions of children in developing countries, particularly in Iran. The aim of this study was to compare the oral and general health conditions of primary school children of three different socio-economic areas in the city of Shiraz, Iran.Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 335, 8- to 11-year-old primary schoolchildren in Shiraz. The children were selected by a three-stage cluster sampling method from three socio-economically different areas. Tools and methods used by the United Kingdom\u2019s Medical Research Council were used to obtain anthropometric variables as indicators of general health. The Decay, Missing, Filled Teeth (DMFT) Index for permanent teeth, dmft Index for primary teeth, the Modified Developmental Defects of Enamel (DDE) Index, the Gingival Index (GI) and the Debris Index-Simplified (DI-S) were used for oral health assessment.\xa0Results: Height (P<0.001), weight (P<0.001), and BMI (P=0.001) significantly increased as the socio-economic status of area increased.

While having significant healthcare and social implications, basic robust epidemiological information of wheelchair users is often lacking due in part to this population\u2019s \u201chidden\u201d nature. Increasingly popular in epidemiological research, Respondent Driven Sampling (RDS) provides a mechanism for generating unbiased population-based estimates for hard-to-reach populations, overcoming biases inherent within other sampling methods. This paper reports the first published study to employ RDS amongst wheelchair users.Methods: Between October 2015 and January 2016, a short, successfully piloted, internet-based national survey was initiated. Twenty seeds from diverse organisations were invited to complete the survey then circulate it to peers within their networks following a well-defined protocol. A predetermined reminder protocol was triggered when seeds or their peers failed to respond. All participants were entered into a draw for an iPad.\xa0Results: Overall, 19 people participated (9 women); 12 initial seeds, followed by seven second-wave participants arising from four seeds. Completion time for the survey ranged between 7 and 36 minutes. Despite repeated reminders, no further people were recruited.\xa0Discussion: While New Zealand wheelchair user numbers are unknown, an estimated 14% of people have physical impairments that limited mobility. The 19 respondents generated from adopting the RDS methodology here thus represents a negligible fraction of wheelchair users in New Zealand, and an insufficient number to ensure equilibrium. While successful in other hard-to-reach populations, applying RDS methodology to wheelchairs users requires further consideration.

ET and PMF are two similar disorders in their pathogenesis, which is marked by a key role of the megakaryocyte (MK) lineage. Whereas ET is characterized by MK proliferation, PMF is also associated with aberrant MK differentiation (myelodysplasia), leading to the release of cytokines in the marrow environment, which causes the development of myelofibrosis. Thus, PMF is associated with both myeloproliferation and different levels of myelodysplastic features. MPNs are mostly driven by mutated genes called MPN drivers, which abnormally activate the cytokine receptor/JAK2 pathway and their downstream effectors. The recent discovery of CALR mutations has closed a gap in our knowledge and has shown that this mutated endoplasmic reticulum chaperone activates the thrombopoietin receptor MPL and JAK2. These genetic studies have shown that there are two main types of MPNs: JAK2V617F-MPNs, including ET, PV, and PMF, and the MPL-/CALR-MPNs, which include only ET and PMF. These MPN driver mutations are associated with additional mutations in genes involved in epigenetics, splicing, and signaling, which can precede or follow the acquisition of MPN driver mutations. They are involved in clonal expansion or phenotypic changes or both, leading to myelofibrosis or leukemic transformation or both. Only a few patients with ET exhibit mutations in non-MPN drivers, whereas the great majority of patients with PMF harbor one or several mutations in these genes.

Traditional glaucoma surgeries have a relatively high complication rate and have been reserved for more advanced disease stages. In the analysis presented here we include our data of trabectome combined with cataract surgery. This is a common practice pattern as both occur in the same age group with increasing frequency. For patients in higher glaucoma index (GI) groups, the intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction was 2.34+/-0.19 mmHg more than those in a GI group one level lower while holding everything else constant. Those who had undergone trabectome combined with phacoemulsification had an IOP reduction that was 1.29+/-0.39 mmHg less compared to those with trabectome alone.

The Wnt pathway is a key regulator of both the early and the later, more invasive, stages of CRC development. In the normal intestine and colon, Wnt signaling controls the homeostasis of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) that fuel, via proliferation, upward movement of progeny cells from the crypt bottom toward the villus and differentiation into all cell types that constitute the intestine. Studies in recent years suggested that cancer stem cells (CSCs), similar to ISCs of the crypts, consist of a small subpopulation of the tumor and are responsible for the initiation and progression of the disease. Although various ISC signature genes were also identified as CRC markers and some of these genes were even demonstrated to have a direct functional role in CRC development, the origin of CSCs and their contribution to cancer progression is still debated. Here, we describe studies supporting a relationship between Wnt-regulated CSCs and the progression of CRC.', u'/articles/5-699/v1', ['Endocrinology & Gastroenterology', 'Development & Evolution', 'Oncology & Hematology', 'Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel']]

We then review two major aspects of the current debate: the presumed formal equivalency of the two theories and the question whether group selection can lead to group adaptation. We conclude by arguing that the two theories can offer complementary approaches to the study of social evolution: kin selection approaches usually focus on the identification of optimal phenotypes and thus on the endresult of a selection process, whereas multilevel selection approaches focus on the ongoing selection process itself.

Despite this deep functional conservation and the importance of these genes in AP patterning, key questions remain regarding many aspects of Hox biology. In this commentary, we highlight recent reports that have provided novel insight into the origins of the mammalian Hox cluster, the role of Hox genes in the generation of a limbless body plan, and a novel putative mechanism in which Hox genes may encode specificity along the AP axis.

The parenchymal plaque amyloid is thought to result in an early onsetAlzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) dementia, a phenomenon so common amongst people with DS that it could be considered a defining feature of the condition. The amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene lies on chromosome 21 and its presence in three copies in DS is thought to largely drive the early onset AD. In contrast, intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH), the main clinical consequence of vascular amyloidosis, is a more poorly defined feature of DS. We review recent epidemiological data on stroke (including haemorrhagic stroke) in order to make comparisons with a rare form of familial AD due to duplication (i.e. having three copies) of the APP region on chromosome 21, here called \u2018dup-APP\u2019, which is associated with more frequent and severe ICH.

However, its effect on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage is unknown. We have addressed this issue in a pilot study using human epidermal keratinocytes and melanocytes incubated with alpha-MSH and irradiated with UVB. Real-time touchdown PCR was used to quantify total and deleted mtDNA. The deletion detected encompassed the common deletion but was more sensitive to detection. There were 4.4 times more mtDNA copies in keratinocytes than in melanocytes. Irradiation alone did not affect copy numbers. Alpha-MSH slightly increased copy numbers in both cell types in the absence of UVB and caused a similar small decrease in copy number with dose in both cell types. Deleted copies were nearly twice as frequent in keratinocytes as in melanocytes. Alpha-MSH reduced the frequency of deleted copies by half in keratinocytes but not in melanocytes. UVB dose dependently led to an increase in the deleted copy number in alpha-MSH-treated melanocytes. UVB irradiation had little effect on deleted copy number in alpha-MSH-treated keratinocytes. In summary, alpha-MSH enhances mtDNA damage in melanocytes presumably by increased melanogenesis, while \u03b1-MSH is protective in keratinocytes, the more so in the absence of irradiation.', u'/articles/5-881/v1', ['Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology'], [u'Department of Dermatology, University of M\xfcnster, M\xfcnster, Germany', u'Department of Radiology, Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, Newark, NJ, USA']]

B cells in the germinal center undergo re-iterative cycles of somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin gene variable regions, clonal expansion, and Darwinian selection for cells expressing higher-affinity antibody variants. Alternatively, selected B cells can terminally differentiate into long-lived plasma cells or into a broad diversity of mutated memory B cells; the former secrete the improved antibodies to fight an infection and to provide continuing protection from re-infection, whereas the latter may jumpstart immune responses to subsequent infections with related but distinct infecting agents. Our understanding of the molecules involved in the germinal center reaction has been informed by studies of human immunodeficiency patients with selective defects in the production of antibodies. Recent studies have begun to reveal how innate immune recognition via Toll-like receptors can enhance the magnitude and selective properties of the germinal center, leading to more effective control of infection by a subset of viruses.

For bar flankers, the largest drop in performance (up to 50 percent) occurred with bars placed on all four sides of the target. For letter flankers, flankers placed above and below the target reduced performance as much as four surrounding flankers.

[u'Improving outcome of sensorimotor functions after traumatic spinal cord injury', ['Volker Dietz'], u'27 May 2016', u'In the rehabilitation of a patient suffering a spinal cord injury (SCI), the exploitation of neuroplasticity is well established. It can be facilitated through the training of functional movements with technical assistance as needed and can improve outcome after an SCI. The success of such training in individuals with incomplete SCI critically depends on the presence of physiological proprioceptive input to the spinal cord leading to meaningful muscle activations during movement performances. Some actual preclinical approaches to restore function by compensating for the loss of descending input to spinal networks following complete/incomplete SCI are critically discussed in this report. Electrical and pharmacological stimulation of spinal neural networks is still in the experimental stage, and despite promising repair studies in animal models, translations to humans up to now have not been convincing.

Nevertheless, given the marked heterogeneity in clinical phenotype and the considerable overlap of IPF with other fibrotic interstitial lung diseases (ILDs), about 10% of cases of pulmonary fibrosis remain unclassifiable.

The development and validation of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers are necessary to enable a more precise and earlier diagnosis of IPF and to improve prediction of future disease behaviour. The availability of approved antifibrotic therapies together with potential new drugs currently under evaluation also highlights the need for biomarkers able to predict and assess treatment responsiveness, thereby allowing individualised treatment based on risk of progression and drug response.

[u'MEPPitope: spatial, electrostatic and secondary structure perturbations in the post-fusion Dengue virus envelope protein highlights known epitopes and conserved residues in the Zika virus', ['Sandeep Chakraborty'], u'03 Jun 2016', u'The dramatic transformation of the Zika virus (ZIKV) from a relatively unknown virus to a pathogen generating global-wide panic has exposed the dearth of detailed knowledge about this virus. Decades of research in the related Dengue virus (DENV), finally culminating in a vaccine registered for use in endemic regions (CYD-TDV), provides key insights in developing strategies for tackling ZIKV. The previously established MEPP methodology compares two conformations of the same protein and identifies residues with significant spatial and electrostatic perturbations. In the current work, MEPP analyzed the pre-and post-fusion DENV type 2 envelope (E) protein, and identified several known epitopes (His317, Tyr299, Glu26, Arg188, etc.) (MEPPitope). These residues are overwhelmingly conserved in ZIKV and all DENV serotypes. Characterization of \u03b1-helices in E-proteins show that \u03b11 is not conserved in the sequence space of ZIKV and DENV. Furthermore, perturbation of \u03b11 in the post-fusion DENV structure includes a known epitope Asp215, a residue absent in the pre-fusion \u03b11. A cationic \u03b2-sheet in the GAG-binding domain that is stereochemically equivalent in ZIKV and all DENV serotypes is also highlighted due to a residue pair (Arg286-Arg288) that has a significant electrostatic polarity reversal upon fusion. Finally, two highly conserved residues (Thr32 and Thr40), with little emphasis in existing literature, are found to have significant electrostatic perturbation.

[u'DRIMSeq: a Dirichlet-multinomial framework for multivariate count outcomes in genomics', ['Malgorzata Nowicka', 'Mark D. Robinson'], u'13 Jun 2016', u'There are many instances in genomics data analyses where measurements are made on a multivariate response. For example, alternative splicing can lead to multiple expressed isoforms from the same primary transcript. There are situations where the total abundance of gene expression does not change (e.g. between normal and disease state), but differences in the relative ratio of expressed isoforms may have significant phenotypic consequences or lead to prognostic capabilities. Similarly, knowledge of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that affect splicing, so-called splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTL), will help to characterize the effects of genetic variation on gene expression. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has provided an attractive toolbox to carefully unravel alternative splicing outcomes and recently, fast and accurate methods for transcript quantification have become available. We propose a statistical framework based on the Dirichlet-multinomial distribution that can discover changes in isoform usage between conditions and SNPs that affect splicing outcome using these quantifications. The Dirichlet-multinomial model naturally accounts for the differential gene expression without losing information about overall gene abundance and by joint modeling of isoform expression, it has the capability to account for their correlated nature. The main challenge in this approach is to get robust estimates of model parameters with limited numbers of replicates. We approach this by sharing information and show that our method improves on existing approaches in terms of standard statistical performance metrics. The framework is applicable to other multivariate scenarios, such as Poly-A-seq or where beta-binomial models have been applied (e.g., differential DNA methylation). Our method is available as a Bioconductor R package called DRIMSeq.', u'/articles/5-1356/v1', ['Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, University of Zurich, Zurich, 8057, Switzerland', u'SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, University of Zurich, Zurich, 8057, Switzerland']]

All three share an infection strategy that relies on a virulence factor arsenal to enable them to enter, adhere to, and colonise the host while evading host defences to avoid untimely clearance. Their arsenal includes a number of adhesins that allow the invading pathogens to establish a foothold in the host and to adhere to specific tissues later during infection. When the host innate immune system has been activated, all three pathogens produce a structure analogous to a hypodermic needle. In conjunction with the translocon, which forms a pore in the host membrane, the channel that is formed enables the transfer of six \u2018effector\u2019 proteins into the host cell cytoplasm. These proteins mimic host cell proteins but are more efficient than their native counterparts at modifying the host cell cytoskeleton, triggering the host cell suicide response.

Plasmodium falciparum causes malaria, and thus the recent emergence of resistance against the currently used drug combinations based on artemisinin has been of major interest for the scientific community. It resulted in great advances in understanding the resistance mechanisms that can hopefully be translated into altered future drug regimens. Apicomplexa are also experts in host cell manipulation and immune evasion. Toxoplasma gondii and Theileria sp., besides Plasmodium sp., are species that secrete effector molecules into the host cell to reach this aim. The underlying molecular mechanisms for how these proteins are trafficked to the host cytosol (T. gondii and Plasmodium) and how a secreted protein can immortalize the host cell (Theileria sp.) have been illuminated recently. Moreover, how such secreted proteins affect the host innate immune responses against T. gondii and the liver stages of Plasmodium has also been unraveled at the genetic and molecular level, leading to unexpected insights.\r\nMethodological advances in metabolomics and molecular biology have been instrumental to solving some fundamental puzzles of mitochondrial carbon metabolism in Apicomplexa.

[u'Recent insights into the molecular mechanisms of the NLRP3 inflammasome activation', ['Tomasz Prochnicki', 'Matthew S. Mangan', 'Eicke Latz'], u'22 Jun 2016', u'Inflammasomes are high-molecular-weight protein complexes that are formed in the cytosolic compartment in response to danger- or pathogen-associated molecular patterns. These complexes enable activation of an inflammatory protease caspase-1, leading to a cell death process called pyroptosis and to proteolytic cleavage and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and IL-18. Along with caspase-1, inflammasome components include an adaptor protein, ASC, and a sensor protein, which triggers the inflammasome assembly in response to a danger signal. The inflammasome sensor proteins are pattern recognition receptors belonging either to the NOD-like receptor (NLR) or to the AIM2-like receptor family. While the molecular agonists that induce inflammasome formation by AIM2 and by several other NLRs have been identified, it is not well understood how the NLR family member NLRP3 is activated. Given that NLRP3 activation is relevant to a range of human pathological conditions, significant attempts are being made to elucidate the molecular mechanism of this process. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the molecular events that lead to activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in response to a range of K+ efflux-inducing danger signals.

Several meta-analyses of many statin trials as well as longitudinal population-based studies suggest that the risk factors for diabetes in statin-treated persons include underlying risk for diabetes at baseline (specifically features of metabolic syndrome), the intensity of statin therapy, certain genetic traits independent of diabetes risk, and adherence to lifestyle factors. Limited data suggest statins modestly worsen hyperglycemia and A1c levels in those with pre-existing diabetes or glucose intolerance. The precise mechanism(s) of diabetogenesis with statin therapy are unclear, but impaired insulin sensitivity and compromised \u03b2 cell function via enhanced intracellular cholesterol uptake due to inhibition of intracellular cholesterol synthesis by statins, as well as other mechanisms, may be involved. Furthermore, while statins are known to have anti-inflammatory effects, it is hypothesized that, under dysmetabolic conditions, they might have pro-inflammatory effects via induction of certain inflammasomes. This concept requires further elucidation in the human.

[u'Pathogenesis of myasthenia gravis: update on disease types, models, and mechanisms', ['William D. Phillips', 'Angela Vincent'], u'27 Jun 2016', u'Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) caused by antibodies that attack components of the postsynaptic membrane, impair neuromuscular transmission, and lead to weakness and fatigue of skeletal muscle. This can be generalised or localised to certain muscle groups, and involvement of the bulbar and respiratory muscles can be life threatening. The pathogenesis of myasthenia gravis depends upon the target and isotype of the autoantibodies. Most cases are caused by immunoglobulin (Ig)G1 and IgG3 antibodies to the acetylcholine receptor (AChR). They produce complement-mediated damage and increase the rate of AChR turnover, both mechanisms causing loss of AChR from the postsynaptic membrane. The thymus gland is involved in many patients, and there are experimental and genetic approaches to understand the failure of immune tolerance to the AChR. In a proportion of those patients without AChR antibodies, antibodies to muscle-specific kinase (MuSK), or related proteins such as agrin and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 (LRP4), are present. MuSK antibodies are predominantly IgG4 and cause disassembly of the neuromuscular junction by disrupting the physiological function of MuSK in synapse maintenance and adaptation.

It produces complex, goal-directed motion of one hand that is involuntarily instigated. This syndrome characteristically arises after braintrauma, brain surgery, stroke or encephalitis. We describe a case of AHS in a patient who had a previous episode of subarachnoid hemorrhage affecting the left frontal lobe and corpus callosum.\nCase presentation:\r\nAn 84-year-old woman presented to the emergency department complaining of headaches and several episodes of her left arm moving as if it wasgroping around trying to grab at her own body.\xa0 A computed tomography scanof the head demonstrated an acute left superior frontal hemorrhage with compression of the corpus callosum. Transcranial Doppler report showed no significant abnormality in the insonated vessels. After being stabilized for the acute bleed, she was treated with clonazepam 0.5 mgat night for the uncontrolled hand movements.\xa0 Her movements resolved by her next month follow up. The diagnosis of AHS was made based on her clinical presentation, characterization of the movement and localization correlating with findings in neuroimaging.\nConclusion:\r\nWe document a rare neurologic disorder seen in patients presenting with a history of previous strokes and a typical description of involuntary and unintentional, uncontrolled unilateral arm movements with repetitive grasping.

[u'Hospital and patient influencing factors of treatment schemes given to type 2 diabetes mellitus inpatients in Inner Mongolia, China', ['Nan Zhang', 'Edward McNeil', 'Sawitri Assanangkornchai', 'Yancun Fan'], u'05 Jul 2016', u'Background:\r\nIn clinical practice, the physician\u2019s treatment decision making is influenced by many factors besides the patient\u2019s clinical conditions and is the fundamental cause of healthcare inequity and discrimination in healthcare settings. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic disease with high prevalence, long average length of stay and high hospitalization rate. Although the treatment of T2DM is well guideline driven, there is a large body of evidence showing the existence of treatment disparities. More empirical studies from the provider side are needed to determine if non-clinical factors influence physician\u2019s treatment choices.\r\n\xa0\nObjective:\r\nTo determine the hospital and patient influencing factors of treatment schemes given to T2DM inpatients in Inner Mongolia, China.\r\n\xa0\nMethods:\r\nA cross-sectional, hospital-based survey using a cluster sampling technique was conducted in three tertiary hospitals and three county hospitals in Inner Mongolia, China. Treatment schemes were categorized as lifestyle management, oral therapy or insulin therapy according to the national guideline. Socio-demographic characteristics and variables related to severity of disease at the individual level and hospital level were collected. Weighted multinomial logistic regression models were used to determine influencing factors of treatment schemes.\r\n\xa0\nResults:\r\nRegardless of patients\u2019 clinical conditions and health insurance types, both hospital and patient level variables were associated with treatment schemes. Males were more likely to be given oral therapy (RRR=1.72, 95% CI=1.06-2.81) and insulin therapy (RRR=1.94, 95% CI=1.29-2.91) compared to females who were given lifestyle management more frequently. Compared to the western region, hospitals in the central regions of Inner Mongolia were less likely to prescribe T2DM patients oral therapy (RRR = 0.18, 95% CI=0.05-0.61) and insulin therapy (RRR = 0.20, 95% CI=0.06-0.67) than lifestyle management.

[u'An open RNA-Seq data analysis pipeline tutorial with an example of reprocessing data from a recent Zika virus study', ['Zichen Wang', "Avi Ma'ayn"], u'05 Jul 2016', u'RNA-seq analysis is becoming a standard method for global gene expression profiling. However, open and standard pipelines to perform RNA-seq analysis by non-experts remain challenging due to the large size of the raw data files and the hardware requirements for running the alignment step. Here we introduce a reproducible open source RNA-seq pipeline delivered as an IPython notebook and a Docker image. The pipeline uses state-of-the-art tools and can run on various platforms with minimal configuration overhead. The pipeline enables the extraction of knowledge from typical RNA-seq studies by generating interactive principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering (HC) plots, performing enrichment analyses against over 90 gene set libraries, and obtaining lists of small molecules that are predicted to either mimic or reverse the observed changes in mRNA expression. We apply the pipeline to a recently published RNA-seq dataset collected from human neuronal progenitors infected with the Zika virus (ZIKV). In addition to confirming the presence of cell cycle genes among the genes that are downregulated by ZIKV, our analysis uncovers significant overlap with upregulated genes that when knocked out in mice induce defects in brain morphology. This result potentially points to the molecular processes associated with the microcephaly phenotype observed in newborns from pregnant mothers infected with the virus. In addition, our analysis predicts small molecules that can either mimic or reverse the expression changes induced by ZIKV.

In particular, we describe a new simple method that makes use of a cutting grid device and is applied to clear cell renal cell carcinomas for DAC implementation. This method assures a thorough sampling of large surgical specimens, facilitates the demonstration of intratumor heterogeneity, and saves time to pathologists in the daily practice. The method involves the following steps: 1. Thin slicing of the tumor (by hand or machine), 2. Application of a cutting grid to the slices (e.g., a French fry cutter), resulting in multiple tissue cubes with fixed position within the slice, 3. Selection of tissue cubes for analysis, and finally, 4. Inclusion of selected cubes into a cassette for histological processing (with about eight tissue fragments within each cassette). Thus, using our approach in a 10 cm in-diameter-tumor we generate 80 tumor tissue fragments placed in 10 cassettes and, notably, in a tenth of time.

Investigations into the nature of health have led to a new definition that explains health as a complex adaptive system (CAS) and is based on five components (a-e).

For this purpose they need (b) a biologically given potential (BGP) and (c) a personally acquired potential (PAP). These properties of individuals are embedded within (d) social and (e) environmental determinants of health. Between these five components of health there are 10 complex interactions that justify health to be viewed as a CAS. In each patient, the current state of his health as a CAS evolved from the past, will move forward to a new future, and has to be analyzed and treated as an autonomous whole. A diagnostic procedure is suggested as follows: together with the patient, the five components and 10 complex interactions are assessed. This may help the patient to better understand his situation and to recognize possible next steps that may be useful for him to evolve toward more health by himself.

The relative importance of a hub node, however, can change depending on the biological context. Here, we report a Cytoscape app, the Contextual Hub Analysis Tool (CHAT), which enables users to easily construct and visualize a network of interactions from a gene list of interest, integrate contextual information, such as gene expression data, and identify hub nodes that are more highly connected to contextual nodes (e.g. genes that are differentially expressed) than expected by chance. In a case study, we use CHAT to construct a network of genes that are differentially expressed in Dengue fever, a viral infection. CHAT was used to identify and compare contextual and degree-based hubs in this network. The top 20 degree-based hubs were enriched in pathways related to the cell cycle and cancer, which is likely due to the fact that proteins involved in these processes tend to be highly connected in general. In comparison, the top 20 contextual hubs were enriched in pathways commonly observed in a viral infection including pathways related to the immune response to viral infection. This analysis shows that such contextual hubs are considerably more biologically relevant than degree-based hubs and that analyses which rely on the identification of hubs solely based on their connectivity may be biased towards nodes that are highly connected in general rather than in the specific context of interest.\r\n\xa0\r\nAvailability: CHAT is available for Cytoscape 3.0+ and can be installed via the Cytoscape App Store (http://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/chat).', u'/articles/5-1745/v1', ['Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'EMBL Australia Biomedical Informatics Group, Infection & Immunity Theme, South Australian Medical and Health Research Institute, Adelaide, Australia', u'Animal and Bioscience Research Department, Animal and Grassland Research and Innovation Centre, Teagasc, Meath, Ireland', u'School of Medicine, Flinders University, Bedford Park, Australia']]

However, several studies have shown that the methodology rather than the biological variation is responsible for the observed sample composition and distribution. This compromises true meta-analyses, although this fact is often disregarded.\nResults\r\nTo facilitate true meta-analysis of microbiome studies, we developed NG-Tax, a pipeline for 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequence analysis that was validated with different mock communities and benchmarked against QIIME as the currently most frequently used pipeline. The microbial composition of 49 independently amplified mock samples was characterized by sequencing two variable 16S rRNA gene regions, V4 and V5-V6, in three separate sequencing runs on Illumina\u2019s HiSeq2000 platform. This allowed evaluating important factors of technical bias in taxonomic classification: 1) run-to-run sequencing variation, 2) PCR\u2013error, and 3) region/primer specific amplification bias. Despite the short read length (~140 nt) and all technical biases, the average specificity of the taxonomic assignment for the phylotypes included in the mock communities was 96%. On average 99.94% and 92.02% of the reads could be assigned to at least family or genus level, respectively, while assignment to \u2018spurious genera\u2019 represented on average only 0.02% of the reads per sample.

Rash', 'Glenn F. King', 'Katarzyna M. Dziegielewska', 'Norman R. Saunders', 'Mark D. Habgood'], u'26 Jul 2016', u'Tissue loss after spinal trauma is biphasic, with initial mechanical/haemorrhagic damage at the time of impact being followed by gradual secondary expansion into adjacent, previously unaffected tissue. Limiting the extent of this secondary expansion of tissue damage has the potential to preserve greater residual spinal cord function in patients. The acute tissue hypoxia resulting from spinal cord injury (SCI) activates acid-sensing ion channel 1a (ASIC1a). We surmised that antagonism of this channel should provide neuroprotection and functional preservation after SCI. We show that systemic administration of the spider-venom peptide PcTx1, a selective inhibitor of ASIC1a, improves locomotor function in adult Sprague Dawley rats after thoracic SCI. The degree of functional improvement correlated with the degree of tissue preservation in descending white matter tracts involved in hind limb locomotor function. Transcriptomic analysis suggests that PcTx1-induced preservation of spinal cord tissue does not result from a reduction in apoptosis, with no evidence of down-regulation of key genes involved in either the intrinsic or extrinsic apoptotic pathways. We also demonstrate that trauma-induced disruption of blood-spinal cord barrier function persists for at least 4 days post-injury for compounds up to 10 kDa in size, whereas barrier function is restored for larger molecules within a few hours. This temporary loss of barrier function provides a \u201ctreatment window\u201d through which systemically administered drugs have unrestricted access to spinal tissue in and around the sites of trauma. Taken together, our data provide evidence to support the use of ASIC1a inhibitors as a therapeutic treatment for SCI.

This decline may be due to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and the system L amino acid transporter LAT1 may be a biomarker of this process. In this study, we used 5-(2-18F-fluoroethoxy)-L-tryptophan (18F-L-FEHTP) to target LAT1 as a potential biomarker of beta cell function in diabetes.\nProcedures: Uptake of 18F-L-FEHTP was determined in wild-type C57BL/6 mice by ex vivo biodistribution. Both dynamic and static positron emission tomography (PET) images were acquired in wild-type and Akita mice, a model of ER stress-induced diabetes, as well as in mice treated with streptozotocin (STZ). LAT1 expression in both groups of mice was evaluated by immunofluorescence microscopy.\nResults: Uptake of 18F-L-FEHTP was highest in the pancreas, and static PET images showed highly specific pancreatic signal. Time-activity curves showed significantly reduced 18F-L-FEHTP uptake in Akita mice, and LAT1 expression was also reduced. However, mice treated with STZ, in which beta cell mass was reduced by 62%, showed no differences in 18F-L-FEHTP uptake in the pancreas, and there was no significant correlation of 18F-L-FEHTP uptake with beta cell mass.\nConclusions: 18F-L-FEHTP is highly specific for the pancreas with little background uptake in kidney or liver. We were able to detect changes in LAT1 in a mouse model of diabetes, but these changes did not correlate with beta cell function or mass.

It is clear conventional wastewater treatment technologies are not meeting the challenge of the mounting pressures on global freshwater supplies. Cost-effective ecological wastewater treatment technologies have been developed in response. To determine whether the removal of micropollutants in ecological wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is promoted by the plant-microbe interactions, as has been reported for other recalcitrant xenobiotics, biofilm microbial communities growing on the surfaces of plant roots were profiled by whole metagenome sequencing and compared to the microbial communities residing in the wastewater. In this study, the concentrations of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) were quantified in each treatment tank of the ecological WWTP treating human wastewater at a highway rest stop and visitor center in Vermont. The concentrations of detected PPCPs were substantially greater than values reported for conventional WWTPs likely due to onsite recirculation of wastewater. The greatest reductions in PPCPs concentrations were observed in the anoxic treatment tank where Bacilli dominated the biofilm community. Benzoate degradation was the most abundant xenobiotic metabolic category identified throughout the system.

Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to TB in the past and studies have found vitamin D deficiency to be common among Ugandan TB patients. The functional activity of vitamin D is dependent on the genotype of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) polymorphic genes. Recent findings have indicated that VDR polymorphisms may cause increased resistance or susceptibility to TB. The vitamin D ligand and its receptor play a pivotal role in innate immunity by eliciting antimicrobial activity, which is important in prevention of TB. The fok I vitamin D receptor gene has extensively been examined in TB patients but findings so far have been inconclusive.\nObjectives: This study sought to investigate the frequency distribution of the VDR fok I gene polymorphisms in pulmonary TB patients and controls.\nMethods: A pilot case control study of 41 newly diagnosed TB patients and 41 healthy workers was set up. Vitamin D receptor fok I gene was genotyped.\nResults: The frequency distribution of fok I genotype in Ugandan TB patients was 87.8% homozygous-dominant (FF), 7.3% (Ff) heterozygous and 4.8% (ff) homozygous recessive. For normal healthy subjects the frequencies were (FF) 92.6%, (Ff) 2.4% and (ff) 4.8%. No significant difference was observed in the FF and ff genotypes among TB patients and controls. The Ff heterozygous genotype distribution appeared more in TB patients than in controls. A significant difference was observed in the fok I genotype among gender p value 0.02.

A history of having received previous transfusions was observed in both HBsAg positive cases (7/15) and the anti-HCV positive cases (5/17). Elevated transaminase levels were observed in patients with positive and negative serology.\nConclusion: The results of this study demonstrate a high prevalence of serological markers for HBV and HCV in patients with CRF on hemodialysis in city of Posadas (Argentina), as compared to cities in developed countries.', u'/articles/5-1910/v1', ['Public Health & Epidemiology', 'Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases'], [u'Faculty of Exact, Chemical and Natural Sciences, Universidad Nacional de Misiones, Posadas, 3300, Argentina', u'Faculty of Technology, Universidad Distrital Francisco Jos\xe9 de Caldas, Bogot\xe1, Colombia']]

[u'Navigating the Zika panic', ['Nathan D. Grubaugh', 'Kristian G.

These epidemics also exposed how unprepared we are to handle infectious disease emergencies. This is also true when we consider hypothesized new clinical features of infection, such as the associations between Zika virus infection and severe neurological disease, including microcephaly and Guillain-Barr\xe9 syndrome. On the surface, these pathologies appear to be new features of Zika virus infection, however, causal relationships have not yet been established. Decades of limited Zika virus research are making us scramble to determine the true drivers behind the epidemic, often at the expense of over-speculation without credible evidence. Here we review the literature and find no conclusive evidence at this time for significant biological differences between the American Zika virus strains and those circulating elsewhere. Rather, the epidemic scale in the Americas may be facilitated by an abnormally warm climate, dense human and mosquito populations, and previous exposure to other viruses. Severe disease associated with Zika virus may therefore not be a new trait for the virus, rather it may have been overlooked due to previously small outbreaks. Much of the recent panic regarding Zika virus has been about the Olympics in Brazil. We do not find any substantial evidence that the Olympics will result in a significant number of new Zika virus infections (~10 predicted) or that the Olympics will promote further epidemic spread over what is already expected.

Here, we assembled an interactome of IFITM1 and IFITM3 with known protein-protein interactions (PPIs) collected from publicly available databases and novel PPIs predicted using High-confidence Protein-Protein Interaction Prediction (HiPPIP) model. We analyzed the functional and pathway associations of the interacting proteins, and found that there are several immunity pathways (interferon signaling, cd28 signaling in T-helper cells crosstalk between dendritic cells and natural killer cells), neuronal pathways (axonal guidance signaling, neural tube closure and actin cytoskeleton signaling) and developmental pathways that are associated with these interactors.

[u'Neurosteroids are reduced in diabetic neuropathy and may be associated with the development of neuropathic pain', ['Stephen R. Humble'], u'05 Aug 2016', u'Introduction: Peripheral and central sensitisation are implicated in the development of neuropathic pain. Hypersensitivity of pain pathway neurons has been described in animal models of diabetic neuropathy, which is postulated to be related to an imbalance between inhibitory and excitatory signals within the spinal cord. GABAergic neurons within the pain pathway are vital for the transmission of painful stimuli to higher centres. A developmental change in the rate of exponential decay of GABAergic synaptic events has been observed in other types of neurons and this may be associated with fluctuations in endogenous neurosteroid tone.\xa0\r\n\xa0\r\nMethods: The whole-cell patch-clamp technique was used on slices of neural tissue. Electrophysiological recordings were obtained from wild type mice between the ages of 6 and 80 days in the spinal cord, the nucleus reticularis of the thalamus and the cerebral cortex. Recordings were also obtained from mice with diabetic neuropathy (ob/ob and db/db) between the ages of 60 and 80 days. Behavioural experiments were performed to examine mechanical and thermal nociception.\r\n\xa0\r\nResults: Electrophysiological recordings from cortical pain pathway neurons from mature type-2 diabetic mice revealed that the endogenous neurosteroid tone is reduced compared to control. However, selected neurosteroid compounds had a more pronounced effect on the GABAA receptors of these diabetic mice. ob/ob mice exhibit mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia, which was reduced by neurosteroids applied exogenously.\r\n\xa0\r\nConclusions: The reduced endogenous neurosteroid tone in ob/ob mice may be linked to their hypersensitivity.

Here we present a multi-scale computational model to describe and explain the activation of different cell types in motor cortex due to transcranial magnetic stimulation. Our model determines precise electric fields based on an individual head model derived from magnetic resonance imaging and calculates how these electric fields activate morphologically detailed models of different neuron types. We predict detailed neural activation patterns for different coil orientations consistent with experimental findings. Beyond this, our model allows us to predict activation thresholds for individual neurons and precise initiation sites of individual action potentials on the neurons\u2019 complex morphologies. Specifically, our model predicts that cortical layer 3 pyramidal neurons are generally easier to stimulate than layer 5 pyramidal neurons, thereby explaining the lower stimulation thresholds observed for I-waves compared to D-waves. It also predicts differences in the regions of activated cortical layer 5 and layer 3 pyramidal cells depending on coil orientation. Finally, it predicts that under standard stimulation conditions, action potentials are mostly generated at the axon initial segment of corctial pyramidal cells, with a much less important activation site being the part of a layer 5 pyramidal cell axon where it crosses the boundary between grey matter and white matter.

High resolution melting (HRM) analyses, a closed-tube, post-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method used to identify variations in nucleic acid sequences, has been used to differentiate species within the Anopheles gambiae and Culex pipiens complexes. We validated the use of PCR-HRM analyses to differentiate species within Anopheles and within each of six genera of culicine mosquitoes, comparing primers targeting cytochrome b (cyt b), NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 (ND1), intergenic spacer region (IGS) and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene regions.

However, existing bovine WGS databases do not show data in a form conducive to protein variant analysis, and tend to under represent the breadth of genetic diversity in U.S. beef cattle. Thus, our first aim was to use 96 beef sires, sharing minimal pedigree relationships, to create a searchable and publicly viewable set of mapped genomes relevant for 19 popular breeds of U.S. cattle. Our second aim was to identify protein variants encoded by the bovine endothelial PAS domain-containing protein 1 gene (EPAS1), a gene associated with high-altitude pulmonary hypertension in Angus cattle. The identity and quality of genomic sequences were verified by comparing WGS genotypes to those derived from other methods. The average read depth, genotype scoring rate, and genotype accuracy exceeded 14, 99%, and 99%, respectively. The 96 genomes were used to discover four amino acid variants encoded by EPAS1 (E270Q, P362L, A671G, and L701F) and confirm two variants previously associated with disease (A606T and G610S). The six EPAS1 missense mutations were verified with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry assays, and their frequencies were estimated in a separate collection of 1154 U.S. cattle representing 46 breeds. A rooted phylogenetic tree of eight polypeptide sequences provided a framework for evaluating the likely order of mutations and potential impact of EPAS1 alleles on the adaptive response to chronic hypoxia in U.S. cattle.

It is a longstanding proposal that such fluctuations generically arise from chaotic network dynamics. Various theoretical studies predict that the rich dynamics of rate models operating in the chaotic regime can subserve circuit computation and learning. Neurons in the brain, however, communicate via spikes and it is a theoretical challenge to obtain similar rate fluctuations in networks of spiking neuron models.\n\r\nA recent study investigated spiking balanced networks of leaky integrate and fire (LIF) neurons and compared their dynamics to a matched rate network with identical topology, where single unit input-output functions were chosen from isolated LIF neurons receiving Gaussian white noise input. A mathematical analogy between the chaotic instability in networks of rate units and the spiking network dynamics was proposed.\n\r\nHere we revisit the behavior of the spiking LIF networks and these matched rate networks. We find expected hallmarks of a chaotic instability in the rate network: For supercritical coupling strength near the transition point, the autocorrelation time diverges. For subcritical coupling strengths, we observe critical slowing down in response to small external perturbations. In the spiking network, we found in contrast that the timescale of the autocorrelations is insensitive to the coupling strength and that rate deviations resulting from small input perturbations rapidly decay. The decay speed even accelerates for increasing coupling strength.\n\r\nIn conclusion, our reanalysis demonstrates fundamental differences between the behavior of pulse-coupled spiking LIF networks and rate networks with matched topology and input-output function.

A formal spatial statistical model has been developed and used to characterise the structural heterogeneity of a number of supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumours (PNETs), based on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Particular attention is paid to the spatial dependence of diffusion close to the tumour boundary, in order to determine whether the data provide statistical evidence to support the proposition that water diffusivity in the boundary region of some tumours exhibits a deterministic dependence on distance from the boundary, in excess of an underlying random 2D spatial heterogeneity in diffusion. Tumour spatial heterogeneity measures were derived from the diffusion parameter estimates obtained using a Bayesian spatial random effects model. The analyses were implemented using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. Posterior predictive simulation was used to assess the adequacy of the statistical model. The main observations are that the previously reported relationship between diffusion and boundary proximity remains observable and achieves statistical significance after adjusting for an underlying random 2D spatial heterogeneity in the diffusion model parameters. A comparison of the magnitude of the boundary-distance effect with the underlying random 2D boundary heterogeneity suggests that both are important sources of variation in the vicinity of the boundary. No consistent pattern emerges from a comparison of the boundary and core spatial heterogeneity, with no indication of a consistently greater level of heterogeneity in one region compared with the other.

[u'Estimating limits for natural human embryo mortality', ['Gavin E. Jarvis'], u'26 Aug 2016', u'Natural human embryonic mortality is generally considered to be high. Values of 70% and higher are widely cited. However, it is difficult to determine accurately owing to an absence of direct data quantifying embryo loss between fertilisation and implantation. The best available data for quantifying pregnancy loss come from three published prospective studies (Wilcox, Zinaman and Wang) with daily cycle by cycle monitoring of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) in women attempting to conceive. Declining conception rates cycle by cycle in these studies indicate that a proportion of the study participants were sub-fertile. Hence, estimates of fecundability and pre-implantation embryo mortality obtained from the whole study cohort will inevitably be biased. This new re-analysis of aggregate data from these studies confirms the impression that discrete fertile and sub-fertile sub-cohorts were present. The proportion of sub-fertile women in the three studies was estimated as 28.1% (Wilcox), 22.8% (Zinaman) and 6.0% (Wang). The probability of conceiving an CG pregnancy (indicating embryo implantation) was, respectively, 43.2%, 38.1% and 46.2% among normally fertile women, and 7.6%, 2.5% and 4.7% among sub-fertile women. Pre-implantation loss is impossible to calculate directly from available data although plausible limits can be estimated.

[u'Clonal selection versus clonal cooperation: the integrated perception of immune objects', ['Serge Nataf'], u'05 Sep 2016', u'Analogies between the immune and nervous systems were first envisioned by the immunologist Niels Jerne who introduced the concepts of antigen "recognition" and immune "memory". However, since then, it appears that only the cognitive immunology paradigm proposed by Irun Cohen, attempted to further theorize the immune system functions through the prism of neurosciences. The present paper is aimed at revisiting this analogy-based reasoning. In particular, a parallel is drawn between the brain pathways of visual perception and the processes allowing the global perception of an "immune object". Thus, in the visual system, distinct features of a visual object (shape, color, motion) are perceived separately by distinct neuronal populations during a primary perception task. The output signals generated during this first step instruct then an integrated perception task performed by other neuronal networks. Such a higher order perception step is by essence a cooperative task that is mandatory for the global perception of visual objects. Based on a re-interpretation of recent experimental data, it is suggested that similar general principles drive the integrated perception of immune objects in secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs). In this scheme, the four main categories of signals characterizing an immune object (antigenic, contextual, temporal and localization signals) are first perceived separately by distinct networks of immunocompetent cells.\xa0 Then, in a multitude of SLO niches, the output signals generated during this primary perception step are integrated by TH-cells at the single cell level. This process eventually generates a multitude of T-cell and B-cell clones that perform, at the scale of SLOs, an integrated perception of immune objects. Overall, this new framework proposes that integrated immune perception and, consequently, integrated immune responses, rely essentially on clonal cooperation rather than clonal selection.', u'/articles/5-2226/v1', ['Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases'], [u'Bank of Tissues and Cells, Lyon University Hospital (Hospices Civils de Lyon), CarMeN Laboratory, INSERM 1060, INRA 1397, INSA Lyon, Universit\xe9 Claude Bernard Lyon-1, University Lyon-1, Lyon, France']]

The multiplicity of surgical targets is intriguing and may be partly due to the complexity of GTS, specifically the various and frequent associated psychiatric comorbidities in this disorder. Thus, the target choice may not only be aimed at reducing tics but also comorbidities. While this approach is laudable, it also carries the risk to increase confounding factors in DBS trials and patient evaluation. Moreover, I question whether DBS should really be expected to alleviate multiple symptoms at a time. Rather, I argue that tic reduction should remain our primary objective in severe GTS patients and that this intervention may subsequently allow an improved psychotherapeutic and/or pharmacological treatment of comorbidities.

We have created a mouse model (Mecp2 A140V \u201cknock-in\u201d mutant) expressing the recurrent human MECP2 A140V mutation linked to an X-linked mental retardation/Rett syndrome phenotype. Morphological analyses focused on quantifying soma and nucleus size were performed on primary hippocampus and cerebellum granule neuron (CGN) cultures from mutant (Mecp2A140V/y) and wild type (Mecp2+/y) male mice. Cultured hippocampus and cerebellar granule neurons from mutant animals were significantly smaller than neurons from wild type animals. We also examined soma size in hippocampus neurons from individual female transgenic mice that express both a mutant\xa0 (maternal allele) and a wild type Mecp2 gene linked to an eGFP transgene (paternal allele). In cultures from such doubly heterozygous female mice, the size of neurons expressing the mutant (A140V) allele also showed a significant reduction compared to neurons expressing wild type MeCP2, supporting a cell-autonomous role for MeCP2 in neuronal development. IGF-1 (insulin growth factor-1) treatment of neuronal cells from Mecp2 mutant mice rescued the soma size phenotype. We also found that Mecp2\xa0 mutation leads to down-regulation of the mTOR signaling pathway, known to be involved in neuronal size regulation. Our results suggest that i) reduced neuronal size is an important in vitro cellular phenotype of Mecp2 mutation in mice, and ii) MeCP2 might play a critical role in the maintenance of neuronal structure by modulation of the mTOR pathway.

Data on previous pandemic influenza epidemiology was combined with data on the effectiveness of NAIs in reducing mortality obtained from a recent individual participant meta-analysis using observational data. Evidence synthesis techniques and a bias modelling method for observational data were used to incorporate the evidence into the model.

However, it may result in stone spilling, which potentially can lead to serious postoperative complications.\r\n\xa0\nCase report\r\nA 70-year-old male underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis. The procedure was complicated by perforation of the gallbladder and spilling of gallstones. More than a year after the procedure, the patient developed subcutaneous abscesses containing some of the spilled stones, a computed tomography revealed a complex intraabdominal and intrathoracic fistula with communication from the abdominal cavity to pleura and ultrasonic imaging found a lost gallstone in the thorax. After two years, the patient developed pleural empyema and sepsis secondary to the condition. Presently, the patient awaits surgery for the fistula and empyema.\r\n\xa0\nConclusion\r\nProper care should be taken to avoid stone spilling during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. However, if perforation and stone spilling occur, all visible stones should be removed during the procedure and the complication should be noted in the medical records. Furthermore, the patient should be thoroughly informed. This may help accelerate diagnosis if the patient later suffers from a complication related to lost stones.', u'/articles/5-2322/v1', ['Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases', 'Endocrinology & Gastroenterology'], [u'Center for Perioperative Optimization, Department of Surgery, Herlev Hospital, Herlev, Denmark', u'Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark', u'Department of Surgery, Herlev Hospital, Herlev, Denmark', u'Department of Surgery, Hvidovre Hospital, Hvidore, Denmark']]

However, researchers have demonstrated that PPG signals offer an alternative way of measuring HRV when electrocardiogram (ECG) and PPG signals are collected simultaneously. Based on these findings, we take the use of PPGs to the next step and investigate a different approach to show the potential independent use of short 20-second PPG signals collected from healthy subjects after exercise in a hot environment to measure HRV. Our hypothesis is that if the PPG--HRV indices are negatively correlated with age, then short PPG signals are appropriate measurements for extracting HRV parameters. The PPGs of 27 healthy male volunteers at rest and after exercise were used to determine the HRV indices: standard deviation of heartbeat interval (SDNN) and the root-mean square of the difference of successive heartbeats (RMSSD). The results indicate that the use of the $aa$ interval, derived from the acceleration of PPG signals, is promising in determining the HRV statistical indices SDNN and RMSSD over 20-second PPG recordings. Moreover, the post-exercise SDNN index shows a negative correlation with age. There tends to be a decrease of the PPG--SDNN index with increasing age, whether at rest or after exercise. This new outcome validates the negative relationship between HRV in general with age, and consequently provides another evidence that short PPG signals have the potential to be used in heart rate analysis without the need to measure lengthy sequences of either ECG or PPG signals.', u'/articles/5-2354/v1', ['Cardiopulmonary & Vascular Disorders', 'Public Health & Epidemiology'], [u'Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada', u'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada', u'Department of Computing Science, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada', u'National Critical Care and Trauma Response Centre, Darwin, Australia', u'Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia', u'School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia']]

We complement this selectionist picture by a proof-of-principle model of evolutionary search in the brain, that accounts for new variations in theory space. We present a model for Darwinian evolutionary search for candidate solutions in the brain.\nMethods: We combine known components of the brain \u2013 recurrent neural networks (acting as attractors), the action selection loop and implicit working memory \u2013 to provide the appropriate Darwinian architecture. We employ a population of attractor networks with palimpsest memory. The action selection loop is employed with winners-share-all dynamics to select for candidate solutions that are transiently stored in implicit working memory.\nResults: We document two processes: selection of stored solutions and evolutionary search for novel solutions. During the replication of candidate solutions attractor networks occasionally produce recombinant patterns, increasing variation on which selection can act. Combinatorial search acts on multiplying units (activity patterns) with hereditary variation and novel variants appear due to (i)\xa0noisy recall of patterns from the attractor networks, (ii)\xa0noise during transmission of candidate solutions as messages between networks, and, (iii)\xa0spontaneously generated, untrained patterns in spurious attractors.\nConclusions: Attractor dynamics of recurrent neural networks can be used to model Darwinian search. The proposed architecture can be used for fast search among stored solutions (by selection) and for evolutionary search when novel candidate solutions are generated in successive iterations. Since all the suggested components are present in advanced nervous systems, we hypothesize that the brain could implement a truly evolutionary combinatorial search system, capable of generating novel variants.', u'/articles/5-2416/v1', ['Eye Disorders & ENT', 'Development & Evolution', 'Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry'], [u'MTA-ELTE Theoretical Biology and Evolutionary Ecology Research Group, Budapest, H-1117, Hungary', u'Department of Plant Systematics, Ecology and Theoretical Biology, Institute of Biology, E\xf6tv\xf6s University, Budapest, H-1117, Hungary', u'Parmenides Center for the Conceptual Foundations of Science, Munich/Pullach, 82049, Germany', u'Institute of Advanced Studies, K\u0151szeg, H-9730, Hungary']]

Lack of expression of ER, PR and HER2/neu antigens was used to determine carcinomas that are among the TNEOC. We also compared the clinicopathological parameters (age, International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage, grade and histological subtype) in patients with TNEOC and non- TNEOC\xa0.\n\nResults: Thirty-eight (42.2%) of the 90 tumours diagnosed as EOC were negative for ER, PR and HER2/neu expression. There was no significant association between TNEOC with other parameters such as age, FIGO stage and histological grade. Sixteen (66.7%) of the 24 mucinous carcinomas were triple negative, while only 21 (33.3%) of the 63 serous carcinomas were triple-negative and one (50%) of the two endometrioid carcinomas was triple negative. There was a significant association between triple-negative tumours and histological subtypes of EOC (p = 0.034).\n\nConclusions: A subtype of epithelial ovarian cancer that is negative for ER, PR and HER-2/neu has been discovered in indigenous African women. TNEOC expression is high and is comparable to the triple negative breast cancer subtype seen in people of African ancestry.

Their beneficial impacts on human health relate predominantly to their capacity to serve as antioxidants, thus protecting cells against the damaging impact of reactive oxygen species. Recent studies have also pointed at an essential role for flavonoids as antioxidants in plants.\nResults: Here we show that the flavonoid quercetin, which is known to protect human cells from oxidative stress, has the same effect on plant cells. Under oxidative stress conditions, Arabidopsis plants grown on quercetin-supplemented media grew better than controls and contained less oxidized proteins. This protection was also observed in the dicot Nicotiana tabacum and the aquatic monocot Lemna gibba.\nConclusion: Quercetin can be used as a general antioxidant stress protectant for plants.', u'/articles/5-2430/v1', ['Plant Biology, Ecology & Environmental Sciences'], [u'Plant Physiology, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology Program, Department of Plant and Soil Sciences, University of Kentucky, Lexington, 40546, USA']]

Recent studies indicate that Lunasin has several distinct potential modes of action including suppressing integrin signaling and epigenetic effects driven by modulation of histone acetylation.

Common colors range between white and brown, with darker dogwhelks being more affected by heat stress than lighter-colored conspecifics. Other reported shell colors are black, mauve, pink, yellow, and orange from European coasts, red and grey from the Bay of Fundy coast of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia (Canada), and purple, black, gray, yellow, and orange from the coasts of Maine and Massachusetts (USA), with purple being considered as a rare color. On the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia, dogwhelks are active from April until November, but information on dogwhelk shell color is missing for this coast. On 16 June 2016, we found two purple dogwhelks in the mid-to-high intertidal zone of a moderately wave-exposed rocky shore near Duncans\xa0Cove, on the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia while collecting dogwhelks (n= 1000) for manipulative field experiments. All other dogwhelks collected on that day were of common white and brown colors. During earlier dogwhelk collections in Atlantic Nova Scotia (between 2011-2013) and field surveys in Duncans Cove (between 2014-2016), we did not find any purple dogwhelks, indicating the rareness of this color in that region.

Kv4.2 channels modulate excitability in the dendrites of pyramidal neurons in the cortex and hippocampus. Deletion of Kv4.2 results in spatial learning and conditioned fear deficits; however, previous studies have only examined deletion of Kv4.2 in aversive learning tests.\nMethods: For the current study, we used the Lashley maze as an appetitive learning test. We examined Kv4.2 wildtype (WT) and knockout (KO) mice in the Lashley maze over 4 days during adulthood. The first day consisted of habituating the mice to the maze. The mice then received five trials per day for the next 3 days. The number of errors and the time to the goal box was recorded for each trial. The goal box contained a weigh boat with an appetitive reward (gelatin with sugar). There was an intertrial interval of 15 minutes.\nResults: We found that Kv4.2 KO mice committed more errors across the trials compared to the WT mice p<0.001. There was no difference in the latency to find the goal box over the period.\nDiscussion: Our finding that deletion of Kv4.2 resulted in more errors in the Lashley maze across 15 trials contribute to a growing body of evidence that Kv4.2 channels are significantly involved in learning and memory.', u'/articles/5-2456/v1', ['Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry'], [u'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Baylor University, Waco, TX, 76798, USA', u'Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, Baylor University, Waco, TX, 76798, USA']]

A large body of work coupled with recent technological advances in genome research have at last started to provide some of the answers. Initially this review seeks to explain and to differentiate between bowel inflammation in the primary immunodeficiencies that generally lead to very early onset diffuse bowel inflammation in humans and in animal models, and the real syndrome of CD. In the latter, a trigger, almost certainly enteric infection by one of a multitude of organisms, allows the faeces access to the tissues, at which stage the response of individuals predisposed to CD is abnormal. Direct investigation of patients\u2019 inflammatory response together with genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and DNA sequencing indicate that in CD the failure of acute inflammation and the clearance of bacteria from the tissues, and from within cells, is defective.

Opiates usually become less effective over time. In many, their persistent pain occurs after the healing of a soft tissue injury. Current animal models of neuropathic pain typically create direct neural damage with open surgeries using ligatures, neurectomies, chemicals or other forms of deliberate trauma. However, we have observed clinically that after an injury in humans, the naturally occurring process of tissue repair can cause chronic neural pain.\r\n\xa0\nMethods: We demonstrate how the refined biomimetic NeuroDigm GEL\u2122 Model, in the mature male rat, gradually induces neuropathic pain behavior with a nonsurgical percutaneous implant of tissue-derived hydrogel in the musculo-fascial tunnel of the distal tibial nerve. Morphine, Celecoxib, Gabapentin and Duloxetine were each screened in the model three times each over 5 months after pain behaviors developed. A pilot study followed in which recombinant human erythropoietin was applied to the GEL neural procedure site.\r\n\xa0\nResults: The GEL Model gradually developed neuropathic pain behavior lasting months. Morphine, initially effective, had less analgesia over time. Celecoxib produced no analgesia, while gabapentin and duloxetine at low doses had profound analgesia at all times tested. The injected erythropoietin markedly decreased bilateral pain behavior that had been present for over 4 months. Histology revealed a site of focal neural remodeling, with neural regeneration, as in human biopsies.\r\n\xa0\nConclusion: The refined NeuroDigm GEL\u2122 Model induces localized neural remodeling resulting in robust neuropathic pain behavior.

This scenario becomes potentially catastrophic when the global burden of Dengue and the advent of the newly approved anti-Dengue vaccines in the near future are taken into account. Thus, antiviral chemotherapy should be pursued as a priority strategy to control the spread of the virus and prevent the complications associated with Zika.\nMethods\r\nHere we describe a fast and reliable cell-based, high-content screening assay for discovery of anti-ZIKV compounds.

[u'Puzzles in modern biology. IV. Neurodegeneration, localized origin and widespread decay', ['Steven A. Frank'], u'19 Oct 2016', u'The motor neuron disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) typically begins with localized muscle weakness. Progressive, widespread paralysis often follows over a few years. Does the disease begin with local changes in a small piece of neural tissue and then spread? Or does neural decay happen independently across diverse spatial locations? The distinction matters, because local initiation may arise by local changes in a tissue microenvironment, by somatic mutation, or by various epigenetic or regulatory fluctuations in a few cells. A local trigger must be coupled with a mechanism for spread. By contrast, independent decay across spatial locations cannot begin by a local change, but must depend on some global predisposition or spatially distributed change that leads to approximately synchronous decay. This article outlines the conceptual frame by which one contrasts local triggers and spread versus parallel spatially distributed decay. Various neurodegenerative diseases differ in their mechanistic details, but all can usefully be understood as falling along a continuum of interacting local and global processes. Cancer provides an example of disease progression by local triggers and spatial spread, setting a conceptual basis for clarifying puzzles in neurodegeneration. Heart disease also has crucial interactions between global processes, such as circulating lipid levels, and local processes in the development of atherosclerotic plaques.

There were minor differences in test responses between the initial test and the re-test 48 hours later. We found that the PostopQRS questionnaire has some background noise; 12 out of 61 participants (20%) reported mild pain, 25 (41%) scored some depression and 33 scored mild anxiety (54%). The cognitive domain showed a learning effect between tests in \u201cword recall\u201d and \u201cword generation\u201d, while \u201cdigit recall forward\u201d and \u201cdigit recall backward\u201d showed no change.

This was motivated by an expectation that a better understanding of the spontaneous shifts in seizure-activity that are observed in some cases should reduce the risk of over-treatment caused by inappropriate changes in medication.\n\nMethods\r\nThe analyses were performed using Poisson hidden Markov models (HMMs), both Bayesian and non-Bayesian, implemented using Markov chain Monte Carlo and the expectation-maximisation algorithm, respectively. A defining feature of the models, as applied to epilepsy, is the assumed existence of two or more pathological states, with state-specific Poisson rates, and random transitions between the states. Posterior predictive simulation was used to assess the validity of the Bayesian HMMs.\n\nResults\r\nThe results are presented in the form of state transition probability and Poisson rate estimates (i.e., the primary HMM parameters), together with information derived from these primary parameters. State-specific mean-duration (sojourn time) estimates and sojourn-time complementary cumulative probability distributions are the main focus. HMM analyses are presented for three children that differed markedly in their seizure behaviour. The first is characterised by an extreme seizure count on one occasion; the second underwent a spontaneous decrease in seizure activity during the observation period; the third seizure-count time trajectory is characterised by a gradual change in mean seizure activity. We show that, despite their considerable differences, each of the observed seizure-count trajectories can be treated adequately using an HMM.\n\nConclusions\r\nThe study demonstrates that clinically relevant information can be obtained using HM modelling in three cases with markedly different seizure behaviour.

[u'Complete genome of Pieris rapae, a resilient alien, a cabbage pest, and a source of anti-cancer proteins', ['Jinhui Shen', 'Qian Cong', 'Lisa N. Kinch', 'Dominika Borek', 'Zbyszek Otwinowski', 'Nick V. Grishin'], u'03 Nov 2016', u'The Small Cabbage White (Pieris rapae) is originally a Eurasian butterfly. Being accidentally introduced into North America, Australia, and New Zealand a century or more ago, it spread throughout the continents and rapidly established as one of the most abundant butterfly species. Although it is a serious pest of cabbage and other mustard family plants with its caterpillars reducing crops to stems, it is also a source of pierisin, a protein unique to the Whites that shows cytotoxicity to cancer cells. To better understand the unusual biology of this omnipresent agriculturally and medically important butterfly, we sequenced and annotated the complete genome from USA specimens. At 246 Mbp, it is among the smallest Lepidoptera genomes reported to date. While 1.5% positions in the genome are heterozygous, they are distributed highly non-randomly along the scaffolds, and nearly 20% of longer than 1000 base-pair segments are SNP-free (median length: 38000 bp). Computational simulations of population evolutionary history suggest that American populations started from a very small number of introduced individuals, possibly a single fertilized female, which is in agreement with historical literature. Comparison to other Lepidoptera genomes reveals several unique families of proteins that may contribute to the unusual resilience of Pieris. The nitrile-specifier proteins divert the plant defense chemicals to non-toxic products. The apoptosis-inducing pierisins could offer a defense mechanism against parasitic wasps. While only two pierisins from Pieris rapae were characterized before, the genome sequence revealed eight, offering additional candidates as anti-cancer drugs.

[u'Design of chemical space networks incorporating compound distance relationships', ['Antonio de la Vega de Leon', 'Jurgen Bajorath'], u'04 Nov 2016', u'Networks, in which nodes represent compounds and edges pairwise similarity relationships, are used as coordinate-free representations of chemical space. So-called chemical space networks (CSNs) provide intuitive access to structural relationships within compound data sets and can be annotated with activity information. However, in such similarity-based networks, distances between compounds are typically determined for layout purposes and clarity and have no chemical meaning. By contrast, inter-compound distances as a measure of dissimilarity can be directly obtained from coordinate-based representations of chemical space. Herein, we introduce a CSN variant that incorporates compound distance relationships and thus further increases the information content of compound networks. The design was facilitated by adapting the Kamada-Kawai algorithm.

[u'Intensive nutritional counselling obviates a weight gain in kidney transplant recipients with long-term graft survival in Estonia', ['Liidia Kiisk', 'Mai Ots-Rosenberg'], u'10 Nov 2016', u'Background. After kidney transplantation body weight gain (WG) in patients generally increases and this can be influenced by improved appetite and reversal of the uremic state. Because of a lack of evidence for effective interventions that prevent body WG after kidney transplantation, Ryan et al. recently published a randomized controlled trial design in BMC Nephrology to assess the effects of intensive nutrition interventions on WG and metabolic parameters. Here we are demonstrating a part of a study performed at our transplantation centre where we also performed an intensive nutritional counselling intervention on kidney recipients. We hypothesised that kidney transplant (KTx) patients who received intensive counselling may have better long-term weight control compared with patients who did not receive such counselling.\nMethods. During intensive counselling the dietician took into consideration the results of anthropometry, densitometry, biochemistry, food frequency questionnaire and an analysis of 3-day dietary records. Anthropometrical measurements were assessed at 18 months, 36 months, and, finally, 10 years after the kidney transplantation.\nResults. We noticed WG in all KTx patients (n=56) both in males and females, as follows: in the standard care group the mean WG in males (N=21) was 6.4 kg, females (N=15) 7.0 kg and among intensively counselled males (N=9) 4.6 kg, females (N=11) 1.1 kg.\xa0 Statistically non-significant weight change was found among counselled living KTx patients with long-term graft survival both in males (p=0.0680) and females ( p=0.3166) which was registered 10 years after the KTx compared with the first measurement mean weight. Among standard care control KTx patients, weight change was statistically significant in both males and females (males: p=0.0016; females:\xa0 p=0.0040) 10 years after the KTx.\nConclusions. The long-term WG data clearly showed that in our population of KT patients, the patients who received intensive individual dietary counselling had much more educated behaviour in the long-term, thereby preventing WG which is a well-known risk factor for long-term graft failure as well as for cardiovascular complications and mortality.', u'/articles/5-2658/v1', ['Hepatology & Nephrology'], [u'Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Tartu University, Tartu, 51014, Estonia']]

This paper aims to use a multidimensional approach to well-being to explore the immediately experienced and later remembered well-being of environmental volunteers and to compare this to the increased well-being of participants in other types of nature-based activities and volunteering. Furthermore, it aims to compare volunteer managers\u2019 perceptions of their volunteers\u2019 well-being with the self-reported well-being of the volunteers. Methods: Onsite surveys were conducted of practical conservation and biodiversity monitoring volunteers, as well as their control groups (walkers and fieldwork students, respectively), to measure general well-being before their nature-based activity and activity-related well-being immediately after their activity. Online surveys of current, former and potential volunteers and volunteer managers measured remembered volunteering-related well-being and managers\u2019 perceptions of their volunteers\u2019 well-being. Data were analysed based on Seligman\u2019s multidimensional PERMA (\u2018positive emotion\u2019, \u2018engagement\u2019, \u2018positive relationship\u2019, \u2018meaning\u2019, \u2018achievement\u2019) model of well-being.

The aim of this study was to assess the cost-utility of once-daily (QD) versus twice-daily (BID) antiretroviral (ART) regimens in the treatment of HIV.\xa0METHODS: A Model-based Markov modelling of cost-effectiveness using secondary data sources was developed to determine the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained of QD versus BID ART regimen for a hypothetical cohort treatment-na\xefve adults with HIV, from the Sub-Saharan African healthcare payer\u2019s perspective.\xa0RESULTS: At base-case values for all parameters, the total number of QALY gained by QD regimen was 0.27 and the incremental cost difference of $2147.04. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of QD versus BID regimen was $8087/QALY gained. The ICER was most sensitive to the variations in the total medical cost of state A (asymptomatic, non-AIDS, CD4> 350 cells/\u03bcL), total medical Cost State D (symptomatic AIDS or severe symptoms), and utility of State A. In our bootstrap analysis, 60% of bootstrap replicates for the ICER shows that QD is more costly and more effective than BID regimen, while the remaining 40% replicates shows that QD is less costly and less effective than BID. If decision-makers were willing to pay $1000 per QALY gained, the probability of QD being cost-effective was 44%. The probability of QD regimen being cost-effective was 48% when the willing to pay was $5000.\xa0CONCLUSIONS: From a sub-Saharan Africa societal perspective QD regimen cannot be regarded as cost-effective, although there is substantial decision uncertainty.

[u'An ensemble-based Cox proportional hazards regression framework for predicting survival in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients', ['Richard Meier', 'Stefan Graw', 'Joseph Usset', 'Rama Raghavan', 'Junqiang Dai', 'Prabhakar Chalise', 'Shellie Ellis', 'Brooke Fridley', 'Devin Koestler'], u'16 Nov 2016', u'From March through August 2015, nearly 60 teams from around the world participated in the Prostate Cancer Dream Challenge (PCDC). Participating teams were faced with the task of developing prediction models for patient survival and treatment discontinuation using baseline clinical variables collected on metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients in the comparator arm of four phase III clinical trials. In total, over 2,000 mCRPC patients treated with first-line docetaxel comprised the training and testing data sets used in this challenge. In this paper we describe: (a) the sub-challenges comprising the PCDC, (b) the statistical metrics used to benchmark prediction performance, (c) our analytical approach, and finally (d) our team\u2019s overall performance in this challenge. Specifically, we discuss our curated, ad-hoc, feature selection (CAFS) strategy for identifying clinically important risk-predictors, the ensemble-based Cox proportional hazards regression framework used in our final submission, and the adaptation of our modeling framework based on the results from the intermittent leaderboard rounds. Strong predictors of patient survival were successfully identified utilizing our model building approach. Several of the identified predictors were new features created by our team via strategically merging collections of weak predictors. In each of the three intermittent leaderboard rounds, our prediction models scored among the top four models across all participating teams and our final submission ranked 9th place overall with an integrated area under the curve (iAUC) of 0.7711 computed in an independent test set. While the prediction performance of teams placing between 2nd- 10th (iAUC: 0.7710-0.7789) was better than the current gold-standard prediction model for prostate cancer survival, the top-performing team, FIMM-UTU significantly outperformed all other contestants with an iAUC of 0.7915.\xa0 In summary, our ensemble-based Cox regression framework with CAFS resulted in strong overall performance for predicting prostate cancer survival and represents a promising approach for future prediction problems.', u'/articles/5-2677/v1', ['Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'Department of Biostatistic, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS, USA', u'Department of Health Policy and Management, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS, USA']]

McDowell'], u'17 Nov 2016', u'Background: On December 1 2016, the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) will be updated by the U.S. Department of Labor. The key changes are an increase in the salary threshold for exemption from overtime for working more than 40 hours per week, and indexing the salary level so that it is updated automatically every 3 years. This update is predicted to have a profound effect on the academic enterprise as a large proportion of the postdoctoral researcher population is currently paid at a salary below the new threshold for exemption. Here we review the key changes to the FLSA, how they came about, and how the postdoctoral population is affected by the ruling.\nMethods: We describe recent data collection efforts (checking university websites and contacting HR departments) to uncover what institutions in the 2014 NSF Survey of Graduate Students and Postdoctorates in Science and Engineering are doing to comply with the FLSA ruling for postdocs.\nResults: Our data show that 41% of the estimated postdoctoral workforce in STEM and 57% of institutions checked have not decided or have no public decision yet available one month prior to implementation, and only 35.5% of institutions are planning to raise salaries to the new minimum.\nConclusions: Our data show the uncertainty of postdoc salaries in the U.S. one month prior to implementation of the FLSA ruling.

MAKER-P and YeATSAM both failed to annotate several hundred proteins found by the other. Although many of these unannotated proteins have repetitive sequences (possibly transposable elements), other crucial proteins were excluded by each method. An egg cell-secreted protein and a homer protein were undetected by YeATSAM, although these did not produce any transcripts. Importantly, MAKER-P failed to classify key photosynthesis-related proteins, which we show emanated from Trinity assembly artifacts potentially not handled by MAKER-P. Also, no proteins from the large berberine bridge enzyme (BBE) family were annotated by MAKER-P. BBE is implicated in biosynthesis of several alkaloids metabolites, like anti-microbial berberine. As further validation, YeATSAM identified ~1000 genes that are not annotated in the NCBI database by Gnomon. YeATSAM used a RNA-seq derived chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) transcriptome assembled using Newbler v2.3.\xa0Conclusions:\xa0Since the current version of YeATSAM does not have an ab initio module, we suggest a combined annotation scheme using both MAKER-P and YeATSAM to comprehensively and accurately annotate the WGS.', u'/articles/5-2689/v1', ['Plant Biology, Ecology & Environmental Sciences'], [u'Department of Plant Sciences, University of California, Davis, USA']]

In 2013, the National Health Security Office of Thailand introduced P4P, based on the UK Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF), as a mandatory programme for primary care providers. This study aims to review the first year of the Thai QOF policy, focusing on the key features of its formulation and implementation stages.\xa0Methods.This study used a mix of data collection approaches, such as literature review, in-depth interviews with QOF managers, and focus-group discussions with health officers and practitioners. Data were collected between June and August 2015 and transcribed and analysed using qualitative content analysis (interpretation of the content of text data through the systematic classification process of identifying themes or patterns). Two consultation meetings were organised to verify the preliminary findings.\xa0Results.\xa0Based on the UK model, the Thai QOF was formulated without formal consultation with key stakeholders. Additionally, programme managers adopted a \u2018learning by doing\u2019 approach, since Thai authorities were already aware of health system limitations, such as insufficient human and financial resources and unreliable databases. There were also problems with QOF implementation, as follows: 1) deducting the budget from the annual payment for ambulatory care made the policy unjustified because providers did not receive full subsidisation of their service delivery; 2) lack of key stakeholder engagement resulted in miscommunication, and subsequently misunderstanding and inadequate coordination, for the translation of QOF policy into action; and 3) the unreliability of the IT system led to inaccurately-reported data on service delivery, thereby adversely affecting performance.\xa0Conclusion.There is still room for improvement in formulating and implementing the Thai QOF programme.

[u'Dimension reduction of Malaria Box data allows efficient compound prioritization', ['Gajinder Pal Singh'], u'18 Nov 2016', u'Background: New anti-malarial drugs are needed to meet the challenge of artemisinin resistance and to achieve malaria elimination and eradication. The new anti-malarial compounds are expected to have many desirable properties, such as activity against multiple stages of Plasmodium, low host cytotoxicity, and low propensity for resistance development, but whether and how these properties might be linked to each other is not clear. A better understanding of the relationship between activities of compounds against different stages of Plasmodium could help in the development of strategies to prioritize compounds with maximum potential for further development.\xa0Methods: We utilized the large amount of data that has recently been generated on 400 anti-malarial Malaria Box compounds and performed statistical analyses, such as rank correlation, hierarchical clustering, and principal-component analyses, to test associations between activities against different stages of Plasmodium, other pathogens, and human cells.\xa0Results: We found significant positive correlations between the activities of compounds against different stages of Plasmodium. Our results also show toxicity associated with assays conducted at higher compound concentrations. Principal-component analyses (PCA) of the data allowed differentiation of Plasmodium-specific activity from general toxicity and predicted success in in vitro evolution of resistance. We found that a single principal-component can capture most of the desirable properties of Malaria Box compounds and can be used to rank compounds from most desirable to least desirable activity-profile.\xa0Conclusions: Here, we provide a systematic strategy to prioritize Malaria Box compounds for further development. This approach may be applied for prioritization of anti-malarial compounds in general.', u'/articles/5-2701/v1', ['Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'Molecular Medicine Group, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB), New Delhi, India']]
[u'Electroantennogram response of the parasitoid, Microplitis croceipes to host-related odors: The discrepancy between relative abundance and level of antennal responses to volatile compound', ['Tolulope Morawo', 'Matthew Burrows', 'Henry Fadamiro'], u'21 Nov 2016', u'Herbivores emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs) after feeding on plants. Parasitoids exploit these VOCs as odor cues to locate their hosts. In nature, host-related odors are emitted as blends of various compounds occurring in different proportions, and minor blend components can sometimes have profound effects on parasitoid responses. In a previous related study, we identified and quantified VOCs emitted by cotton plant-fed Heliothis virescens\xa0(Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) larvae, an herbivore host of the parasitoid Microplitis croceipes\xa0(Hymenoptera: Braconidae). In the present study, the olfactory response of female M. croceipes to synthetic versions of 15 previously identified compounds was tested in electroantennogram (EAG) bioassays. Using M. croceipes as a model species, we further asked the question: does the relative abundance of a volatile compound match the level of antennal response in parasitoids? Female M. croceipes showed varying EAG responses to test compounds, indicating different levels of bioactivity in the insect antenna. Eight compounds, including decanal, 1-octen-3-ol, 3-octanone, 2-ethylhexanol, tridecane, tetradecane, \u03b1-farnesene and bisabolene, elicited EAG responses above or equal to the 50th percentile rank of all responses. Interestingly, decanal, which represented only 1% of the total amount of odors emitted by cotton-fed hosts, elicited the highest (0.82 mV) EAG response in parasitoids. On the other hand, (E)-\u03b2-caryophyllene, the most abundant (29%) blend component, elicited a relatively low (0.17 mV) EAG response. The results suggest that EAG response to host-related volatiles in parasitoids is probably more influenced by the ecological relevance or functional role of the compound in the blend, rather than its relative abundance.', u'/articles/5-2725/v1', ['Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases', 'Plant Biology, Ecology & Environmental Sciences'], [u'Department of Entomology & Plant Pathology, Auburn University, Auburn, USA', u'Division of Parasitic Diseases and Malaria- Entomology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, USA']]

Mobilization of bone marrow-origin CD34+ cells was investigated 3 days (3d) after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with/without ischemic preconditioning (IP) in relation to stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1\u03b1)/ chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) axis, to search for possible mechanisms behind insufficient cardiac repair in the first days post-AMI.\xa0Methods. Closed-chest reperfused AMI was performed by percutaneous balloon occlusion of the mid-left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery for 90min, followed by reperfusion in pigs. Animals were randomized to receive either IP initiated by 3x5min cycles of re-occlusion/re-flow prior to AMI (n=6) or control AMI (n=12). Blood samples were collected at baseline, 3d post-AMI, and at 1-month follow-up to analyse chemokines and mobilized CD34+ cells. To investigate the effect of acute hypoxia, SDF-1\u03b1 and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 in vitro were assessed, and a migration assay of CD34+ cells toward cardiomyocytes was performed.\xa0Results. Reperfused AMI induced significant mobilisation of CD34+ cells (baseline: 260\xb175 vs. 3d: 668\xb1180; P<0.001) and secretion of MMP-2 (baseline: 291.83\xb153.40 vs. 3d: 369.64\xb172.89; P=0.011) into plasma, without affecting the SDF-1\u03b1 concentration. IP led to the inhibition of MMP-2 (IP: 165.67\xb147.99 vs. AMI: 369.64\xb172.89; P=0.004) 3d post-AMI, accompanied by increased release of SDF-1\u03b1 (baseline: 23.80\xb112.36 vs. 3d: 45.29\xb111.31; P=0.05) and CXCR4 (baseline: 0.59\xb10.16 vs. 3d: 2.06\xb11.42; P=0.034), with a parallel higher level of mobilisation of CD34+ cells (IP: 881\xb1126 vs. AMI: 668\xb1180; P=0.026), compared to non-conditioned AMI. In vitro, CD34+ cell migration toward cardiomyocytes was enhanced by SDF-1\u03b1, which was completely abolished by 90min hypoxia and co-incubation with MMP-2.\xa0Conclusions. Non-conditioned AMI induces MMP-2 release, hampering the ischemia-induced increase in SDF-1\u03b1 and CXCR4 by cleaving the SDF-1\u03b1/CXCR4 axis, with diminished mobilization of the angiogenic CD34+ cells.

[u'Communicating behavioral genetics: Charting the limits of the genetic interpolation effect', ['Alexandre Morin-Chasse'], u'22 Nov 2016', u'Background: Scientific research has linked genetic predispositions to complex social behaviors and orientations. Recent empirical work in science communication suggests that the dissemination of these research findings can impact on public beliefs about the influence of genetics. The genetic interpolation hypothesis posits that exposure to this type of news causes the public to update their views about the influence of genetics on human beings and to infer greater genetic causation for other social traits that are not mentioned in the news content. The main purpose of this study is to test whether the genetic interpolation effect also emerges following exposure to a soft treatment: a short summary paragraph rather than a real news article. It also tests if specifying that a particular gene has a marginal effect succeeds at moderating the genetic interpolation effect. Finally, the study tests a counter-hypothesis: instead of resulting from belief updating, the genetic interpolation effect is triggered by the simple act of thinking about genetics shortly before reporting beliefs. Methods: In total, 2080 respondents were recruited from a pre-existing online panel and were randomly split into four experimental groups: group 1) no message; group 2) a paragraph about how genes can impact on voting behavior; group 3) the same paragraph as group 2, plus an indication that the effect of a particular gene is small; group 4) a paragraph about how genetics impact on physical traits such as eye color. Subjects were then asked to evaluate the role of genetics in causing three traits: voting at election; intelligence; and natural hair style (curly or straight). Results: The analyses reveal no evidence supporting the genetic interpolation hypothesis, the moderation hypothesis or the counter-hypothesis. Conclusion: Overall, the results suggest that exposure to a paragraph describing how genes can impact on complex social behavior is not sufficient to trigger the genetic interpolation effect.', u'/articles/5-2744/v1', ['Publishing, Education & Communication', 'Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry'], [u'Universit\xe9 de Montr\xe9al, Montr\xe9al, Canada']]

Several methods were proposed to answer biological questions interrogating these networks. Differential co-expression analysis is a recent approach that measures how gene interactions change when a biological system transitions from one state to another. Although the importance of differentially co-expressed genes to identify dysregulated pathways has been noted, their role in gene regulation is not well studied. Herein we investigated differentially co-expressed genes in a relatively simple mono-causal process (B lymphocyte deficiency) and in a complex multi-causal system (cervical cancer).\r\nMethods: Co-expression networks of B cell deficiency (Control and BcKO) were reconstructed using Pearson correlation coefficient for two mus musculus datasets: B10.A strain (12 normal, 12 BcKO) and BALB/c strain (10 normal, 10 BcKO). Co-expression networks of cervical cancer (normal and cancer) were reconstructed using local partial correlation method for five datasets (total of 64 normal, 148 cancer). Differentially correlated pairs were identified along with the location of their genes in BcKO and in cancer networks. Minimum Shortest Path and Bi-partite Betweenness Centrality where statistically evaluated for differentially co-expressed genes in corresponding networks.\xa0 \xa0\r\nResults: We show that in B cell deficiency the differentially co-expressed genes are highly enriched with immunoglobulin genes (causal genes). In cancer we found that differentially co-expressed genes act as \u201cbottlenecks\u201d rather than causal drivers with most flows that come from the key driver genes to the peripheral genes passing through differentially co-expressed genes. Using in vitro knockdown experiments for two out of 14 differentially co-expressed genes found in cervical cancer (FGFR2 and CACYBP), we showed that they play regulatory roles in cancer cell growth.\r\nConclusion: Identifying differentially co-expressed genes in co-expression networks is an important tool in detecting regulatory genes involved in alterations of phenotype.', u'/articles/5-2740/v1', ['Oncology & Hematology', 'Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology', 'Urology, Gynecology & Obstetrics'], [u'Instituto de Matem\xe1tica e Estat\xedstica, Universidade de S\xe3o Paulo, S\xe3o Paulo, Brazil', u'College of Pharmacy, Oregon State University, Corvallis, USA', u'College of Veterinary Medicine, Oregon State University, Corvallis, USA']]

[u'Dynamics of tRNA fragments and their targets in aging mammalian brain', ['Spyros Karaiskos', 'Andrey Grigoriev'], u'24 Nov 2016', u"Background:\xa0The progress of next-generation sequencing technologies has unveiled various non-coding RNAs that have previously been considered products of random degradation and attracted only minimal interest. Among small RNA families, microRNA (miRNAs) have traditionally been considered key post-transcriptional regulators. However, recent studies have reported evidence for widespread presence of fragments of tRNA molecules (tRFs) across a range of organisms and tissues, and of tRF involvement in Argonaute complexes.\xa0Methods:To elucidate potential tRF functionality, we compared available RNA sequencing datasets derived from the brains of young, mid-aged and old rats. Using sliding 7-mer windows along a tRF, we searched for putative seed sequences with high numbers of conserved complementary sites within 3' UTRs of 23 vertebrate genomes. We analyzed Gene Ontology term enrichment of predicted tRF targets and compared their transcript levels with targets of miRNAs in the context of age.\xa0Results and Discussion:\xa0We detected tRFs originating from 3\u2019- and 5\u2019-ends of tRNAs in rat brains at significant levels. These fragments showed dynamic changes: 3\u2019 tRFs monotonously increased with age, while 5\u2019 tRFs displayed less consistent patterns. Furthermore, 3\u2019 tRFs showed a narrow size range compared to 5\u2019 tRFs, suggesting a difference in their biogenesis mechanisms. Similar to our earlier results in Drosophila and compatible with other experimental findings, we found \u201cseed\u201d sequence locations on both ends of different tRFs. Putative targets of these fragments were found to be enriched in neuronal and developmental functions.

We found that there was a five-fold higher preference for AT nucleotides compared to GC nucleotides at synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism sites in P. vivax. The preference for AT nucleotides was also present at non-synonymous sites, which lead to amino acid changes favouring those with codons of higher AT content.

[u'Optimal threshold estimation for binary classifiers using game theory', ['Ignacio Enrique Sanchez'], u'25 Nov 2016', u'Many bioinformatics algorithms can be understood as binary classifiers. They are usually trained by maximizing the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. On the other hand, choosing the best threshold for practical use is a complex task, due to uncertain and context-dependent skews in the abundance of positives in nature and in the yields/costs for correct/incorrect classification. We argue that considering a classifier as a player in a zero-sum game allows us to use the minimax principle from game theory to determine the optimal operating point. The proposed classifier threshold corresponds to the intersection between the ROC curve and the descending diagonal in ROC space and yields a minimax accuracy of 1-FPR. Our proposal can be readily implemented in practice, and reveals that the empirical condition for threshold estimation of \u201cspecificity equals sensitivity\u201d maximizes robustness against uncertainties in the abundance of positives in nature and classification costs.', u'/articles/5-2762/v1', ['Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'Protein Physiology Laboratory, University of Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina']]
[u'Early embryo mortality in natural human reproduction: What the data say', ['Gavin E. Jarvis'], u'25 Nov 2016', u'It is generally accepted that natural human embryo mortality during pregnancy is high \u2013 losses of 70% and higher from fertilisation to birth are frequently claimed. The first external sign of pregnancy occurs two weeks after fertilisation with a missed menstrual period. Establishing the fate of embryos before this is challenging, and hampered by a lack of data on the efficiency of fertilisation under natural conditions. Four distinct sources are cited to justify quantitative claims regarding embryo loss: (i) a hypothesis published by Roberts & Lowe in The Lancet \xa0is widely cited but has no quantitative value; (ii) life table analyses give consistent assessments of clinical pregnancy loss, but cannot illuminate losses at earlier stages of development; (iii) studies that measure human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) reveal losses in the second week of development and beyond, but not before; and (iv) the classic studies of Hertig and Rock offer the only direct insight into the fate of human embryos from fertilisation under natural conditions. Re-examination of Hertig\u2019s data demonstrates that his estimates for fertilisation rate and early embryo loss are highly imprecise and casts doubt on the validity of his numerical analysis. A recent re-analysis of hCG study data suggests that approximately 40-60% of embryos may be lost between fertilisation and birth, although this will vary substantially between individual women. In conclusion, it is clear that some published estimates of natural embryo mortality are exaggerated. Although available data do not provide a precise estimate, natural human embryo mortality is lower than is often claimed.', u'/articles/5-2765/v1', ['Urology, Gynecology & Obstetrics'], [u'Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB2 3EG, UK']]

It effects approximately 2-6% of the general population and disproportionately impacts up to 65% of patients over 65. This study compared a new cerumen (earwax) removal product (Solution 1; EOS-002; a glycolic acid/bicarbonate formulation) versus two commercially available products (Solution 2 and Solution 3; both containing carbamide peroxide 6.5%) for their cerumenolytic activity in vitro.\xa0Methods: Samples of human cerumen were placed in 10 x 75 mm polypropylene test tubes. Approximately 1 mL of each test solution was added and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. The vials were shaken at the 15- and 30-minute time points to simulate rinsing in a clinical setting. Breakdown of the cerumen was graded at 5-, 10-, 15-, and 30-minute time points in a masked manner on a 5-point scale (Grade 0 = no change; Grade 4 = complete disintegration).\xa0Results: Significantly greater disintegration of the cerumen was observed in the samples exposed to EOS-002 at every time point (P < 0.0001). At 5 minutes, disintegration was observed in 39 out of 43 samples exposed to EOS-002, 0 out of 24 samples exposed to Solution 2, and 1 out of 19 samples exposed to Solution 3. Mean disintegration scores at 5, 10, 15, and 30 minutes were 1.65, 2.38, 2.95, and 3.24 for EOS-002; 0, 0, 0, and 0.2 for Solution 2; and 0.05, 0.13, 0.16, and 0.21 for Solution 3, respectively.\xa0Discussion: EOS-002 exhibited a significantly greater ability to breakdown cerumen than the two other products.

[u'Recapitulating phylogenies using k-mers: from trees to networks', ['Guillaume Bernard', 'Mark A. Ragan', 'Cheong Xin Chan'], u'29 Nov 2016', u'Ernst Haeckel based his landmark Tree of Life on the supposed ontogenic recapitulation of phylogeny, i.e. that successive embryonic stages during the development of an organism re-trace the morphological forms of its ancestors over the course of evolution. Much of this idea has since been discredited. Today, phylogenies are often based on molecular sequences. A typical phylogenetic inference aims to capture and represent, in the form of a tree, the evolutionary history of a family of molecular sequences. The standard approach starts with a multiple sequence alignment, in which the sequences are arranged relative to each other in a way that maximises a measure of similarity position-by-position along their entire length. However, this approach ignores important evolutionary processes that are known to shape the genomes of microbes (bacteria, archaea and some morphologically simple eukaryotes). Recombination, genome rearrangement and lateral genetic transfer undermine the assumptions that underlie multiple sequence alignment, and imply that a tree-like structure may be too simplistic. Here, using genome sequences of 143 bacterial and archaeal genomes, we construct a network of phylogenetic relatedness based on the number of shared k-mers (subsequences at fixed length k). Our findings suggest that the network captures not only key aspects of microbial genome evolution as inferred from a tree, but also features that are not treelike. The method is highly scalable, allowing for investigation of genome evolution across a large number of genomes. Instead of using specific regions or sequences from genome sequences, or indeed Haeckel\u2019s idea of ontogeny, we argue that genome phylogenies can be inferred using k-mers from whole-genome sequences. Representing these networks dynamically allows biological questions of interest to be formulated and addressed quickly and in a visually intuitive manner.', u'/articles/5-2789/v1', ['Development & Evolution', 'Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Plant Biology, Ecology & Environmental Sciences'], [u'Institute for Molecular Bioscience, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia']]

Functions of CHK2 include the prevention of damaged cells from going through the cell cycle or proliferating and the maintenance of chromosomal stability. CHEK2 mutations have been reported in a variety of cancers including glioblastoma, ovarian, prostate, colorectal, gastric, thyroid, and lung cancer in studies performed mainly in White populations. The most studied mutation in CHEK2 is c.1100delC, which was associated with increased risk of breast cancer. The objective of this study was to compile mutations in CHEK2 identified in cancer genomics studies in different populations and especially in Latin American individuals.\nMethods: A revision of cancer genomics data repositories and a profound literature review of Latin American studies was performed.\nResults: Mutations with predicted high impact in CHEK2 were reported in studies from Australia, Japan, United States, among other countries. The TCGA cancer types with most\xa0mutations in CHEK2 were breast, colorectal, and non-small cell lung cancer. The most common mutation found was E321* in three patients with uterine cancer. In Latin American individuals nine mutations were found in melanoma, lymphoma, and head and neck cohorts from TCGA and ICGC. Latin American studies have been restricted to breast and colorectal cancer and only two mutations out of four that have been interrogated in this population were identified, namely c.1100delC and c.349A>G.\nConclusions: This study presents a compilation of mutations in CHEK2 with high impact in different cancer types in White, Hispanic and other populations.

[u'Approaches to R education in Canadian universities', ['Michael A. Carson', 'Nathan Basiliko'], u'30 Nov 2016', u'Introduction: R language is a powerful tool used in a wide array of research disciplines and owes a large amount of its success to its open source and adaptable nature. The popularity of R has grown rapidly over the past two decades and the number of users and packages is increasing at a near exponential rate. This rapid growth has prompted a number of formal and informal online and text resources, the volume of which is beginning to present challenges to novices learning R. Students are often first exposed to R in upper division undergraduate classes or during their graduate studies. The way R is presented likely has consequences for the fundamental understanding of the program and language itself; user comprehension of R may be better if learning the language itself followed by conducting analyses, compared to someone who is learning another subject (e.g. statistics) using R for the first time. Consequently, an understanding of the approaches to R education is critical. Methods: To establish how students are exposed to R, we used a survey to evaluate the current use in Canadian university courses, including the context in which R is presented and the types of uses of R in the classroom. Additionally, we looked at the reasons professors either do or don\u2019t use/teach R. Results: We found that R is used in a broad range of course disciplines beyond statistics (e.g. ecology) and just over one half of Canadian universities have at least one course that uses R. Discussion and Conclusions: Developing programming-literate students is of utmost importance and our hope is that this benchmark study will influence how post-secondary educators, as well as other programmers, approach R, specifically when developing educational and supplemental content in online, text, and package-specific formats aiding in student\u2019s comprehension of the R language.', u'/articles/5-2802/v1', ['Publishing, Education & Communication'], [u'Department of Biology and the Vale Living with Lakes Centre, Laurentian University, Sudbury, Canada']]

The Cox regression is currently a commonly accepted approach for such tasks in clinical applications. More complex methods, like ensemble approaches, have the potential of reaching better prediction accuracy at the cost of increased training difficulty and worse result interpretability. Better performance on a specific data set may also be obtained by extensive manual exploration in the data space, but such developed models are subject to overfitting and usually not directly applicable to a different data set. We propose DWCox, a density-weighted Cox model that has improved robustness against outliers and thus can provide more accurate predictions of prostate cancer survival. DWCox assigns weights to the training data according to their local kernel density in the feature space, and incorporates those weights into the partial likelihood function. A linear regression is then used to predict the actual survival times from the predicted risks. In the 2015 Prostate Cancer DREAM Challenge, DWCox obtained the best average ranking in prediction accuracy on the risk and survival time. The success of DWCox is remarkable given that it is one of the smallest and most interpretable models submitted to the challenge. In simulations, DWCox performed consistently better than a standard Cox model when the training data contained many sparsely distributed outliers. Although developed for prostate cancer patients, DWCox can be easily re-trained and applied to other survival analysis problems.

[u'A data-driven approach to estimating the number of clusters in hierarchical clustering', ['Antoine E.

In cases where the number of clusters is not known, one can resort to hierarchical clustering methods. However, there currently exist very few automated algorithms for determining the true number of clusters in the data. We propose two new methods (mode and maximum difference) for estimating the number of clusters in a hierarchical clustering framework to create a fully automated process with no human intervention. These methods are compared to the established elbow and gap statistic algorithms using simulated datasets and the Biobase Gene ExpressionSet. We also explore a data mixing procedure inspired by cross validation techniques. We find that the overall performance of the maximum difference method is comparable or greater to that of the gap statistic in multi-cluster scenarios, and achieves that performance at a fraction of the computational cost. This method also responds well to our mixing procedure, which opens the door to future research. We conclude that both the mode and maximum difference methods warrant further study related to their mixing and cross-validation potential. We particularly recommend the use of the maximum difference method in multi-cluster scenarios given its accuracy and execution times, and present it as an alternative to existing algorithms.', u'/articles/5-2809/v1', ['Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'Quantech Solutions LLC, San Rafael, CA, USA']]

Investigation of their population structure is an important problem, the solution of which determines measures for conservation of these species. According to previous studies, \u2018baerii-like\u2019 mitotypes were found in the Caspian Sea among 35% of Russian sturgeon specimens, but were not found in Persian sturgeons. This confirms genetic isolation of the Persian sturgeon from the Russian sturgeon in the Caspian Sea. However, in order to clarify the relationships of these species it is necessary to analyze nuclear DNA markers. The amplified fragment length polymorphism (method) allows estimating interpopulation and interspecific genetic distances using nuclear DNA markers. In the present study, four samples were compared: Persian sturgeons from the South Caspian Sea, Russian sturgeons from the Caspian Sea and the Sea of Azov, and Siberian sturgeons from the Ob\u2019 River, which are close to these two species, but are also clearly morphologically and genetically distinct from them. For the AFLP method, eight pairs of selective primers were used.

Norman', 'Muneer Abbas'], u'02 Dec 2016', u'Introduction: LCK gene, also known as lymphocyte-specific proto-oncogene, is expressed in lymphocytes, and associated with coordinated expression of MHC class I and II in response to physiological stimuli, mediated through a combined interaction of promoters, suppressors, and enhancers. Differential usage of LCK promoters, transcribes dysfunctional transcript variants leading to leukemogenesis and non-induction of MHC class I gene variants. Viruses use C-type lectins, like CD209, to penetrate the cell, and inhibit Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRR), hence evading immune destruction. Given that Ebolavirus (EBOV) disease burden could result from a dysfunctional LCK pathway, identification of the genetic pathway leading to proper immune induction is a major priority. Methods: Data for EBOV related virus samples were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus database and RMEAN information per gene per sample were entered into a table of values. R software v.3.3.1 was used to process differential expression patterns across samples for LCK, CD209 and immune-related genes. Principal component analysis (PCA) using ggbiplot v.0.55 was used to explain the variance across samples. Results: Data analyses identified three viral clusters based on transmission patterns as follows: LCK-CD209 dependent, LCK-dependent specific to EBOV, and CD209 dependent. Compared to HLA class II gene variants, HLA class I (A, B and C) variants were <2 fold expressed, especially for EBOV samples. PCA analyses classified TYRO3, TBK1 and LCK genes independent of the data, leading to identification of a possible pathway involving LCK, IL2, PI3k, TBK1, TYRO3 and MYB genes with downstream induction of immune T-cells. Discussion: This is the first study undertaken to understand the non-functional immune pathway, leading to EBOV disease pathogenesis and high fatality rates.

[u'Validation of commercially available sphingosine kinase 2 antibodies for use in immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence', ['Heidi A. Neubauer', 'Stuart M. Pitson'], u'06 Dec 2016', u'Sphingosine kinase 2 (SK2) is a ubiquitously expressed lipid kinase that has important, albeit complex and poorly understood, roles in regulating cell survival and cell death. In addition to being able to promote cell cycle arrest and apoptosis under certain conditions, it has recently been shown that SK2 can promote neoplastic transformation and tumorigenesis in vivo. Therefore, well validated and reliable tools are required to study and better understand the true functions of SK2. Here, we compare two commercially available SK2 antibodies: a rabbit polyclonal antibody from Proteintech that recognizes amino acids 266-618 of human SK2a, and a rabbit polyclonal antibody from ECM Biosciences that recognizes amino acids 36-52 of human SK2a. We examine the performance of these antibodies for use in immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence staining of endogenous SK2, using human HEK293 and HeLa cell lines, as well as mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Furthermore, we assess the specificity of these antibodies to the target protein through the use of siRNA-mediated SK2 knockdown and SK2 knockout (Sphk2-/-) MEFs. Our results demonstrate that the Proteintech anti-SK2 antibody reproducibly displayed superior sensitivity and selectivity towards SK2 in immunoblot analyses, while the ECM Biosciences anti-SK2 antibody was reproducibly superior for SK2 immunoprecipitation and detection by immunofluorescence staining. Notably, both antibodies produced non-specific bands and staining in the MEFs, which was not observed with the human cell lines.

Patients were randomized in two groups. In group \u201cA\u201d, patients received diclofenac suppository one hour prior to the procedure while group \u201cB\u201d did not receive diclofenac suppository. Both groups received 10 ml of intra-urethral \xa0plain gel for lubrication during flexible cystoscopy. Pain score was recorded immediately after the procedure using the visual analogue scale (VAS).

Regression analysis was performed to address the confounding variables.\nRESULTS: Both groups were comparable for variables including age, duration of procedure, level of operating surgeon and indication of procedure. Most common indication for flexible cystoscopy was removal of double J stent. There was a statistically significant difference in the mean pain score between two groups (p\xa0= 0.012).\xa0 The difference in post-procedure mean pulse rate in the two groups was statistically significant (p= 0.01) however there was no difference observed in mean post procedure systolic blood pressure.

Each data provider is responsible for ensuring a Data Access Committee is in place to grant access to data stored in the EGA. Moreover, the transfer of data during upload and download is encrypted. ELIXIR, a European research infrastructure for life-science data, initiated a project (2016 Human Data Implementation Study) to understand and document the ELIXIR requirements for secure management of controlled-access data.

Meta-analyses were performed in OMiCC using comparisons constructed by the participants to identify 1) gene expression signatures for each disease (disease versus healthy controls at the gene expression and biological pathway levels), 2) conserved signatures across all diseases within each species (pan-disease signatures), and 3) conserved signatures between species for each disease and across all diseases (cross-species signatures).\n\nResults: A large number of differentially expressed genes were identified for each disease based on meta-analysis, with observed overlap among diseases both within and across species. Gene set/pathway enrichment of upregulated genes suggested conserved signatures (e.g., interferon) across all human and mouse conditions.\n\nConclusions: Our Jamboree exercise provides evidence that when enabled by appropriate tools, a "crowd" of biologists can work together to accelerate the pace by which the increasingly large amounts of public data can be reused and meta-analyzed for generating and testing hypotheses.

Recently, the POSEIDON group (Patient-Oriented Strategies Encompassing IndividualizeD Oocyte Number) proposed a new stratification of assisted reproductive technology (ART) in patients with a reduced ovarian reserve or unexpected inappropriate ovarian response to exogenous gonadotropins.

The POSEIDON group also introduced a new measure for successful ART treatment, namely, the ability to retrieve the number of oocytes needed for the specific patient to obtain at least one euploid embryo for transfer. This feature represents a pragmatic endpoint to clinicians and enables the development of prediction models aiming to reduce the time-to-pregnancy (TTP). Consequently, the POSEIDON stratification should not be applied for retrospective analyses having live birth rate (LBR) as endpoint. Such an approach would fail as the attribution of patients to each Poseidon group is related to specific requirements and could only be made prospectively.

[u'Effects of sub-lethal teratogen exposure during larval development on egg laying and egg quality in adult Caenorhabditis elegans', ['Alexis Killeen', 'Caralina Marin de Evsikova'], u'28 Dec 2016', u'Background:\xa0Acute high dose exposure to teratogenic chemicals alters the proper development of an embryo leading to infertility, impaired fecundity, and few viable offspring. However, chronic exposure to sub-toxic doses of teratogens during early development may also have long-term impacts on egg quality and embryo viability. Methods:\xa0To test the hypothesis that low dose exposure during early development can impact long-term reproductive health, Caenorhabditis elegans larvae were exposed to 10 teratogens during larval development, and subsequently were examined for the pattern of egg-laying and egg quality (hatched larvae and embryo viability) as gravid adults.\xa0After the exposure, adult gravid worms were transferred to untreated plates and the numbers of eggs laid were recorded every 3 hours, and the day following exposure the numbers of hatched larvae were counted. Results:\xa0While fecundity and fertility were typically impaired by teratogens, unexpectedly, many teratogens initially increased egg-laying at the earliest interval compared to control but not at later intervals. However, egg quality, as assessed by embryo viability, remained the same because many of the eggs (<50%) did not hatch.

[u'Systematic assessment of multi-gene predictors of pan-cancer cell line sensitivity to drugs exploiting gene expression data', ['Linh Nguyen', 'Cuong C Dang', 'Pedro Ballester'], u'28 Dec 2016', u'Background: Selected gene mutations are routinely used to guide the selection of cancer drugs for a given patient tumour. Large pharmacogenomic data sets were introduced to discover more of these single-gene markers of drug sensitivity. Very recently, machine learning regression has been used to investigate how well cancer cell line sensitivity to drugs is predicted depending on the type of molecular profile. The latter has revealed that gene expression data is the most predictive profile in the pan-cancer setting. However, no study to date has exploited GDSC data to systematically compare the performance of machine learning models based on multi-gene expression data against that of widely-used single-gene markers based on genomics data. Methods: Here we present this systematic comparison using Random Forest (RF) classifiers exploiting the expression levels of 13,321 genes and an average of 501 tested cell lines per drug. To account for time-dependent batch effects in IC50 measurements, we employ independent test sets generated with more recent GDSC data than that used to train the predictors and show that this is a more realistic validation than K-fold cross-validation. Results and Discussion: Across 127 GDSC drugs, our results show that the single-gene markers unveiled by the MANOVA analysis tend to achieve higher precision than these RF-based multi-gene models, at the cost of generally having a poor recall (i.e. correctly detecting only a small part of the cell lines sensitive to the drug). Regarding overall classification performance, about two thirds of the drugs are better predicted by multi-gene RF classifiers. Among the drugs with the most predictive of these models, we found pyrimethamine, sunitinib and 17-AAG. Conclusions: We now know that this type of models can predict in vitro tumour response to these drugs. These models can thus be further investigated on in vivo tumour models.', u'/articles/5-2927/v1', ['Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'Cancer Research Center of Marseille, INSERM U1068, Marseille, France', u'Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France', u'Aix-Marseille Universit\xe9, Marseille, France', u'Cancer Research Center of Marseille UMR7258, Marseille, France']]

Low and middle-income countries in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world are most affected by lightning. Bangladesh is one of the countries at particular risk, with a high number of devastating lightning injuries in the past years, causing high mortality and morbidity. The exact magnitude of the problem is still unknown and therefore this study investigates the epidemiology of lightning injuries in Bangladesh, using a national representative sample.\nMethods: A mixed method was used. The study is based on results from a nationwide cross-sectional survey performed in 2003 in twelve randomly selected districts. In the survey, a total of 819,429 respondents from 171,336 households were interviewed using face-to-face interviews. In addition, qualitative information was obtained by reviewing national and international newspaper reports of lightning injuries sustained in Bangladesh between 13 and 15 May 2016.\nResults: The annual mortality rate was 3.661 (95% CI 0.9313\u20139.964) per 1,000,000 people. The overall incidence of lightning injury was 19.89/100,000 people. Among the victims, 60.12% (n=98) were males and 39.87% (n=65) were females. Males were particularly vulnerable, with a 1.46 times increased risk compared with females (RR 1.46, 95% CI 1.06\u20131.99). Rural populations were more vulnerable, with a 8.73 times higher risk, than urban populations (RR 8.73, 95% CI 5.13\u201314.86). About 43% of injuries occurred between 12 noon and 6 pm. The newspapers reported 81 deaths during 2 days of electric storms in 2016. Lightning has been declared a natural disaster in Bangladesh.\nConclusions: The current study indicates that lightning injuries are a public health problem in Bangladesh. The study recommends further investigations to develop interventions to reduce lightning injuries, mortality and related burden in Bangladesh.', u'/articles/5-2931/v1', ['Public Health & Epidemiology'], [u'Centre for Injury Prevention and Research, Bangladesh (CIPRB), Dhaka, Bangladesh', u'School of Health Sciences, \xd6rebro University, \xd6rebro, Sweden']]

The CD161-Lectin-like Transcript 1 (LLT1) pair has gained particular attention in recent years, yet a detailed analysis of LLT1 distribution in human tissue is lacking. One reason for this is the limited availability and poor characterisation of anti-LLT1 antibodies. Methods: We assessed the staining capabilities of a novel anti-LLT1 antibody clone (2H7), both by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry, showing its efficiency at LLT1 recognition in both settings. We then analysed LLT1 expression in a wide variety of human tissues. Results: We found LLT1 expression in circulating B cells and monocytes, but not in lung and liver-resident macrophages. We found strikingly high LLT1 expression in immune-privileged sites, such as the brain, placenta and testes, and confirmed the ability of LLT1 to inhibit NK cell function.

In some cases, cropland extensification had as much of a negative impact on global and regional yields as climate change.\xa0Conclusions: To maintain the momentum in yield growth across the globe 1) the transfer of agricultural chemicals and investment in agricultural science and management in the tropics must increase rapidly and 2) international trade in agricultural products must expand significantly.', u'/articles/5-2930/v1', ['Plant Biology, Ecology & Environmental Sciences'], [u'Department of Economics, Bowdoin College, Brunswick, USA', u'Department of Computer Science, Bowdoin College, Brunswick, USA']]

Chronic psychosocial stressors may cause serotonin release resulting in immune system dysregulation, as evidenced by increased or far decreased levels of cortisol, a blood biomarker of stress and immune function. We hypothesize that genetic polymorphisms in the HTR7 gene are associated with both hypo- and hyper-cortisolism. Methods: The study population included 602 African American subjects between 18-34 years of age, living in Washington, D.C. Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in HTR7, rs2420367, rs12412496, rs2185706, rs7089533, and rs7093602 were genotyped by restriction fragment length polymorphism or the TaqMan assay. Statistical analysis, using the program SNPstat, was performed to determine their associations with cortisol measured in the study population. Results: While an increased risk of hypocortisolism was found to be associated with rs2420367, rs2185706, and rs7093602 in a gender specific manner, no genotypes could be associated with hypercortisolism. Inversely, a decreased risk of hypocortisolism was found with the haplotype CGGCC (p=0.033), which remained significant in males. When adjusting for gender, females associated with the haplotype AGACC. Hypercortisolism was also associated with a decreased risk for the haplotypes AAACC (p=0.042) and AAGTT (p=0.001).

Each recording was uninterpretable with digital filtering because of muscle artifact and processed using AR1 and AR2 and reviewed by 26 EEG specialists. EEG readers assessed seizure-onset time, lateralization, and region, and specified confidence for each determination. The two methods were validated on the basis of the number of readers able to render assignments, confidence, the intra-class correlation (ICC), and agreement with other clinical findings.\nResults: Among the 23 seizures, two-thirds of the readers were able to delineate seizure-onset time in 10 of 23 using AR1, and 15 of 23 using AR2 (p<0.01). Fewer readers could lateralize seizure-onset (p<0.05). The confidence measures of the assignments were low (probable-unlikely), but increased using AR2 (p<0.05). The ICC for identifying the time of seizure-onset was 0.15 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.11-0.18) using AR1 and 0.26 (95% CI 0.21-0.30) using AR2.\xa0 The EEG interpretations were often consistent with behavioral, neurophysiological, and neuro-radiological findings, with left sided assignments correct in 95.9% (CI 85.7-98.9%, n=4) of cases using AR2.\nConclusions: EEG artifact reduction methods for localizing seizure-onset does not result in high rates of interpretability, reader confidence, and inter-reader agreement.

For many of these pathogens, there are limited options for therapy and resistance to commonly used drugs is fast emerging. The availability of genome sequences of many eukaryotic protozoa is providing important data for understanding parasite biology and identifying new drug and vaccine targets. The folate synthesis and salvage pathway are important for eukaryote pathogen survival and organismal biology and may present new targets for drug discovery.\nMethods: We applied a combination of bioinformatics methods to examine the genomes of pathogens in the EupathDB for genes encoding homologues of proteins that mediate folate salvage in a bid to identify and assign putative functions. We also performed phylogenetic comparisons of identified proteins. .\nResults: We identified 234 proteins to be involve in folate transport in 63 strains, 28 pathogen species and 12 phyla, 60% of which were identified for the first time. Many of the genomes examined contained genes encoding transporters such as folate-binding protein YgfZ, folate/pteridine transporter, folate/biopterin transporter, reduced folate carrier family protein, folate/methotrexate transporter FT1.

Elevated expression and/or altered distribution of the kinase have been implicated in the neurological impairments associated with Down syndrome (DS) and Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). Consequently, DYRK1A inhibition has been of significant interest as a potential strategy for therapeutic intervention of DS and AD. Many classes of novel inhibitors have been described in the past decade. Although non-radioactive methods for analyzing DYRK1A inhibition have been developed, methods employing radioactive tracers are still commonly used for quantitative characterization of DYRK1A inhibitors. Here, we present a non-radioactive ELISA assay based on the detection of DYRK1A-phosphorylated dynamin 1a fragment using a phosphorylation site-specific antibody. The assay was verified by the use of two well-characterized DYRK1A inhibitors, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and harmine. The IC50s for EGCG and harmine determined by the ELISA method were found to be comparable to those previously measured by radioactive tracing methods.\xa0 Furthermore, we determined the mode of inhibition for EGCG and harmine by a modification of the ELISA assay.

[u'Molecular signature of anastasis for reversal of apoptosis', ['Ho Man Tang', 'C. Conover Talbot Jr', 'Ming Chiu Fung', 'Ho Lam Tang'], u'13 Jan 2017', u'Apoptosis is a type of programmed cell death that is essential for normal organismal development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms by eliminating unwanted, injured, or dangerous cells. This cell suicide process is generally assumed to be irreversible. However, accumulating studies suggest that dying cells can recover from the brink of cell death. We recently discovered an unexpected reversibility of the execution-stage of apoptosis in vitro and in vivo, and proposed the term anastasis (Greek for \u201crising to life\u201d) to describe this cell recovery phenomenon. Promoting anastasis could in principle preserve injured cells that are difficult to replace, such as cardiomyocytes and neurons. Conversely, arresting anastasis in dying cancer cells after cancer therapies could improve treatment efficacy. To develop new therapies that promote or inhibit anastasis, it is essential to identify the key regulators and mediators of anastasis \u2013 the therapeutic targets. Therefore, we performed time-course microarray analysis to explore the molecular mechanisms of anastasis during reversal of ethanol-induced apoptosis in mouse primary liver cells. We found striking changes in transcription of genes involved in multiple pathways, including early activation of pro-survival genes, cell cycle arrest, stress-inducible responses, and at delayed times, cell migration and angiogenesis.

Current large-scale projects, such as the ICGC PanCancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG), the Data Platform for the U.S. Precision Medicine Initiative, and the NIH Big Data to Knowledge Center for Translational Genomics, are using cloud-based infrastructure to both host and perform analysis across large data sets. In PCAWG, over 5,800 whole human genomes were aligned and variant called across 14 cloud and HPC environments; the processed data was then made available on the cloud for further analysis and sharing. If run locally, an operation at this scale would have monopolized a typical academic data centre for many months, and would have presented major challenges for data storage and distribution. However, this scale is increasingly typical for genomics projects and necessitates a rethink of how analytical tools are packaged and moved to the data. For PCAWG, we embraced the use of highly portable Docker images for encapsulating and sharing complex alignment and variant calling workflows across highly variable environments. While successful, this endeavor revealed a limitation in Docker containers, namely the lack of a standardized way to describe and execute the tools encapsulated inside the container. As a result, we created the Dockstore (https://dockstore.org), a project that brings together Docker images with standardized, machine-readable ways of describing and running the tools contained within.

Additionally, it removes the need for third parties, and gives participative control to the peer-to-peer users.

In this paradigm, the volunteers had to choose the pseudoisochromatic stimulus containing a test frequency at four directions (e.g., up, down, right and left) in the subtest of Cambridge Colour Test (CCT): Trivector. Results: Performance on CCT differed between groups, and the observed pattern was that smokers had lower discrimination compared to non-smokers. In addition, deprived smokers presented lower discrimination to smokers and non-smokers. Contrary to expectation, the largest differences were observed for medium and long wavelengths. Conclusions: These results suggests that cigarette smoke and chronic exposure to nicotine, or withdrawal from nicotine, affects CD. This highlights the importance of understanding the diffuse effects of nicotine either attentional bias on color vision.', u'/articles/6-85/v1', ['Eye Disorders & ENT'], [u'Department of Psychology, Federal University of Para\xedba, Joao Pessoa, Brazil', u'Perception, Neuroscience and Behavior Laboratory, Federal University of Para\xedba, Joao Pessoa, Brazil']]
[u'Seven perspectives on GPCR H/D-exchange proteomics methods', ['Xi Zhang'], u'30 Jan 2017', u'Recent research shows surging interest to visualize human G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) dynamic structures using the bottom-up H/D-exchange (HDX) proteomics technology. This opinion article clarifies critical technical nuances and logical thinking behind the GPCR HDX proteomics method, to help scientists overcome cross-discipline pitfalls, and understand and reproduce the protocol at high quality. The 2010 89% HDX structural coverage of GPCR was achieved with both structural and analytical rigor. This article emphasizes systematically considering membrane protein structure stability and compatibility with chromatography and mass spectrometry (MS) throughout the pipeline, including the effects of metal ions, zero-detergent shock, and freeze-thaws on HDX result rigor. This article proposes to view bottom-up HDX as two steps to guide choices of detergent buffers and chromatography settings: (I) protein HDX labeling in native buffers, and (II) peptide-centric analysis of HDX labels, which applies (a) bottom-up MS/MS to construct peptide matrix and (b) HDX MS to locate and quantify H/D labels. The detergent-low-TCEP digestion method demystified the challenge of HDX-grade GPCR digestion. GPCR HDX proteomics is a structural approach, thus its choice of experimental conditions should let structure lead and digestion follow, not the opposite.', u'/articles/6-89/v1', ['Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'Independent Researcher, Montreal, QC, H2Y 1H3, Canada']]
[u'Computational design of molecular motors as nanocircuits in Leishmaniasis', ['Dipali Kosey', 'Shailza Singh'], u'31 Jan 2017', u'Cutaneous leishmaniasis is the most common form of lesihmaniasis, caused by Leishmania major and is spread by the bite of a sandfly.This species infects the macrophages and dendritic cells Due to multi-drug resistance, there is a need for a new therapeutic technique. Recently, a novel molecular motor of Leishmania, Myosin XXI, was classified and characterized. In addition, the drug resistance in this organism has been linked with the overexpression of ABC transporters. Systems biology aims to study the simulation and modeling of natural biological systems whereas synthetic biology deals with building novel and artificial biological parts and devices \xa0Together they have contributed enormously to drug discovery, vaccine design and development, infectious disease detection and diagnostics. Synthetic genetic regulatory networks with desired properties, like toggling and oscillation have been proposed to be useful for gene therapy. In this work, a nanocircuit with coupled bistable switch \u2013 repressilator \xa0has been designed, simulated in the presence and absence of inducer, in silico, using Tinker Cell. When inducer is added, the circuit has been shown to produce reporter at high levels, which will impair the activity of Myosin XXI and ABC transporters. Validation of the circuit was also performed using GRENITS and BoolNet. The influence of inducer on the working of the circuit, i.e., the type of gene expression, response time delay, the steady states formed by the circuit and the quasipotential landscape of the circuit were performed. It was found that the addition of inducer reduced the response time delay in the graded type of gene expression and removed the multiple intermediate attractors of the circuit. Thus, the inducer increased the probability of the circuit to be present in the dominant stable state with high reporter concentration and hence the designed nanocircuit may be used for the treatment of leishmaniasis.', u'/articles/6-94/v1', ['Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'National Centre for Cell Science, NCCS Complex, SP Pune University Campus, Pune, India']]
[u'Prenatal brain MRI samples for development of automatic segmentation, target- recognition and machine-learning algorithms to detect anatomical structures', ['Hugues Gentillon', 'Ludomir Stefanczyk', 'Micha Strzelecki', 'Maria Respondek-Liberska'], u'31 Jan 2017', u'In this data note, we present a sorted pool of fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) specimens, selected for a project seeking to further develop a computer-vision software called MaZda, originally created for magnetic resonance (MR) image analysis. A link to download the samples is provided in the manuscript herein. This data descriptor further explains how and why these fetal MRI samples were selected. Firstly, thousands of cross-sectional images obtained from fetal MRI scans were processed and sorted semi-manually with other software. We did so because a built-in \u201csamplesort\u201d (sorting algorithm) is missing in MaZda version 5. Additionally, the software is unfortunately lacking effective and efficient algorithms to allow automatic identification and segmentation of anatomical structures in fetal MRI samples. Hence, the finals sorting steps were carried out manually via time-consuming methods \u2014 i.e. human- visual detection and classifications by the gestational age of pregnancy and the rotational plane of the MR scanner. Thus the latter correlates with the anatomical plane of the mother, rather than the hypothetical plane used to transect the fetus. In brief, we collated these fetal MRI samples in an effort to facilitate future research and discovery, especially to aid the improvement of MaZda.', u'/articles/6-93/v1', ['Urology, Gynecology & Obstetrics'], [u'Department of Radiology and Diagnostic Imaging, Barlicki University Hospital, Medical University of \u0141\xf3d\u017a, \u0141\xf3d\u017a, Poland', u'Institute of Electronics, The Faculty of Electrical, Electronic, Computer and Control Engineering, Technical University of \u0141\xf3d\u017a, \u0141\xf3d\u017a, Poland', u'Diagnosis and Prevention of Congenital Malformations, Instytut Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki, \u0141\xf3d\u017a, Poland']]

Methods: Based on the transcriptome sequencing data from human embryonic stem cells, we analyzed multiple data features of PacBio and ONT, including error pattern, length, mappability and technical improvements over previous platforms. We also evaluated their application to transcriptome analyses, such as isoform identification and quantification and characterization of transcriptome complexity, by comparing the performance of PacBio, ONT and their corresponding Hybrid-Seq strategies (PacBio+Illumina and ONT+Illumina). Results: PacBio shows overall better data quality, while ONT provides a higher yield. As with data quality, PacBio performs marginally better than ONT in most aspects for both long reads only and Hybrid-Seq strategies in transcriptome analysis. In addition, Hybrid-Seq shows superior performance over long reads only in most transcriptome analyses. Conclusions: Both PacBio and ONT sequencing are suitable for full-length single-molecule transcriptome analysis. As this first use of ONT reads in a Hybrid-Seq analysis has shown, both PacBio and ONT can benefit from a combined Illumina strategy. The tools and analytical methods developed here provide a resource for future applications and evaluations of these rapidly-changing technologies.', u'/articles/6-100/v1', ['Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA', u'Oxford Genomics Centre, Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK', u'Key laboratory of Genetics Network Biology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Genetics and Development, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China', u'University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China', u'Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA', u'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA', u'Department of Biostatistics, University of Iowa, Iowa City, USA']]
