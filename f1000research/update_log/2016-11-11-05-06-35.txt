[u'Should hydrogen therapy be included in a musculoskeletal medicine routine?', ['Sergej M. Ostojic'], u'10 Nov 2016', u'Molecular hydrogen (H2) has recently been recognized as a potential novel therapeutic agent in biomedicine. Initially proposed to be a possible treatment for certain types of neuromuscular disorders, cardio-metabolic diseases and cancer, H2 improved clinical end-points and surrogate markers in several clinical trials, mainly acting as an anti-inflammatory agent and powerful antioxidant. In this paper, the medicinal properties of H2 in musculoskeletal medicine are discussed with the aim to provide an updated and practical overview for health professionals working in this field.', u'/articles/5-2659/v1', ['Bone Disorders', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'Faculty of Sport and PE, University of Novi Sad, Novi Sad, Serbia', u'University of Belgrade School of Medicine, Belgrade, Serbia']]
[u'Intensive nutritional counselling obviates a weight gain in kidney transplant recipients with long-term graft survival in Estonia', ['Liidia Kiisk', 'Mai Ots-Rosenberg'], u'10 Nov 2016', u'Background. After kidney transplantation body weight gain (WG) in patients generally increases and this can be influenced by improved appetite and reversal of the uremic state. Because of a lack of evidence for effective interventions that prevent body WG after kidney transplantation, Ryan et al. recently published a randomized controlled trial design in BMC Nephrology to assess the effects of intensive nutrition interventions on WG and metabolic parameters. Here we are demonstrating a part of a study performed at our transplantation centre where we also performed an intensive nutritional counselling intervention on kidney recipients. We hypothesised that kidney transplant (KTx) patients who received intensive counselling may have better long-term weight control compared with patients who did not receive such counselling.\nMethods. During intensive counselling the dietician took into consideration the results of anthropometry, densitometry, biochemistry, food frequency questionnaire and an analysis of 3-day dietary records. Anthropometrical measurements were assessed at 18 months, 36 months, and, finally, 10 years after the kidney transplantation.\nResults. We noticed WG in all KTx patients (n=56) both in males and females, as follows: in the standard care group the mean WG in males (N=21) was 6.4 kg, females (N=15) 7.0 kg and among intensively counselled males (N=9) 4.6 kg, females (N=11) 1.1 kg.\xa0 Statistically non-significant weight change was found among counselled living KTx patients with long-term graft survival both in males (p=0.0680) and females ( p=0.3166) which was registered 10 years after the KTx compared with the first measurement mean weight. Among standard care control KTx patients, weight change was statistically significant in both males and females (males: p=0.0016; females:\xa0 p=0.0040) 10 years after the KTx.\nConclusions. The long-term WG data clearly showed that in our population of KT patients, the patients who received intensive individual dietary counselling had much more educated behaviour in the long-term, thereby preventing WG which is a well-known risk factor for long-term graft failure as well as for cardiovascular complications and mortality.', u'/articles/5-2658/v1', ['Hepatology & Nephrology'], [u'Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Tartu University, Tartu, 51014, Estonia']]
[u'Surgical proficiency decreases the rate of healing abnormalities using anterior transobturator mesh in cystocele women', ['Jin-Sung Yuk', 'Yong Jin Kim', 'Kyong Wook Yi', 'Jun-Young Hur', 'Jung-Ho Shin'], u'10 Nov 2016', u'Aims: The objective of this study is to report the outcomes of cystocele repair with anterior transobutrator mesh kits.\xa0\nMethods: 119 consecutive women with cystoceles were treated between January 2006 and November 2010 by a single surgeon at a university hospital using the anterior transobturator mesh kit procedure. Postoperative follow-up visits were scheduled at 1, 6, and 12 months after surgery.\nResults: A total of 114 women who were operated on with the anterior transobturator mesh kit completed 12 months of follow-up. The population had a mean age of 65.8 \xb1 7.0, a body mass index of 25.1 \xb1 3.0, and a parity average of 4.0 \xb1 1.7. An overall anatomic cure was reported for 108 patients (94.7%). The Ba point of the POP-Q exam used for grading cystoceles decreased significantly from 2.5 \xb1 1.6 cm to -2.8 \xb1 0.8 cm after 12 months (P < 0.01). One patient (0.9%) presented with bladder perforation, and five patients (4.4%) showed with healing abnormalities. Surgical case volume was negatively correlated with healing abnormalities after adjusting for age, body mass index, operation time, and parity (P = 0.15).\xa0\nConclusion: The surgeon\u2019s experience decreases the incidence of healing abnormalities using anterior transobturator mesh in cystocele women. The anatomical cure rate of anterior transobturator mesh is quite good.', u'/articles/5-2662/v1', ['Urology, Gynecology & Obstetrics'], [u'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, College of Medicine, Gyeongsang National University, Gyeongsang National University Changwon Hospital, Changwon, Korea, South', u'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, South']]
