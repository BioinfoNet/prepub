[u'Anterior single odontoid screw placement for type II odontoid fractures: our modified surgical technique and initial results in a cohort study of 15 patients', ['Binod Bhattarai', 'Sunil Munakomi', 'Karuna Tamrakar', 'Pramod Kumar Chaudhary'], u'13 Jul 2016', u'Objective: Anterior odontoid screw fixation for type II odontoid fracture is the ideal management option. However in the context of unavailability of an O-arm or neuro-navigation and poor images from the available C-arm may be an obstacle to ideal trajectory and placement of the odontoid screw. We herein detail \xa0our surgical technique so as to ensure a correct trajectory and subsequent good fusion in Type II odontoid fractures. This may be advantageous \xa0in clinical set ups lacking state of the art facilities.\xa0\nMethods and Results: In this cohort study we included 15 consecutive patients who underwent anterior odontoid screw placement. We routinely dissect the longus colli to completely visualize the entire width of C3 body. We then perform a median C2-C3 disectomy followed by creating a gutter in the superior end of C3 body. We then guide the Kirchsner (K) wire purchasing adequate anterior cortex of C2. Rest of the procedure follows the similar steps as described for odontoid screw placement.\r\nWe achieved 100% correct trajectory and screw placement in our study. There were no instances of screw break out, pull out or nonunion. There was one patient mortality following myocardial infarction in our study.\nConclusion: Preoperative imaging details, proper patient positioning, meticulous dissection, thorough anatomical knowledge and few added surgical nuances are the cornerstones in ideal odontoid screw placement. This may be pivotal in managing \xa0patients in developing nations having rudimentary neurosurgical set up.', u'/articles/5-1681/v1', ['Bone Disorders'], [u'Department of Neurosurgery, College of Medical Sciences, Chitwan, Nepal']]
[u'Health as a Complex Adaptive System: a new dimension of patient care in internal medicine and general practice', ['Johannes Bircher', 'Eckhart G. Hahn'], u'12 Jul 2016', u'This paper explores the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of a new concept of health. Investigations into the nature of health have led to a new definition that explains health as a complex adaptive system (CAS) and is based on five components (a-e). Humans like all biological creatures must satisfactorily respond to (a) the demands of life. For this purpose they need (b) a biologically given potential (BGP) and (c) a personally acquired potential (PAP). These properties of individuals are embedded within (d) social and (e) environmental determinants of health. Between these five components of health there are 10 complex interactions that justify health to be viewed as a CAS. In each patient, the current state of his health as a CAS evolved from the past, will move forward to a new future, and has to be analyzed and treated as an autonomous whole. A diagnostic procedure is suggested as follows: together with the patient, the five components and 10 complex interactions are assessed. This may help the patient to better understand his situation and to recognize possible next steps that may be useful for him to evolve toward more health by himself. In this process mutual trust in the patient-physician interaction is critical. The described approach offers new possibilities to help patients to improve their health.', u'/articles/5-1672/v1', ['Public Health & Epidemiology'], [u'Department of Hepatology, University of Bern, Meikirch, CH-3045, Switzerland', u'Department of Medicine 1, University Hospital Erlangen, Erlangen, D-91054, Germany']]
[u'Development and interval testing of a naturalistic driving methodology to evaluate driving behavior in clinical research', ['Ganesh M. Babulal', 'Aaron Addison', 'Nupur Ghoshal', 'Sarah H. Stout', 'Elizabeth K. Vernon', 'Mark Sellan', 'Catherine M. Roe'], u'15 Jul 2016', u'Background: The number of older adults in the United States will double by 2056. Additionally, the number of licensed drivers will increase along with extended driving-life expectancy. Motor vehicle crashes are a leading cause of injury and death in older adults. Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) also negatively impacts driving ability and increases crash risk. Conventional methods to evaluate driving ability are limited in predicting decline among older adults. Innovations in GPS hardware and software can monitor driving behavior in the actual environments people drive in. Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) devices are affordable, easy to install and capture large volumes of data in real-time. However, adapting these methodologies for research can be challenging. This study sought to adapt a COTS device and determine an interval that produced accurate data on the actual route driven for use in future studies involving older adults with and without AD.\xa0\nMethods: Three subjects drove a single course in different vehicles at different intervals (30, 60 and 120 seconds), at different times of day, morning (9:00-11:59AM), afternoon (2:00-5:00PM) and night (7:00-10pm). The nine datasets were examined to determine the optimal collection interval.\nResults: Compared to the 120-second and 60-second intervals, the 30-second interval was optimal in capturing the actual route driven along with the lowest number of incorrect paths and affordability weighing considerations for data storage and curation.\nDiscussion: Use of COTS devices offers minimal installation efforts, unobtrusive monitoring and discreet data extraction. \xa0However, these devices require strict protocols and controlled testing for adoption into research paradigms.\xa0 After reliability and validity testing, these devices may provide valuable insight into daily driving behaviors and intraindividual change over time for populations of older adults with and without AD. \xa0Data can be aggregated over time to look at changes or adverse events and ascertain if decline in performance is occurring.', u'/articles/5-1716/v1', ['Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry'], [u'Charles F. and Joanne Knight Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Center, Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, USA', u'University Geographic Information System, Washington University, St. Louis, USA']]
[u'AutoAnnotate: A Cytoscape app for summarizing networks with semantic annotations', ['Mike Kucera', 'Ruth Isserlin', 'Arkady Arkhangorodsky', 'Gary D. Bader'], u'15 Jul 2016', u'Networks often contain regions of tightly connected nodes, or clusters, that highlight their shared relationships. An effective way to create a visual summary of a network is to identify clusters and annotate them with an enclosing shape and a summarizing label. Cytoscape provides the ability to annotate a network with shapes and labels, however these annotations must be created manually one at a time, which can be a laborious process. AutoAnnotate is a Cytoscape 3 App that automates the process of identifying clusters and visually annotating them. It greatly reduces the time and effort required to fully annotate clusters in a network, and provides freedom to experiment with different strategies for identifying and labelling clusters. Many customization options are available that enable the user to refine the generated annotations as required. Annotated clusters may be collapsed into single nodes using the Cytoscape groups feature, which helps simplify a network by making its overall structure more visible. AutoAnnotate is applicable to any type of network, including enrichment maps, protein-protein interactions, pathways, or social networks.', u'/articles/5-1717/v1', ['Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'The Donnelly Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada']]
