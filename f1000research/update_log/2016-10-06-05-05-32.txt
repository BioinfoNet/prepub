[u'Kv4.2 knockout mice display learning and memory deficits in the Lashley maze', ['Gregory D. Smith', 'Nan Gao', 'Joaquin N. Lugo'], u'05 Oct 2016', u'Background: Potassium channels have been shown to be involved in neural plasticity and learning. Kv4.2 is a subunit of the A-type potassium channel. Kv4.2 channels modulate excitability in the dendrites of pyramidal neurons in the cortex and hippocampus. Deletion of Kv4.2 results in spatial learning and conditioned fear deficits; however, previous studies have only examined deletion of Kv4.2 in aversive learning tests.\nMethods: For the current study, we used the Lashley maze as an appetitive learning test. We examined Kv4.2 wildtype (WT) and knockout (KO) mice in the Lashley maze over 4 days during adulthood. The first day consisted of habituating the mice to the maze. The mice then received five trials per day for the next 3 days. The number of errors and the time to the goal box was recorded for each trial. The goal box contained a weigh boat with an appetitive reward (gelatin with sugar). There was an intertrial interval of 15 minutes.\nResults: We found that Kv4.2 KO mice committed more errors across the trials compared to the WT mice p<0.001. There was no difference in the latency to find the goal box over the period.\nDiscussion: Our finding that deletion of Kv4.2 resulted in more errors in the Lashley maze across 15 trials contribute to a growing body of evidence that Kv4.2 channels are significantly involved in learning and memory.', u'/articles/5-2456/v1', ['Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry'], [u'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Baylor University, Waco, TX, 76798, USA', u'Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, Baylor University, Waco, TX, 76798, USA']]
