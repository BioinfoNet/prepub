[u'Case Report: Whole exome sequencing reveals a novel frameshift deletion mutation p.G2254fs in COL7A1 associated with autosomal recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa', ['Shamsudheen Karuthedath Vellarikkal', 'Rijith Jayarajan', 'Ankit Verma', 'Sreelata Nair', 'Rowmika Ravi', 'Vigneshwar Senthivel', 'Sridhar Sivasubbu', 'Vinod Scaria'], u'17 May 2016', u'Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa simplex (DEB) is a phenotypically diverse inherited skin fragility disorder. It is majorly manifested by appearance of epidermal bullae upon friction caused either by physical or environmental trauma. The phenotypic manifestations also include appearance of milia, scarring all over the body and nail dystrophy. DEB can be inherited in a recessive or dominant form and the recessive form of DEB (RDEB) is more severe. In the present study, we identify a novel p.G2254fs mutation in COL7A1 gene causing a sporadic case of RDEB by whole exome sequencing (WES). Apart from adding a novel frameshift Collagen VII mutation to the repertoire of known mutations reported in the disease, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a genetically characterized case of DEB from India.', u'/articles/5-900/v1', ['Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology', 'Dermatology'], [u'Genomics and Molecular Medicine Unit, CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, Delhi, India', u'Department of Fetal Medicine, Lifeline Super Specialty Hospital, Kerala, India', u'GN Ramachandran Knowledge Center for Genome Informatics, CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, Delhi, India', u'Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research, CSIR-IGIB South Campus, Delhi, India']]
