[u'hackseq: Catalyzing collaboration between biological and computational scientists via hackathon', [], u'28 Feb 2017', u'hackseq (http://www.hackseq.com) was a genomics hackathon with the aim of bringing together a diverse set of biological and computational scientists to work on collaborative bioinformatics projects. In October 2016, 66 participants from nine nations came together for three days for hackseq and collaborated on nine projects ranging from data visualization to algorithm development. The response from participants was overwhelmingly positive with 100% (n = 54) of survey respondents saying they would like to participate in future hackathons. We detail key steps for others interested in organizing a successful hackathon and report excerpts from each project.', u'/articles/6-197/v1', ['Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'']]
