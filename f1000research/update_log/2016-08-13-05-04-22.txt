[u'South-East Asian strains of Plasmodium falciparum display higher\xa0ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous polymorphisms compared to African strains', ['Gajinder Pal Singh', 'Amit Sharma'], u'12 Aug 2016', u'Resistance to frontline anti-malarial drugs, including artemisinin, has repeatedly arisen in South-East Asia, but the reasons for this are not understood. Here we test whether evolutionary constraints on Plasmodium falciparum strains from South-East Asia differ from African strains. We find a significantly higher ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous polymorphisms in P. falciparum from South-East Asia compared to Africa, suggesting differences in the selective constraints on P. falciparum genome in these geographical regions. Furthermore, South-East Asian strains showed a higher proportion of non-synonymous polymorphism at conserved positions, suggesting reduced negative selection. There was a lower rate of mixed infection by multiple genotypes in samples from South-East Asia compared to Africa. We propose that a lower mixed infection rate in South-East Asia reduces intra-host competition between the parasite clones, reducing the efficiency of natural selection. This might increase the probability of fixation of fitness-reducing mutations including drug resistant ones.', u'/articles/5-1964/v1', ['Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases'], [u'Molecular Medicine Group, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB), New Delhi, India']]
[u'Visual acuity measured with luminance-modulated and contrast-modulated noise letter stimuli in young adults and adults above 50 years old', ['Pui Juan Woi', '', 'Sarah J. Waugh', 'Mohd Izzuddin Hairol'], u'12 Aug 2016', u'The human visual system is sensitive in detecting objects that have different luminance level from their background, known as first-order or luminance-modulated (LM) stimuli. We are also able to detect objects that have the same mean luminance as their background, only differing in contrast (or other attributes). Such objects are known as second-order or contrast-modulated (CM), stimuli. CM stimuli are thought to be processed in higher visual areas compared to LM stimuli, and may be more susceptible to ageing. We compared visual acuities (VA) of five healthy older adults (54.0\xb11.83 years old) and five healthy younger adults (25.4\xb11.29 years old) with LM and CM letters under monocular and binocular viewing. For monocular viewing, age had no effect on VA [F(1, 8)= 2.50, p> 0.05]. However, there was a significant main effect of age on VA under binocular viewing [F(1, 8)= 5.67, p< 0.05].\xa0 Binocular VA with CM letters in younger adults was approximately two lines better than that in older adults. For LM, binocular summation ratios were similar for older (1.16\xb10.21) and younger (1.15\xb10.06) adults. For CM, younger adults had higher binocular summation ratio (1.39\xb10.08) compared to older adults (1.12\xb10.09). Binocular viewing improved VA with LM letters for both groups similarly. However, in older adults, binocular viewing did not improve VA with CM letters as much as in younger adults. This could reflect a decline of higher visual areas due to ageing process, most likely higher than V1, which may be missed if measured with luminance-based stimuli alone.', u'/articles/5-1961/v1', ['Eye Disorders & ENT'], [u'Optometry and Vision Sciences Programme, Faculty of Health Sciences, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, 50300, Malaysia', u'Vision and Hearing Sciences, Faculty of Science and Technology, Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge Campus, Cambridge, CB1 1PT, UK']]
[u'Genomic variant annotation workflow for clinical applications', ['Thomas Thurnherr', 'Franziska Singer', 'Daniel J. Stekhoven', 'Niko Beerenwinkel'], u'12 Aug 2016', u'Annotation and interpretation of DNA aberrations identified through next-generation sequencing is becoming an increasingly important task. Even more so in the context of data analysis pipelines for medical applications, where genomic aberrations are associated with phenotypic and clinical features. Here we describe a workflow to identify potential gene targets in aberrated genes or pathways and their corresponding drugs. To this end, we provide the R/Bioconductor package rDGIdb, an R wrapper to query the drug-gene interaction database (DGIdb). DGIdb accumulates drug-gene interaction data from 15 different source databases and allows filtering on different levels. The rDGIdb package makes these resources and tools available to R users. Moreover, DGIdb queries can be automated through incorporation of the rDGIdb package into NGS sequencing pipelines.', u'/articles/5-1963/v1', ['Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering, ETH Zurich, Basel, Switzerland', u'SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Basel, Switzerland', u'NEXUS Personalized Health Technologies, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland']]
