[u'Mitral valve repair', ['Alberto Pozzoli', 'Michele De Bonis', 'Ottavio Alfieri'], u'10 Jun 2016', u'Mitral regurgitation (MR) is the most common valvular heart disease in the Western world. The MR can be either organic (mainly degenerative in Western countries) or functional (secondary to left ventricular remodeling in the context of ischemic or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy). Degenerative and functional MR are completely different disease entities that pose specific decision-making problems and require different management. The natural history of severe degenerative MR is clearly unfavorable. However, timely and effective correction of degenerative MR is associated with a normalization of life expectancy. By contrast, the prognostic impact of the correction of functional MR is still debated and controversial. In this review, we discuss the optimal treatment of both degenerative and functional MR, taking into account current surgical and percutaneous options. In addition, since a clear understanding of the etiology and mechanisms of valvular dysfunction is important to guide the timing and choice of treatment, the role of the heart team and of echo imaging in the management of MR is addressed as well.', u'/articles/5-1326/v1', ['Cardiopulmonary & Vascular Disorders'], [u'Department of Heart Surgery, Vita-Salute University of Milan, Milan, Italy']]

[u'Whole-genome sequencing of nine esophageal adenocarcinoma cell lines', ['Gianmarco Contino', 'Matthew D. Eldridge', 'Maria Secrier', 'Lawrence Bower', 'Rachael Fels Elliott', 'Jamie Weaver', 'Andy G. Lynch', 'Paul A.W. Edwards', 'Rebecca C. Fitzgerald'], u'10 Jun 2016', u'Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is highly mutated and molecularly heterogeneous. The number of cell lines available for study is limited and their genome has been only partially characterized. The availability of an accurate annotation of their mutational landscape is crucial for accurate experimental design and correct interpretation of genotype-phenotype findings. We performed high coverage, paired end whole genome sequencing on eight EAC cell lines\u2014ESO26, ESO51, FLO-1, JH-EsoAd1, OACM5.1 C, OACP4 C, OE33, SK-GT-4\u2014all verified against original patient material, and one esophageal high grade dysplasia cell line, CP-D. We have made available the aligned sequence data and report single nucleotide variants (SNVs), small insertions and deletions (indels), and copy number alterations, identified by comparison with the human reference genome and known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We compare these putative mutations to mutations found in primary tissue EAC samples, to inform the use of these cell lines as a model of EAC.', u'/articles/5-1336/v1', ['Eye Disorders & ENT', 'Oncology & Hematology', 'Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'Medical Research Council (MRC) Cancer Unit, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK', u'Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK', u'Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK']]
