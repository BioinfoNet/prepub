[u'Puzzles in modern biology. II. Language, cancer and the recursive processes of evolutionary innovation', ['Steven A. Frank'], u'09 Sep 2016', u'Human language emerged abruptly. Diverse body forms evolved suddenly. Seed-bearing\xa0plants spread rapidly. How do complex evolutionary innovations arise so\xa0quickly? Resolving alternative claims remains difficult. The great events of the past\xa0happened a long time ago. Cancer provides a model to study evolutionary innovation.\xa0A tumor must evolve many novel traits to become an aggressive cancer. I use what\xa0we know or could study about cancer to describe the key processes of innovation. In\xa0general, evolutionary systems form a hierarchy of recursive processes. Those recursive\xa0processes determine the rates at which innovations are generated, spread and\xa0transmitted. I relate the recursive processes to abrupt evolutionary innovation.', u'/articles/5-2289/v1', ['Development & Evolution', 'Plant Biology, Ecology & Environmental Sciences'], [u'Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, 92697\u20132525, USA']]
[u'Puzzles in modern biology. I. Male sterility, failure reveals design', ['Steven A. Frank'], u'09 Sep 2016', u'Many human males produce dysfunctional sperm. Various plants frequently abort\xa0pollen. Hybrid matings often produce sterile males. Widespread male sterility is puzzling.\xa0Natural selection prunes reproductive failure. Puzzling failure implies something\xa0that we do not understand about how organisms are designed. Solving the puzzle\xa0reveals the hidden processes of design.', u'/articles/5-2288/v1', ['Development & Evolution', 'Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Plant Biology, Ecology & Environmental Sciences'], [u'Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, 92697\u20132525, USA']]
