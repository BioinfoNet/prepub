[u'Updating Darwin: Information and entropy drive the evolution of life', ['Irun R. Cohen'], u'01 Dec 2016', u'The evolution of species, according to Darwin, is driven by struggle \u2013 by competition between variant autonomous individuals for survival of the fittest and reproductive advantage; the outcome of this struggle for survival is natural selection. The Neo-Darwinians reframed natural selection in terms of DNA: inherited genotypes directly encode expressed phenotypes; a fit phenotype means a fit genotype \u2013 thus the evolution of species is the evolution of selfish, reproducing individual genotypes.\xa0\r\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Four general characteristics of advanced forms of life are not easily explained by this Neo-Darwinian paradigm: 1) Dependence on cooperation rather than on struggle, manifested by the microbiome, ecosystems and altruism; 2) The pursuit of diversity rather than optimal fitness, manifested by sexual reproduction; 3) Life\u2019s investment in programmed death, rather then in open-ended survival; and 4) The acceleration of complexity, despite its intrinsic fragility.\xa0\xa0\r\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Here I discuss two mechanisms that can resolve these paradoxical features; both mechanisms arise from viewing life as the evolution of information. Information has two inevitable outcomes; it increases by autocatalyis and it is destroyed by entropy. On the one hand, the autocalalysis of information inexorably drives the evolution of complexity, irrespective of its fragility. On the other hand, only those strategic arrangements that accommodate the destructive forces of entropy survive \u2013 cooperation, diversification, and programmed death result from the entropic selection of evolving species. Physical principles of information and entropy thus fashion the evolution of life.', u'/articles/5-2808/v1', ['Development & Evolution', 'Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Plant Biology, Ecology & Environmental Sciences'], [u'The Department of Immunology, The Weizmann Institute of Science, REhovot, Israel']]
[u'DWCox: A density-weighted Cox model for outlier-robust prediction of prostate cancer survival', ['Jinfeng Xiao', 'Sheng Wang', 'Jingbo Shang', 'Henry Lin', 'Doris Xin', 'Xiang Ren', 'Jiawei Han', 'Jian Peng'], u'01 Dec 2016', u'Reliable predictions on the risk and survival time of prostate cancer patients based on their clinical records can help guide their treatment and provide hints about the disease mechanism. The Cox regression is currently a commonly accepted approach for such tasks in clinical applications. More complex methods, like ensemble approaches, have the potential of reaching better prediction accuracy at the cost of increased training difficulty and worse result interpretability. Better performance on a specific data set may also be obtained by extensive manual exploration in the data space, but such developed models are subject to overfitting and usually not directly applicable to a different data set. We propose DWCox, a density-weighted Cox model that has improved robustness against outliers and thus can provide more accurate predictions of prostate cancer survival. DWCox assigns weights to the training data according to their local kernel density in the feature space, and incorporates those weights into the partial likelihood function. A linear regression is then used to predict the actual survival times from the predicted risks. In the 2015 Prostate Cancer DREAM Challenge, DWCox obtained the best average ranking in prediction accuracy on the risk and survival time. The success of DWCox is remarkable given that it is one of the smallest and most interpretable models submitted to the challenge. In simulations, DWCox performed consistently better than a standard Cox model when the training data contained many sparsely distributed outliers. Although developed for prostate cancer patients, DWCox can be easily re-trained and applied to other survival analysis problems. DWCox is implemented in R and can be downloaded from https://github.com/JinfengXiao/DWCox.', u'/articles/5-2806/v1', ['Oncology & Hematology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology', 'Urology, Gynecology & Obstetrics'], [u'Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana-Champaign, USA']]
[u'A data-driven approach to estimating the number of clusters in hierarchical clustering', ['Antoine E. Zambelli'], u'01 Dec 2016', u'DNA microarray and gene expression problems often require a researcher to perform clustering on their data in a bid to better understand its structure. In cases where the number of clusters is not known, one can resort to hierarchical clustering methods. However, there currently exist very few automated algorithms for determining the true number of clusters in the data. We propose two new methods (mode and maximum difference) for estimating the number of clusters in a hierarchical clustering framework to create a fully automated process with no human intervention. These methods are compared to the established elbow and gap statistic algorithms using simulated datasets and the Biobase Gene ExpressionSet. We also explore a data mixing procedure inspired by cross validation techniques. We find that the overall performance of the maximum difference method is comparable or greater to that of the gap statistic in multi-cluster scenarios, and achieves that performance at a fraction of the computational cost. This method also responds well to our mixing procedure, which opens the door to future research. We conclude that both the mode and maximum difference methods warrant further study related to their mixing and cross-validation potential. We particularly recommend the use of the maximum difference method in multi-cluster scenarios given its accuracy and execution times, and present it as an alternative to existing algorithms.', u'/articles/5-2809/v1', ['Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'Quantech Solutions LLC, San Rafael, CA, USA']]
[u'Evolutionary relations and population differentiation of Acipenser gueldenstaedtii Brandt, Acipenser persicus Borodin, and Acipenser baerii Brandt', ['Alexey Sergeev'], u'01 Dec 2016', u'Russian (Acipenser gueldenstaedtii), Persian (A. persicus) and Siberian (A. baerii) sturgeons are closely related \u2018Ponto-Caspian\u2019 species. Investigation of their population structure is an important problem, the solution of which determines measures for conservation of these species. According to previous studies, \u2018baerii-like\u2019 mitotypes were found in the Caspian Sea among 35% of Russian sturgeon specimens, but were not found in Persian sturgeons. This confirms genetic isolation of the Persian sturgeon from the Russian sturgeon in the Caspian Sea. However, in order to clarify the relationships of these species it is necessary to analyze nuclear DNA markers. The amplified fragment length polymorphism (method) allows estimating interpopulation and interspecific genetic distances using nuclear DNA markers. In the present study, four samples were compared: Persian sturgeons from the South Caspian Sea, Russian sturgeons from the Caspian Sea and the Sea of Azov, and Siberian sturgeons from the Ob\u2019 River, which are close to these two species, but are also clearly morphologically and genetically distinct from them. For the AFLP method, eight pairs of selective primers were used. The analysis revealed that the Siberian sturgeon has formed a separate branch from the overall Persian-Russian sturgeons cluster, which was an expected result. In addition, the results showed that the Caspian Russian sturgeon is closer to the Persian sturgeon from the Caspian Sea than to the Russian Sturgeon from the Sea of Azov. The present DNA marker data confirm that despite the genetic isolation of the Persian sturgeon from the Russian sturgeon in the Caspian Sea, the Persian sturgeon is a young species.', u'/articles/5-2807/v1', ['Plant Biology, Ecology & Environmental Sciences'], [u'The Laboratory of Molecular Genetic Identification of Hydrobionts, Russian Federal Research Institute of Fisheries and Oceanography, Moscow, Russian Federation']]
