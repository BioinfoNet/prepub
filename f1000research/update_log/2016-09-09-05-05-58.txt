[u'Method-centered digital communities on protocols.io for fast-paced scientific innovation', ['Lori Kindler', 'Alexei Stoliartchouk', 'Leonid Teytelman', 'Bonnie L. Hurwitz'], u'08 Sep 2016', u'The Internet has enabled online social interaction for scientists that previously happened only in physical meetings and conferences. Yet despite these innovations in communication, dissemination of methods is often relegated to the slow process of academic publishing. Further, these methods remain static, with subsequent advances published elsewhere and unlinked. For communities undergoing fast-paced innovation, researchers need new capabilities to share, obtain feedback, and publish methods at the forefront of scientific development. For example, a renaissance in virology is now underway given the new metagenomic methods to sequence viral DNA directly from an environment. Metagenomics makes it possible to \u201csee\u201d natural viral communities that could not be previously studied through culturing methods. Yet, the knowledge of specialized techniques for the production and analysis of viral metagenomes remains in a subset of labs.\xa0 This problem is common to any community using and developing emerging technologies and techniques. We developed new capabilities to create virtual communities in protocols.io, an open access platform, for disseminating protocols and knowledge at the forefront of scientific development. To demonstrate these capabilities, we present a virology community forum called VERVENet. These new features allow virology researchers to share protocols and their annotations and optimizations, connect with the broader virtual community to share knowledge, job postings, conference announcements through a common online forum, and discover the current literature through personalized recommendations to promote discussion of cutting edge research. Virtual communities in protocols.io enhance a researcher\u2019s ability to: discuss and share protocols, connect with fellow community members, and learn about new and innovative research in the field.\xa0 The web-based software for developing virtual communities is free to use on protocols.io.

[u'An annotation of cuts, depicted locations, and temporal progression in the motion picture "Forrest Gump"', ['Christian O. Hausler', 'Michael Hanke'], u'08 Sep 2016', u'Here we present an annotation of locations and temporal progression depicted in\xa0the movie \u201cForrest Gump\u201d, as an addition to a large public functional brain imaging\xa0dataset (http://studyforrest.org). The annotation provides information\xa0about the exact timing of each of the 870 shots, and the depicted location after every\xa0cut with a high, medium, and low level of abstraction. Additionally, four classes are\xa0used to distinguish the differences of the depicted time between shots. Each shot is\xa0also annotated regarding the type of location (interior/exterior) and time of day. This\xa0annotation enables further studies of visual perception, memory of locations, and\xa0the perception of time under conditions of real-life complexity using the studyforrest\xa0dataset.', u'/articles/5-2273/v1', ['Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry'], [u'Psychoinformatics Lab, Department of Psychology, University of Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany', u'Center for Behavioral Brain Sciences, Magdeburg, Germany']]
[u'Reduced neuronal size and mTOR pathway activity in the Mecp2 A140V Rett syndrome mouse model', ['Sampathkumar Rangasamy', 'Shannon Olfers', 'Brittany Gerald', 'Alex Hilbert', 'Sean Svejda', 'Vinodh Narayanan'], u'08 Sep 2016', u'Rett syndrome\xa0(RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutation in the X-linked MECP2 gene, encoding methyl-CpG-binding protein 2. We have created a mouse model (Mecp2 A140V \u201cknock-in\u201d mutant) expressing the recurrent human MECP2 A140V mutation linked to an X-linked mental retardation/Rett syndrome phenotype. Morphological analyses focused on quantifying soma and nucleus size were performed on primary hippocampus and cerebellum granule neuron (CGN) cultures from mutant (Mecp2A140V/y) and wild type (Mecp2+/y) male mice. Cultured hippocampus and cerebellar granule neurons from mutant animals were significantly smaller than neurons from wild type animals. We also examined soma size in hippocampus neurons from individual female transgenic mice that express both a mutant\xa0 (maternal allele) and a wild type Mecp2 gene linked to an eGFP transgene (paternal allele). In cultures from such doubly heterozygous female mice, the size of neurons expressing the mutant (A140V) allele also showed a significant reduction compared to neurons expressing wild type MeCP2, supporting a cell-autonomous role for MeCP2 in neuronal development. IGF-1 (insulin growth factor-1) treatment of neuronal cells from Mecp2 mutant mice rescued the soma size phenotype. We also found that Mecp2\xa0 mutation leads to down-regulation of the mTOR signaling pathway, known to be involved in neuronal size regulation. Our results suggest that i) reduced neuronal size is an important in vitro cellular phenotype of Mecp2 mutation in mice, and ii) MeCP2 might play a critical role in the maintenance of neuronal structure by modulation of the mTOR pathway. The definition of a quantifiable cellular phenotype supports using neuronal size as a biomarker in the development of a high-throughput, in vitro assay to screen for compounds that rescue small neuronal phenotype (\u201cphenotypic assay\u201d).', u'/articles/5-2269/v1', ['Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry', 'Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology'], [u'Neurogenomics Division, Translational Genomics Research Institute, Phoenix, USA', u'Center for Rare Childhood Disorders, Translational Genomics Research Institute, Phoenix, USA', u'Barrow Neurological Institute, St.Joseph\u2019s Hospital and Medical Center, Phoenix, USA', u'School of Life Sciences, Arizona State University, Tempe, USA']]
