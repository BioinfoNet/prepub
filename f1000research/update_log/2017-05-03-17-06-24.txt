[u'A putative antiviral role of plant cytidine deaminases', ['Susana Martin', 'Jose M. Cuevas', 'Ana Grande-Perez', 'Santiago F Elena'], u'03 May 2017', u'Background: A mechanism of innate antiviral immunity operating against viruses infecting mammalian cells has been described during the last decade.\xa0 Host cytidine deaminases (e.g., APOBEC3 proteins) edit viral genomes, giving rise to hypermutated nonfunctional viruses; consequently, viral fitness is reduced through lethal mutagenesis.\xa0 By contrast, sub-lethal hypermutagenesis may contribute to virus evolvability by increasing population diversity.\xa0 To prevent genome editing, some viruses have evolved proteins that mediate APOBEC3 degradation.\xa0 The model plant Arabidopsis thaliana genome encodes nine cytidine deaminases (AtCDAs), raising the question of whether deamination is an antiviral mechanism in plants as well.\r\nMethods: Here we tested the effects of expression of AtCDAs on the pararetrovirus Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV). Two different experiments were carried out. First, we transiently overexpressed each one of the nine A. thaliana AtCDA genes in Nicotiana bigelovii plants infected with CaMV, and characterized the resulting mutational spectra, comparing them with those generated under normal conditions.\xa0 Secondly, we created A. thaliana transgenic plants expressing an artificial microRNA designed to knock-out the expression of up to six AtCDA genes. \xa0This and control plants were then infected with CaMV.\xa0 Virus accumulation and mutational spectra where characterized in both types of plants.\r\nResults: \xa0We have shown that the A. thaliana AtCDA1 gene product exerts a mutagenic activity, significantly increasing the number of G to A mutations in vivo, with a concomitant reduction in the amount of CaMV genomes accumulated.\xa0 Furthermore, the magnitude of this mutagenic effect on CaMV accumulation is positively correlated with the level of AtCDA1 mRNA expression in the plant.\r\nConclusions: Our results suggest that deamination of viral genomes may also work as an antiviral mechanism in plants.', u'/articles/6-622/v1', ['Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases', 'Plant Biology, Ecology & Environmental Sciences'], [u'Instituto de Biolog\xeda Molecular y Celular de Plantas (IBMCP), CSIC-Universidad Polit\xe9cnica de Val\xe8ncia, Campus UPV CPI 8E, Ingeniero Fausto Elio s/n, 46022 Val\xe8ncia, Spain', u'Instituto de Biolog\xeda Integrativa y de Sistemas (I2SysBio), CSIC-Universitat de Val\xe8ncia, Parc Cient\xedfic UV, Catedr\xe1tico Agust\xedn Escardino 9, 46980 Paterna, Val\xe8ncia, Spain', u'Instituto de Hortofruticultura Subtropical y Mediterr\xe1nea \u201cLa Mayora\u201d, CSIC-Universidad de M\xe1laga, Campus de Teatinos, 29071 M\xe1laga, Spain', u'\xc1rea de Gen\xe9tica, Universidad de M\xe1laga, Campus de Teatinos, 29071 M\xe1laga, Spain', u'The Santa Fe Institute, 1399 Hyde Park Road, Santa Fe, NM, 87501, USA']]
[u'Efficacy of an 8-week course of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir for the treatment of HCV infection in selected HIV-infected patients', ['Onyema Ogbuagu', 'Ritche Hao', 'Michael Virata', 'Merceditas S. Villanueva', 'Maricar Malinis'], u'03 May 2017', u'Background: With the availability of direct acting antiviral treatment for hepatitis C (HCV), HIV and HCV co-infected patients show comparable treatment responses to HCV-monoinfected patients. An 8-week course of sofosbuvir/ledipasvir (SOF/LDV) is highly effective for the treatment of HCV genotype 1 infection in treatment-na\xefve mono-infected patients with HCV viral loads <6 million IU/ml. There is limited data on the efficacy of this 8-week HCV treatment regimen in HIV-infected individuals with similar viral loads.\nMethods: The study was a retrospective review of HIV-infected adults coinfected with HCV genotype 1 for whom an 8-week course of SOF/LDV was prescribed by providers at two clinics in the Yale-New Haven health system from November 1, 2014 until April 30, 2016. Treatment efficacy was assessed as the proportion of treatment initiators who achieved a sustained virologic response 12 weeks after completion of therapy (SVR 12).\nResults: Nineteen patients met study eligibility criteria and included 14 men (74%); and 12 African-Americans (63%). All patients were on antiretroviral therapy with fully suppressed HIV viral loads and were HCV treatment-na\xefve. All patients had pre-treatment HCV viral loads <6 million IU/mL. Eighteen patients (95%) completed HCV treatment. Overall, SVR 12 was 95%, with 1 treament failure occurring due to suboptimal adherence.\nConclusion: Among our HIV-infected patient cohort with HCV genotype 1 infection, 95% of those treated with an 8 week course of SOF/LDV achieved SVR 12. This is comparable to the efficacy of the same treatment regimen in patients without HIV infection. This study lends proof of concept to the use of shorter course SOF/LDV treatment for HIV-HCV genotype 1 coinfected patients with viral loads <6 million IU/ml.

Murphy', 'Ethan J. Weiss'], u'03 May 2017', u'Background: Growth hormone (GH) is known to affect insulin and glucose metabolism.\xa0 Blocking its effects in acromegalic patients improves diabetes and glucose metabolism. We aimed to determine the effect of pegvisomant, a GH receptor antagonist, on insulin resistance, endogenous glucose production (EGP) and lipolysis in insulin resistant non-diabetic men.\xa0\nMethods: Four men between the ages of 18-62 with a BMI of 18-35kg/m2, with insulin resistance as defined by a HOMA-IR > 2.77, were treated for four weeks with pegvisomant 20 mg daily.\xa0 Inpatient metabolic assessments were performed before and after treatment. The main outcome measurements were: change after pegvisomant therapy in insulin sensitivity as measured by hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp; and EGP and lipolysis assessed by stable isotope tracer techniques.\nResults: Insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) concentrations decreased from 134.0 \xb1 41.5 (mean \xb1 SD) to 72.0 \xb1 11.7 ng/mL (p = 0.04) after 4 weeks of therapy. Whole body insulin sensitivity index (M/I 3.2 \xb1 1.3 vs. 3.4 \xb1 2.4; P = 0.82), as well as suppression of EGP (89.7 \xb1 26.9 vs. 83.5 \xb1 21.6%; p = 0.10) and Ra glycerol (59.4 \xb1 22.1% vs. 61.2 \xb1 14.4%; p = 0.67) during the clamp were not changed significantly with pegvisomant treatment.\nConclusions: Blockade of the GH receptor with pegvisomant for four weeks had no significant effect on insulin/glucose metabolism in a small phase II pilot study of non-diabetic insulin resistant participants without acromegaly.', u'/articles/6-614/v1', ['Endocrinology & Gastroenterology'], [u'Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, 94143, USA', u'Division of Endocrinology, San Francisco General Hospital, San Francisco, CA, 94110, USA', u'Division of Cardiology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, 94143, USA', u'Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, 94143, USA']]

Ferguson'], u'03 May 2017', u'Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most significant male health concerns worldwide. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are becoming increasingly strong candidate biomarkers for identifying susceptibility to PCa. We identified a number of SNPs reported in genome-wide association analyses (GWAS) as risk factors for aggressive PCa in various European populations, and then defined SNP-SNP interactions, using PLINK software, with nucleic acid samples from a New Zealand cohort. We used this approach to find a gene x environment marker for aggressive PCa, as although statistically gene x environment interactions can be adjusted for, it is highly impossible in practicality, and thus must be incorporated in the search for a reliable biomarker for PCa.

Spaink'], u'03 May 2017', u'Background: The introduction of the MinIONTM sequencing device by Oxford Nanopore Technologies may greatly accelerate whole genome sequencing. It has been shown that the nanopore sequence data, in combination with other sequencing technologies, is highly useful for accurate annotation of all genes in the genome. However, it also offers great potential for de novo assembly of complex genomes without using other technologies. In this manuscript we used nanopore sequencing as a tool to classify yeast strains.\nMethods: We compared various technical and software developments for the nanopore sequencing protocol, showing that the R9 chemistry is, as predicted, higher in quality than R7.3 chemistry. The R9 chemistry is an essential improvement for assembly of the extremely AT-rich mitochondrial genome.\nResults: In this study, we used this new technology to sequence and de novo assemble the genome of a recently isolated ethanologenic yeast strain, and compared the results with those obtained by classical Illumina short read sequencing. This strain was originally named Candida vartiovaarae (Torulopsis vartiovaarae) based on ribosomal RNA sequencing. We show that the assembly using nanopore data is much more contiguous than the assembly using short read data.\nConclusions: The mitochondrial and chromosomal genome sequences showed that our strain is clearly distinct from other yeast taxons and most closely related to published Cyberlindnera species.
