[u'Where are the female science professors? A personal perspective', ['Shina Caroline Lynn Kamerlin'], u'06 Jun 2016', u'The first woman to earn a Professorship at a University in Europe was Laura Maria Caterina Bassi, who earned a professorship in physics at the University of Bologna in 1732. Almost 300 years and three waves of feminism later, in 2016, women typically still only comprise 20% (or less) of the number of full professors in Europe. This opinion article will discuss the experiences of being a female academic today and the factors contributing to the academic gender gap from the perspective of a \u201cyoung\u201d natural scientist, as well as providing constructive suggestions for strategies to empower women in the academic world.', u'/articles/5-1224/v1', ['Publishing, Education & Communication'], [u'Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, S-751, Sweden']]
[u'Analyzing compound activity records and promiscuity degrees in light of publication statistics', ['Ye Hu', 'Jurgen Bajorath'], u'06 Jun 2016', u'For the generation of contemporary databases of bioactive compounds, activity information is usually extracted from the scientific literature. However, when activity data are analyzed, source publications are typically no longer taken into consideration. Therefore, compound activity data selected from ChEMBL were traced back to thousands of original publications, activity records including compound, assay, and target information were systematically generated, and their distributions across the literature were determined. In addition, publications were categorized on the basis of activity records. Furthermore, compound promiscuity, defined as the ability of small molecules to specifically interact with multiple target proteins, was analyzed in light of publication statistics, thus adding another layer of information to promiscuity assessment. It was shown that the degree of compound promiscuity was not influenced by increasing numbers of source publications. Rather, most non-promiscuous as well as promiscuous compounds, regardless of their degree of promiscuity, originated from single publications, which emerged as a characteristic feature of the medicinal chemistry literature.', u'/articles/5-1227/v1', ['Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'Department of Life Science Informatics, B-IT, LIMES Program Unit Chemical Biology and Medicinal Chemistry, Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit\xe4t, Bonn, D-53113, Germany']]
