[u'Toxic epidermal necrolysis', ['Wolfram Hoetzenecker', 'Tarun Mehra', 'Ieva Saulite', 'Martin Glatz', 'Peter Schmid-Grendelmeier', 'Emmanuella Guenova', 'Antonio Cozzio', 'Lars E. French'], u'20 May 2016', u'Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a rare, life-threatening drug-induced skin disease with a mortality rate of approximately 30%. The clinical hallmark of TEN is a marked skin detachment caused by extensive keratinocyte cell death associated with mucosal involvement. The exact pathogenic mechanism of TEN is still uncertain. Recent advances in this field have led to the identification of several factors that might contribute to the induction of excessive apoptosis of keratinocytes. In addition, specific human leukocyte antigen types seem to be associated with certain drugs and the development of TEN. As well-controlled studies are lacking, patients are treated with various immunomodulators (e.g. intravenous immunoglobulin) in addition to the best supportive care.', u'/articles/5-951/v1', ['Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases', 'Oncology & Hematology', 'Dermatology', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'Department of Dermatology, University Hospital of Z\xfcrich, Z\xfcrich, Switzerland', u'Medical Directorate, University Hospital of Z\xfcrich, Z\xfcrich, Switzerland', u'Riga Stradins University, Riga, Latvia']]
[u'Infrastructure for genomic interactions: Bioconductor classes for Hi-C, ChIA-PET and related experiments', ['Aaron T. L. Lun', 'Malcolm Perry', 'Elizabeth Ing-Simmons'], u'20 May 2016', u'The study of genomic interactions has been greatly facilitated by techniques such as chromatin conformation capture with high-throughput sequencing (Hi-C). These genome-wide experiments generate large amounts of data that require careful analysis to obtain useful biological conclusions. However, development of the appropriate software tools is hindered by the lack of basic infrastructure to represent and manipulate genomic interaction data. Here, we present the InteractionSet package that provides classes to represent genomic interactions and store their associated experimental data, along with the methods required for low-level manipulation and processing of those classes. The InteractionSet package exploits existing infrastructure in the open-source Bioconductor project, while in turn being used by Bioconductor packages designed for higher-level analyses. For new packages, use of the functionality in InteractionSet will simplify development, allow access to more features and improve interoperability between packages.', u'/articles/5-950/v1', ['Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK', u'MRC Clinical Sciences Centre, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK']]
