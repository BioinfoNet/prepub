[u"Recent advances in primary Sjogren's syndrome", ['Nicholas Holdgate', 'E. Wiliam St.Clair'], u'17 Jun 2016', u'Primary Sj\xf6gren\u2019s syndrome, a chronic inflammatory process, is among the most commonly occurring rheumatologic diseases. The clinical hallmark of this disease is exocrine gland dysfunction, resulting predominately in dry eyes and dry mouth. However, the disease often extends beyond the exocrine glands to seriously affect other organs systems, such as the lungs, kidneys, and nervous system. Moreover, patients with primary Sj\xf6gren\u2019s syndrome develop non-Hodgkin\u2019s B cell lymphoma at a substantially higher rate than the general population. New research has improved our understanding of disease mechanisms, with notable advances in our knowledge about the genetic susceptibility of disease, the molecular details of the chronic inflammatory response in the salivary glands, and the complex role of the type 1 interferon pathway. The pipeline of drugs under development for the treatment of primary Sj\xf6gren\u2019s syndrome is enriched with novel biologics and small molecular entities targeting the pathogenic process. Herein, we summarize the latest advances in elucidating the pathogenesis of primary Sj\xf6gren\u2019s syndrome and highlight new drugs in clinical development aiming to reverse the glandular dysfunction and favorably impact the systemic features of this disease.', u'/articles/5-1412/v1', ['Bone Disorders', 'Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases', 'Oncology & Hematology', 'Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'Department of Medicine, Division of Rheumatology and Immunology, School of Medicine, Duke University, Durham, NC, 27710, USA']]
[u'The changing faces of cholangitis', ['Sum P. Lee', 'Joseph R. Roberts', 'Rahul Kuver'], u'17 Jun 2016', u'A variety of diseases are included under the umbrella term \u2018cholangitis\u2019, including hepatobiliary diseases with an autoimmune pathogenesis (such as primary sclerosing cholangitis, primary biliary cholangitis, and IgG4-associated sclerosing cholangitis) and disease processes associated with intraductal stones and infectious etiologies (such as ascending bacterial cholangitis, recurrent pyogenic cholangitis, and liver fluke-associated cholangitis). Recent advances in the pathophysiologic bases of these disorders, particularly with respect to the autoimmune variety, are allowing improved diagnosis and prognostication as well as providing the opportunity to refine and re-imagine treatment modalities. The aim of this review is to highlight selected advances in cholangitis research that point to novel insights into the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of this diverse array of disorders.', u'/articles/5-1409/v1', ['Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases', 'Endocrinology & Gastroenterology', 'Oncology & Hematology', 'Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'Department of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology , University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA, USA']]
[u'Case Report: Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease: a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma following pretransplant nephrectomy for a 2.35 Kg kidney', ['Arvind P. Ganpule', 'Jaspreet Singh Chabra', 'Abhishek G. Singh', 'Gopal R. Tak', 'Shailesh Soni', 'Ravindra Sabnis', 'Mahesh Desai'], u'17 Jun 2016', u'Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease (KFD) is an extremely rare disease with a worldwide distribution and higher prevalence in Asians. It is a benign and self-limiting disorder, characterized by regional cervical lymphadenopathy accompanied with mild fever and night sweats. Lymph node histopathology is diagnostic and treating physicians should be aware of this entity as it may mimic other systemic diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus, tuberculosis, malignant lymphoma, and more rarely adenocarcinoma. Key features on lymph node biopsy are fragmentation, necrosis and karyorrhexis.\r\nTreatment includes symptomatic care, analgesics-antipyretics, corticosteroids and spontaneous recovery occurs in 1 to 4 months. We report a case of adult polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) with end stage renal disease and episodes of fever and cervical lymphadenopathy. The infectious screen was negative and on extensive workup, the patient was found to have histiocytic-necrotizing lymphadenitis, which clinched the diagnosis of KFD.', u'/articles/5-1407/v1', ['Hepatology & Nephrology', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'Muljibhai Patel Urological Hospital, Nadiad, Gujarat, 387001, India']]
[u'RNA-seq analysis is easy as 1-2-3 with limma, Glimma and edgeR', ['Charity W. Law', 'Monther Alhamdoosh', 'Shian Su', 'Gordon K. Smyth', 'Matthew E. Ritchie'], u'17 Jun 2016', u'The ability to easily and efficiently analyse RNA-sequencing data is a key strength of the Bioconductor project. Starting with counts summarised at the gene-level, a typical analysis involves pre-processing, exploratory data analysis, differential expression testing and pathway analysis with the results obtained informing future experiments and validation studies. In this workflow article, we analyse RNA-sequencing data from the mouse mammary gland, demonstrating use of the popular edgeR package to import, organise, filter and normalise the data, followed by the limma package with its voom method, linear modelling and empirical Bayes moderation to assess differential expression and perform gene set testing. This pipeline is further enhanced by the Glimma package which enables interactive exploration of the results so that individual samples and genes can be examined by the user. The complete analysis offered by these three packages highlights the ease with which researchers can turn the raw counts from an RNA-sequencing experiment into biological insights using Bioconductor.', u'/articles/5-1408/v1', ['Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, 3052, Australia', u'Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, 3010, Australia', u'CSL Limited, Parkville, Victoria, 3010, Australia', u'School of Mathematics and Statistics, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, 3010, Australia']]
[u'ddpcr: an R package and web application for analysis of droplet digital PCR data', ['Dean Attali', 'Roza Bidshahri', 'Charles Haynes', 'Jennifer Bryan'], u'17 Jun 2016', u'Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) is a novel platform for exact quantification of DNA which holds great promise in clinical diagnostics. It is increasingly popular due to its digital nature, which provides more accurate quantification and higher sensitivity than traditional real-time PCR. However, clinical adoption has been slowed in part by the lack of software tools available for analyzing ddPCR data. Here, we present ddpcr \u2013 a new R package for ddPCR visualization and analysis. In addition, ddpcr includes a web application (powered by the Shiny R package) that allows users to analyze ddPCR data using an interactive graphical interface.', u'/articles/5-1411/v1', ['Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'Bioinformatics Training Program, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada', u'Michael Smith Laboratories, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada', u'Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada', u'Department of Statistics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada']]
