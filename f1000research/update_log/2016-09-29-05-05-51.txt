[u'Maternal complications in a geographically challenging and hard to reach district of Bangladesh: a qualitative study', ['Animesh Biswas', 'Koustuv Dalal', 'Abu Sayeed Md Abdullah', 'Mervyn Gifford', 'MA Halim'], u'28 Sep 2016', u'Background: Maternal complications contribute to maternal deaths in developing countries. Bangladesh still has a high prevalence of maternal mortality, which is often preventable. There are some geographically challenging and hard to reach rural districts in Bangladesh and it is difficult to get information about maternal complications in these areas. In this study, we examined the community lay knowledge of possible pregnancy complications. We also examined the common practices\xa0associated with complications and we discuss the challenges for the community.\nMethods: The study was conducted in Moulvibazar of north east Bangladesh, a geographically challenged, difficult to reach district. Qualitative methods were used to collect the information. Pregnant women, mothers who had recently delivered, their guardians and traditional birth attendants participated in focus group discussions. Additionally, in-depth interviews were conducted with the family members. Thematic analyses were performed.\nResults: The study revealed that there is a lack of knowledge of maternal complications. In the majority of cases, the mothers did not receive proper treatment for maternal complications. \xa0\r\nThere are significant challenges that these rural societies need to address: problems of ignorance, traditional myths and family restrictions on seeking better treatment. Moreover, traditional birth attendants and village doctors also have an important role in assuring appropriate, effective and timely treatment.\nConclusions: \xa0The rural community lacks adequate knowledge on maternal complications.\xa0 Reduction of the societal barriers including barriers within the family can improve overall practices. Moreover, dissemination of adequate information to the traditional birth attendant and village doctors may improve the overall situation, which would eventually help to reduce maternal deaths.', u'/articles/5-2417/v1', ['Public Health & Epidemiology'], [u'School of Health Sciences, \xd6rebro University, \xd6rebro, Sweden', u'Centre for Injury Prevention and Research (CIPRB), Dhaka, Bangladesh']]
[u'Breeding novel solutions in the brain: a model of Darwinian neurodynamics', ['Andras Szilagyi', 'Istvan Zachar', 'Anna Fedor', 'Harold P. de Vladar', 'Eors Szathmary'], u'28 Sep 2016', u'Background: The fact that surplus connections and neurons are pruned during development is well established. We complement this selectionist picture by a proof-of-principle model of evolutionary search in the brain, that accounts for new variations in theory space. We present a model for Darwinian evolutionary search for candidate solutions in the brain.\nMethods: We combine known components of the brain \u2013 recurrent neural networks (acting as attractors), the action selection loop and implicit working memory \u2013 to provide the appropriate Darwinian architecture. We employ a population of attractor networks with palimpsest memory. The action selection loop is employed with winners-share-all dynamics to select for candidate solutions that are transiently stored in implicit working memory.\nResults: We document two processes: selection of stored solutions and evolutionary search for novel solutions. During the replication of candidate solutions attractor networks occasionally produce recombinant patterns, increasing variation on which selection can act. Combinatorial search acts on multiplying units (activity patterns) with hereditary variation and novel variants appear due to (i)\xa0noisy recall of patterns from the attractor networks, (ii)\xa0noise during transmission of candidate solutions as messages between networks, and, (iii)\xa0spontaneously generated, untrained patterns in spurious attractors.\nConclusions: Attractor dynamics of recurrent neural networks can be used to model Darwinian search. The proposed architecture can be used for fast search among stored solutions (by selection) and for evolutionary search when novel candidate solutions are generated in successive iterations. Since all the suggested components are present in advanced nervous systems, we hypothesize that the brain could implement a truly evolutionary combinatorial search system, capable of generating novel variants.', u'/articles/5-2416/v1', ['Eye Disorders & ENT', 'Development & Evolution', 'Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry'], [u'MTA-ELTE Theoretical Biology and Evolutionary Ecology Research Group, Budapest, H-1117, Hungary', u'Department of Plant Systematics, Ecology and Theoretical Biology, Institute of Biology, E\xf6tv\xf6s University, Budapest, H-1117, Hungary', u'Parmenides Center for the Conceptual Foundations of Science, Munich/Pullach, 82049, Germany', u'Institute of Advanced Studies, K\u0151szeg, H-9730, Hungary']]
[u'Pattern of triple negative epithelial ovarian cancer in indigenous African women', ['Mustapha Akanji Ajani', 'Ayodeji Akeem Salami', 'Olutosin Alaba Awolude', 'Abideen Olayiwola Oluwasola'], u'28 Sep 2016', u'Background: Triple negative epithelial ovarian cancer (TNEOC)\xa0 refers to ovarian carcinomas that do not express estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor- type 2 (HER-2/neu).\xa0 The aim of this study is to determine the pattern of triple negative epithelial ovarian cancer in indigenous African women.\n\nMethods: We performed a retrospective review of ER, PR and HER-2/neu expression in 90 Nigerian patients with histologically diagnosed epithelial ovarian cancer. Lack of expression of ER, PR and HER2/neu antigens was used to determine carcinomas that are among the TNEOC. We also compared the clinicopathological parameters (age, International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage, grade and histological subtype) in patients with TNEOC and non- TNEOC\xa0.\n\nResults: Thirty-eight (42.2%) of the 90 tumours diagnosed as EOC were negative for ER, PR and HER2/neu expression. There was no significant association between TNEOC with other parameters such as age, FIGO stage and histological grade. Sixteen (66.7%) of the 24 mucinous carcinomas were triple negative, while only 21 (33.3%) of the 63 serous carcinomas were triple-negative and one (50%) of the two endometrioid carcinomas was triple negative. There was a significant association between triple-negative tumours and histological subtypes of EOC (p = 0.034).\n\nConclusions: A subtype of epithelial ovarian cancer that is negative for ER, PR and HER-2/neu has been discovered in indigenous African women. TNEOC expression is high and is comparable to the triple negative breast cancer subtype seen in people of African ancestry. Future study of TNEOC in a large sample size should be considered.', u'/articles/5-2415/v1', ['Oncology & Hematology', 'Urology, Gynecology & Obstetrics'], [u'Department of Pathology, University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria', u'Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria']]
