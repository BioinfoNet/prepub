[u'The ISMARA client', ['Panu Artimo', 'Severine Duvaud', 'Mikhail Pachkov', 'Vassilios Ioannidis', 'Erik van Nimwegen', 'Heinz Stockinger'], u'15 Dec 2016', u"ISMARA (ismara.unibas.ch) automatically infers the key regulators and regulatory interactions from high-throughput gene expression or chromatin state data. However, given the large sizes of current next generation sequencing (NGS) datasets, data uploading times are a major bottleneck. Additionally, for proprietary data, users may be uncomfortable with uploading entire raw datasets to an external server. Both these problems could be alleviated by providing a means by which users could pre-process their raw data locally, transferring only a small summary file to the ISMARA server. We developed a stand-alone client application that pre-processes large input files (RNA-seq or ChIP-seq data) on the user's computer for performing ISMARA analysis in a completely automated manner, including uploading of small processed summary files to the ISMARA server. This reduces file sizes by up to a factor of 1000, and upload times from many hours to mere seconds. The client application is available from ismara.unibas.ch/ISMARA/client.", u'/articles/5-2851/v1', ['Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Lausanne, Switzerland', u'Biozentrum, University of Basel & SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Basel, Switzerland']]
