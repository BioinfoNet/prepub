[u'Hospital and patient influencing factors of treatment schemes given to type 2 diabetes mellitus inpatients in Inner Mongolia, China', ['Nan Zhang', 'Edward McNeil', 'Sawitri Assanangkornchai', 'Yancun Fan'], u'05 Jul 2016', u'Background:\r\nIn clinical practice, the physician\u2019s treatment decision making is influenced by many factors besides the patient\u2019s clinical conditions and is the fundamental cause of healthcare inequity and discrimination in healthcare settings. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic disease with high prevalence, long average length of stay and high hospitalization rate. Although the treatment of T2DM is well guideline driven, there is a large body of evidence showing the existence of treatment disparities. More empirical studies from the provider side are needed to determine if non-clinical factors influence physician\u2019s treatment choices.\r\n\xa0\nObjective:\r\nTo determine the hospital and patient influencing factors of treatment schemes given to T2DM inpatients in Inner Mongolia, China.\r\n\xa0\nMethods:\r\nA cross-sectional, hospital-based survey using a cluster sampling technique was conducted in three tertiary hospitals and three county hospitals in Inner Mongolia, China. Treatment schemes were categorized as lifestyle management, oral therapy or insulin therapy according to the national guideline. Socio-demographic characteristics and variables related to severity of disease at the individual level and hospital level were collected. Weighted multinomial logistic regression models were used to determine influencing factors of treatment schemes.\r\n\xa0\nResults:\r\nRegardless of patients\u2019 clinical conditions and health insurance types, both hospital and patient level variables were associated with treatment schemes. Males were more likely to be given oral therapy (RRR=1.72, 95% CI=1.06-2.81) and insulin therapy (RRR=1.94, 95% CI=1.29-2.91) compared to females who were given lifestyle management more frequently. Compared to the western region, hospitals in the central regions of Inner Mongolia were less likely to prescribe T2DM patients oral therapy (RRR = 0.18, 95% CI=0.05-0.61) and insulin therapy (RRR = 0.20, 95% CI=0.06-0.67) than lifestyle management. Compared with non-reformed tertiary hospitals, reformed tertiary hospitals and county hospitals were less likely to give T2DM patients oral therapy (RRR = 0.07 and 0.1 respectively) and insulin therapy (RRR = 0.11 and 0.17 respectively).\r\n\xa0\nConclusion:\r\nGender was the only socio-demographic factors associated with treatment scheme for T2DM patients. Hospitals from different regions have different T2DM treatment patterns. Implementation of reform was shown to be associated with controlling medication use for T2DM inpatients. Further studies are needed to investigate the causes of unreasonable treatment disparities so that policies can be generated accordingly.', u'/articles/5-1577/v1', ['Public Health & Epidemiology', 'Endocrinology & Gastroenterology'], [u'School of Health Management, Inner Mongolia Medical University, Inner Mongolia, China', u'Epidemiology Unit, Faculty of Medicine, Prince of Songkla University, Hat Yai, Songkla, Thailand']]
[u'An open RNA-Seq data analysis pipeline tutorial with an example of reprocessing data from a recent Zika virus study', ['Zichen Wang', "Avi Ma'ayn"], u'05 Jul 2016', u'RNA-seq analysis is becoming a standard method for global gene expression profiling. However, open and standard pipelines to perform RNA-seq analysis by non-experts remain challenging due to the large size of the raw data files and the hardware requirements for running the alignment step. Here we introduce a reproducible open source RNA-seq pipeline delivered as an IPython notebook and a Docker image. The pipeline uses state-of-the-art tools and can run on various platforms with minimal configuration overhead. The pipeline enables the extraction of knowledge from typical RNA-seq studies by generating interactive principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering (HC) plots, performing enrichment analyses against over 90 gene set libraries, and obtaining lists of small molecules that are predicted to either mimic or reverse the observed changes in mRNA expression. We apply the pipeline to a recently published RNA-seq dataset collected from human neuronal progenitors infected with the Zika virus (ZIKV). In addition to confirming the presence of cell cycle genes among the genes that are downregulated by ZIKV, our analysis uncovers significant overlap with upregulated genes that when knocked out in mice induce defects in brain morphology. This result potentially points to the molecular processes associated with the microcephaly phenotype observed in newborns from pregnant mothers infected with the virus. In addition, our analysis predicts small molecules that can either mimic or reverse the expression changes induced by ZIKV.

Sight threatening diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy and age related macular degeneration have contributed to the 40% increase in outpatient attendances in the last decade but are amenable to early detection and monitoring. With early and appropriate intervention, blindness may be prevented in many cases.\r\n\xa0\r\nOphthalmic imaging provides a way to diagnose and objectively assess the progression of a number of pathologies including neovascular (\u201cwet\u201d) age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) and diabetic retinopathy. Two methods of imaging are commonly used: digital photographs of the fundus (the \u2018back\u2019 of the eye) and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT, a modality that uses light waves in a similar way to how ultrasound uses sound waves). Changes in population demographics and expectations and the changing pattern of chronic diseases creates a rising demand for such imaging. Meanwhile, interrogation of such images is time consuming, costly, and prone to human error. The application of novel analysis methods may provide a solution to these challenges.\r\n\xa0\r\nThis research will focus on applying novel machine learning algorithms to automatic analysis of both digital fundus photographs and OCT in Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust patients.\r\n\xa0\r\nThrough analysis of the images used in ophthalmology, along with relevant clinical and demographic information, Google DeepMind Health will investigate the feasibility of automated grading of digital fundus photographs and OCT and provide novel quantitative measures for specific disease features and for monitoring the therapeutic success.', u'/articles/5-1573/v1', ['Eye Disorders & ENT', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'Google DeepMind, London, EC4A 3TW, UK', u'Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London, EC1V 2PD, UK', u'Alexandra House University College London, Bloomsbury Campus, London, WC1N 3AR, UK', u'Department of Applied Heath Research, University College London, London, WC1E 7HB, UK', u'Institute of Sport, Exercise and Health, London, W1T 7HA, UK']]
