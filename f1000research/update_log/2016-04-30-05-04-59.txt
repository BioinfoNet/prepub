[u'Recent advances in echocardiography: strain and strain rate imaging', ['Oana Mirea', 'Jurgen Duchenne', 'Jens-Uwe Voigt'], u'29 Apr 2016', u'Deformation imaging by echocardiography is a well-established research tool which has been gaining interest from clinical cardiologists since the introduction of speckle tracking. Post-processing of echo images to analyze deformation has become readily available at the fingertips of the user. New parameters such as global longitudinal strain have been shown to provide added diagnostic value, and ongoing efforts of the imaging societies and industry aimed at harmonizing methods will improve the technique further. This review focuses on recent advances in the field of echocardiographic strain and strain rate imaging, and provides an overview on its current and potential future clinical applications.', u'/articles/5-787/v1', ['Cardiopulmonary & Vascular Disorders', 'Critical Care & Emergency Medicine'], [u'Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, KU Leuven \u2013 University of Leuven, Herestraat, Leuven, Belgium', u'Department of Cardiovascular Diseases, UZ Leuven \u2013 University Hospitals Leuven, Herestraat, Leuven, Belgium']]
[u'Time for sharing data to become routine: the seven excuses for not doing so are all invalid', ['Richard Smith', 'Ian Roberts'], u'29 Apr 2016', u'Data are more valuable than scientific papers but researchers are incentivised to publish papers not share data. Patients are the main beneficiaries of data sharing but researchers have several incentives not to share: others might use their data to get ahead in the academic rat race; they might be scooped; their results might not be replicable; competitors may reach different conclusions; their data management might be exposed as poor; patient confidentiality might be breached; and technical difficulties make sharing impossible. All of these barriers can be overcome and researchers should be rewarded for sharing data.

[u'Irritable bowel syndrome: new insights into symptom mechanisms and advances in treatment', ['Robin Spiller'], u'29 Apr 2016', u'Despite being one of the most common conditions leading to gastroenterological referral, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is poorly understood. However, recent years have seen major advances. These include new understanding of the role of both inflammation and altered microbiota as well as the impact of dietary intolerances as illuminated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which has thrown new light on IBS. This article will review new data on how excessive bile acid secretion mediates diarrhea and evidence from post infectious IBS which has shown how gut inflammation can alter gut microbiota and function. Studies of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have also shown that even when inflammation is in remission, the altered enteric nerves and abnormal microbiota can generate IBS-like symptoms. The efficacy of the low FODMAP diet as a treatment for bloating, flatulence, and abdominal discomfort has been demonstrated by randomized controlled trials. MRI studies, which can quantify intestinal volumes, have provided new insights into how FODMAPs cause symptoms. This article will focus on these areas together with recent trials of new agents, which this author believes will alter clinical practice within the foreseeable future.', u'/articles/5-780/v1', ['Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases', 'Endocrinology & Gastroenterology', 'Plant Biology, Ecology & Environmental Sciences', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'Nottingham Digestive Diseases Centre, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK']]
[u'Geroscience approaches to increase healthspan and slow aging', ['Simon Melov'], u'29 Apr 2016', u'For decades, researchers in the biology of aging have focused on defining mechanisms that modulate aging by primarily studying a single metric, sometimes described as the \u201cgold standard\u201d lifespan. Increasingly, geroscience research is turning towards defining functional domains of aging such as the cardiovascular system, skeletal integrity, and metabolic health as being a more direct route to understand why tissues decline in function with age. Each model used in aging research has strengths and weaknesses, yet we know surprisingly little about how critical tissues decline in health with increasing age. Here I discuss popular model systems used in geroscience research and their utility as possible tools in preclinical studies in aging.', u'/articles/5-785/v1', ['Development & Evolution', 'Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry', 'Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'Buck Institute for Research on Aging, Novato, CA, USA']]
[u'Rho, ROCK and actomyosin contractility in metastasis as drug targets', ['Irene Rodriguez-Hernandez', 'Gaia Cantelli', 'Fanshawe Bruce', 'Victoria Sanz-Moreno'], u'29 Apr 2016', u'Metastasis is the spread of cancer cells around the body and the cause of the majority of cancer deaths. Metastasis is a very complex process in which cancer cells need to dramatically modify their cytoskeleton and cope with different environments to successfully colonize a secondary organ. In this review, we discuss recent findings pointing at Rho-ROCK or actomyosin force (or both) as major drivers of many of the steps required for metastatic success. We propose that these are important drug targets that need to be considered in the clinic to palliate metastatic disease.', u'/articles/5-783/v1', ['Oncology & Hematology', 'Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'Tumour Plasticity Laboratory, Randall Division of Cell and Molecular Biophysics, Guy\u2019s Campus, King\u2019s College London, London, SE1 1UL, UK', u'Department of Imaging Chemistry and Biology, Division of Imaging Sciences and Biomedical Engineering, St. Thomas Hospital, King\u2019s College London, London, SE1 7EH, UK']]
[u'Recent advances in large-scale protein interactome mapping', ['Virja Mehta', 'Laura Trinkle-Mulcahy'], u'29 Apr 2016', u'Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) underlie most, if not all, cellular functions. The comprehensive mapping of these complex networks of stable and transient associations thus remains a key goal, both for systems biology-based initiatives (where it can be combined with other \u2018omics\u2019 data to gain a better understanding of functional pathways and networks) and for focused biological studies. Despite the significant challenges of such an undertaking, major strides have been made over the past few years. They include improvements in the computation prediction of PPIs and the literature curation of low-throughput studies of specific protein complexes, but also an increase in the deposition of high-quality data from non-biased high-throughput experimental PPI mapping strategies into publicly available databases.', u'/articles/5-782/v1', ['Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Ottawa Institute of Systems Biology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada']]
[u'Estimation of genomic ancestry in admixed populations', ['David A. Eccles', 'Geoffrey K. Chambers', 'Rodney A. Lea'], u'29 Apr 2016', u'Investigative studies of the genetic component of phenotypes are confounded by differential population structure in study groups. A particular challenge in such studies is trying to distinguish between inherited variants from ancestral populations and inherited variants near a causative locus. The native M\u0101ori\xa0population of New Zealand represent one of the last major migrations to previously uninhabited islands (about 600-800 years ago) and present an exciting opportunity to study recent ancestral population admixture in a large group of genetically similar individuals.A bootstrap sub-sampling method was utilised to generate a set of group-specific markers for the investigation of admixture within an iwi (M\u0101ori\xa0tribe) from Hawkes Bay, New Zealand. A validated set of 10 markers was constructed that estimates individual ancestral fraction with high accuracy (median = 98%, IQR = 95-99). These markers were used to determine the variation of M\u0101ori-European ancestral fraction within this tribe, together with an estimate of the amount of European ancestry in the population (28.7%).The generation of a panel of validated group-specific markers is possible even when using a low-density marker set and small sample group sizes. The bootstrap sub-sampling approach used here will be useful in the shift from group-membership (i.e. ethnicity) profiles to more personalised, gene-based prediction profiles.', u'/articles/5-779/v1', ['Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'School of Biological Sciences, Victoria University, Wellington, New Zealand', u'Environmental Science and Research, Porirua, New Zealand']]
