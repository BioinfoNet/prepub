[u'A cross sectional study to determine the prevalence and risk factors of low back pain among public technical institute staff in Kurdistan Region, Iraq', ['Karwan Mahmood Khudhir', 'Kochr  Ali Mahmood', 'Kochar Khasro Saleh', 'Mosharaf Hossain'], u'23 Feb 2017', u'There is a lack of quantitative data regarding exposure response relationships between low back pain (LBP) and associated risk factors among institute staff in Kurdistan Region, Iraq. This study explored such associations in an analytic cross-sectional study. Data collection was carried out with a self-administered questionnaire. A total of 70 (90%) institute staff from Koya Technical Institute (KTI) participated in this study. The findings indicated that 61.4% of KTI staff report LBP. Independent variables significantly associated with reporting LBP (P value <0.05) during past 12 months were smoking (OR=10.882; 95%CI=1.301-90.995) and job tenure (OR=3.159; 95% CI=1.072-9.312). In conclusion, LBP is significantly associated with smoking and years worked; therefore, workers should be educated on the effects of smoking not only as it relates to LBP, but also how it affects the whole body and how to quit it. This can be done through health promotion campaigns and programs sponsored by the university.', u'/articles/6-182/v1', ['Public Health & Epidemiology', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'Department of Preventive Health, Koya Technical Institute, Kurdistan Ministry of Higher Education, Erbil, Kurdistan Region, 44023, Iraq', u'Bangubandhu Fellowship on Science and ICT Trust, Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh, Dhaka, Bangladesh']]
[u'\xadA curated transcriptomic dataset collection relevant to embryonic development associated with in vitro fertilization in healthy individuals and patients with polycystic ovary syndrome', ['Rafah Mackeh', 'Sabri Boughorbel', 'Damien Chaussabel', 'Tomoshige Kino'], u'23 Feb 2017', u'The collection of large-scale datasets available in public repositories is rapidly growing and providing opportunities to identify and fill gaps in different fields of biomedical research. However, users of these datasets should be able to selectively browse datasets related to their field of interest. Here we made available a collection of transcriptome datasets related to human follicular cells from normal individuals or patients with polycystic ovary syndrome, in the process of their development, during in vitro fertilization. After RNA-seq dataset exclusion and careful selection based on study description and sample information, 12 datasets, encompassing a total of 85 unique transcriptome profiles, were identified in NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus and uploaded to the Gene Expression Browser (GXB), a web application specifically designed for interactive query and visualization of integrated large-scale data. Once annotated in GXB, multiple sample grouping has been made in order to create rank lists to allow easy data interpretation and comparison. The GXB tool also allows the users to browse a single gene across multiple projects to evaluate its expression profiles in multiple biological systems/conditions in a web-based customized graphical views.
