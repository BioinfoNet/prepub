[u'Ability of device to collect bacteria from cough aerosols generated by adults with cystic fibrosis', ['David N. Ku', 'Sarah K. Ku', 'Beth Helfman', 'Nael A. McCarty', 'Bernard J. Wolff', 'Jonas M. Winchell', 'Larry J. Anderson'], u'05 Aug 2016', u'Background: Identifying lung pathogens and acute spikes in lung counts remain a challenge in the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Bacteria from the deep lung may be sampled from aerosols produced during coughing.\nMethods: A new device was used to collect and measure bacteria levels from cough aerosols of patients with CF. Sputum and oral specimens were also collected and measured for comparison. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Streptococcus mitis were detected in specimens using Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) molecular assays.\nResults: Twenty adult patients with CF and 10 healthy controls participated. CF related bacteria (CFRB) were detected in 13/20 (65%) cough specimens versus 15/15 (100%) sputum specimens. Commensal S. mitis was present in 0/17 (0%, p=0.0002) cough specimens and 13/14 (93%) sputum samples. In normal controls, no bacteria were collected in cough specimens but 4/10 (40%) oral specimens were positive for CFRB.\nConclusions: Non-invasive cough aerosol collection may detect lower respiratory pathogens in CF patients, with similar specificity and sensitivity to rates detected by BAL, without contamination by oral CFRB or commensal bacteria.', u'/articles/5-1920/v1', ['Public Health & Epidemiology', 'Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases'], [u'Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, 30332, USA', u'MD Innovate, Inc, Decatur, GA, 30030, USA', u'Emory Children\u2019s Center for Cystic Fibrosis Research, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, 30322, USA', u'Department of Pediatrics, Emory University, Atlanta, 30322, USA', u'Respiratory Diseases Branch, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, 30333, USA', u'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, Emory University and Children\u2019s Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, GA, 30322, USA']]
[u'Predicted protein interactions of IFITMs\xa0which inhibit Zika virus infection', ['Madhavi K. Ganapathiraju'], u'05 Aug 2016', u'After the first reported case of Zika virus in Brazil, in 2015, a significant increase in the reported cases of microcephaly was observed. Microcephaly is a neurological condition in which the infant\u2019s head is significantly smaller with complications in brain development. Recently, two small membrane-associated interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins (IFITM1 and IFITM3) have been shown to repress members of the flaviviridae family which includes the Zika virus. However, the exact mechanisms leading to the inhibition of the virus are yet unknown. Here, we assembled an interactome of IFITM1 and IFITM3 with known protein-protein interactions (PPIs) collected from publicly available databases and novel PPIs predicted using High-confidence Protein-Protein Interaction Prediction (HiPPIP) model. We analyzed the functional and pathway associations of the interacting proteins, and found that there are several immunity pathways (interferon signaling, cd28 signaling in T-helper cells crosstalk between dendritic cells and natural killer cells), neuronal pathways (axonal guidance signaling, neural tube closure and actin cytoskeleton signaling) and developmental pathways that are associated with these interactors. These results could help direct future research in elucidating the mechanisms underlying the viral immunity to Zika virus and other flaviviruses.', u'/articles/5-1919/v1', ['Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases'], [u'Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, USA']]
[u'Neurosteroids are reduced in diabetic neuropathy and may be associated with the development of neuropathic pain', ['Stephen R. Humble'], u'05 Aug 2016', u'Introduction: Peripheral and central sensitisation are implicated in the development of neuropathic pain. Hypersensitivity of pain pathway neurons has been described in animal models of diabetic neuropathy, which is postulated to be related to an imbalance between inhibitory and excitatory signals within the spinal cord. GABAergic neurons within the pain pathway are vital for the transmission of painful stimuli to higher centres. A developmental change in the rate of exponential decay of GABAergic synaptic events has been observed in other types of neurons and this may be associated with fluctuations in endogenous neurosteroid tone.\xa0\r\n\xa0\r\nMethods: The whole-cell patch-clamp technique was used on slices of neural tissue. Electrophysiological recordings were obtained from wild type mice between the ages of 6 and 80 days in the spinal cord, the nucleus reticularis of the thalamus and the cerebral cortex. Recordings were also obtained from mice with diabetic neuropathy (ob/ob and db/db) between the ages of 60 and 80 days. Behavioural experiments were performed to examine mechanical and thermal nociception.\r\n\xa0\r\nResults: Electrophysiological recordings from cortical pain pathway neurons from mature type-2 diabetic mice revealed that the endogenous neurosteroid tone is reduced compared to control. However, selected neurosteroid compounds had a more pronounced effect on the GABAA receptors of these diabetic mice. ob/ob mice exhibit mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia, which was reduced by neurosteroids applied exogenously.\r\n\xa0\r\nConclusions: The reduced endogenous neurosteroid tone in ob/ob mice may be linked to their hypersensitivity. Neurosteroids may exert analgesic effects in pathological pain states by attempting to restore the physiological GABAergic inhibitory tone.', u'/articles/5-1923/v1', ['Development & Evolution', 'Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry'], [u'Department of Anaesthetics and Pain Management, Charing Cross Hospital, Imperial College NHS Healthcare Trust London, London, W6 8RF, UK']]
[u'Synthesis, characterization and toxicity studies of pyridinecarboxaldehydes and L-tryptophan derived Schiff bases and corresponding copper (II) complexes', ['Margarita Malakyan', 'Nelly Babayan', 'Ruzanna Grigoryan', 'Natalya Sarkisyan', 'Vahan Tonoyan', 'Davit Tadevosyan', 'Vladimir Matosyan', 'Rouben Aroutiounian', 'Arsen Arakelyan'], u'05 Aug 2016', u'Schiff bases and their metal-complexes are versatile compounds exhibiting a broad range of biological activities and thus actively used in the drug development process. The aim of the present study was the synthesis and characterization of new Schiff bases and their copper (II) complexes, derived from L-tryptophan and isomeric (2-; 3-; 4-) pyridinecarboxaldehydes, as well as the assessment of their toxicity in vitro. The optimal conditions of the Schiff base synthesis resulting in up to 75-85% yield of target products were identified. The structure-activity relationship analysis indicated that the location of the carboxaldehyde group at 2-, 3- or 4-position with regard to nitrogen of the pyridine ring in aldehyde component of the L-tryptophan derivative Schiff bases and corresponding copper complexes essentially change the biological activity of the compounds. The carboxaldehyde group at 2- and 4-positions leads to the higher cytotoxic activity, than that of at 3-position, and the presence of the copper in the complexes increases the cytotoxicity. Based on toxicity classification data, the compounds with non-toxic profile were identified, which can be used as new entities in the drug development process using Schiff base scaffold.', u'/articles/5-1921/v1', ['Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'Scientific Centre of Radiation Medicine and Burns, Ministry of Health, Yerevan, 0054, Armenia', u'Institute of Molecular Biology, National Academy of Sciences, Yerevan, 0014, Armenia', u'Yerevan State University, Ministry of Education and Science, Yerevan, 0025, Armenia']]
