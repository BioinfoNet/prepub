[u'Does sadness impair color perception? Flawed evidence and faulty methods', ['Alex O. Holcombe', 'Nicholas J. L.  Brown', 'Patrick T. Goodbourn', 'Alexander Etz', 'Sebastian Geukes'], u'21 Jul 2016', u'In their 2015 paper, Thorstenson, Pazda, and Elliot offered evidence from two experiments that perception of colors on the blue\u2013yellow axis was impaired if the participants had watched a sad movie clip, compared to participants who watched clips designed to induce a happy or neutral mood. Subsequently, these authors retracted their article, citing a mistake in their statistical analyses and a problem with the data in one of their experiments. Here, we discuss a number of other methodological problems with Thorstenson et al.\u2019s experimental design, and also demonstrate that the problems with the data go beyond what these authors reported. We conclude that repeating one of the two experiments, with the minor revisions proposed by Thorstenson et al., will not be sufficient to address the problems with this work.', u'/articles/5-1778/v1', ['Public Health & Epidemiology', 'Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry'], [u'School of Psychology, University of Sydney, New South Wales, 2006, Australia', u'Department of Health Sciences, University Medical Center, University of Groningen, Groningen, 9713 GZ, Netherlands', u'School of Psychological Sciences, University of Melbourne, Victoria, 3010, Australia', u'Department of Cognitive Sciences, University of California, Irvine, CA, 92697-5100, USA', u'Institut f\xfcr Psychologie, Westf\xe4lische Wilhelms-Universit\xe4t M\xfcnster, M\xfcnster, 48149, Germany']]
