The findings from one specific organization (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer; EORTC) are compared with the actual publication history of the trials in question.

[u'Molecular dynamic simulations of glycine amino acid association with potassium and sodium ions in explicit solvent', ['Ivan Terterov', 'Sergei Koniakhin', 'Sergey Vyazmin', 'Vitali Boitsov', 'Michael Dubina'], u'24 Jan 2017', u'Salt solutions are the natural environment in which biological molecules act, and dissolved ions are actively involved in biochemical processes. With metal ions, the membrane potentials are maintained. Ions are crucial for the activity of many enzymes, and their ability to coordinate with chemical groups modulates protein-protein interactions. Here we present a comparative study of sodium and potassium coordination with zwitterionic glycine, by means of explicit solvent molecular dynamics. We demonstrated that contact ion pair of cations and carboxylate group splits into two distinct coordination states. Sodium binding is significantly stronger than for potassium. These results can shed light on the different roles of sodium and potassium ions in abiogenic peptide synthesis.', u'/articles/6-74/v1', ['Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'St. Petersburg Academic University, St. Petersburg, Russian Federation', u'Ioffe Physical-Technical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, St. Petersburg, Russian Federation', u'Saint Petersburg Scientific Center RAS, St. Petersburg, Russian Federation']]
[u'Factors associated with preterm delivery and low birth weight: a study from rural Maharashtra, India', ['Anand Ahankari', 'Sharda Bapat', 'Puja Myles', 'Andrew Fogarty', 'Laila Tata'], u'24 Jan 2017', u'Background \r\nAlthough preterm delivery and low birth weight (LBW) have been studied in India, findings may not be generalisable to rural areas such as the Marathwada region of Maharashtra state. There is limited information available on maternal and child health indicators from this region. We aimed to present some local estimates of preterm delivery and LBW in the Osmanabad district of Marathwada and assess available maternal risk factors.\r\n\xa0\nMethods\r\nThe study used routinely collected data on all in-hospital births in the maternity department of Halo Medical Foundation\u2019s hospital from 1st January 2008 to 31st December 2014. Multivariable logistic regression analysis provided odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for preterm delivery and LBW according to each maternal risk factor.\r\n\xa0\nResults\r\nWe analysed 655 live births, of which 6.1% were preterm deliveries. Of the full term births (N=615), 13.8% were LBW (<2.5 kilograms at birth). The odds of preterm delivery were three times higher (OR=3.23, 95% CI 1.36 to 7.65) and the odds of LBW were double (OR=2.03, 95% CI 1.14 to 3.60) among women <22 years of age compared with older women. The odds of both preterm delivery and LBW were reduced in multigravida compared with primigravida women regardless of age. Anaemia (Hb<11g/dl), which was prevalent in 91% of women tested, was not significantly related to these birth outcomes.\r\n\xa0\nConclusions\r\nThe odds of preterm delivery and LBW were much higher in mothers under 22 years of age in this rural Indian population. Future studies should explore other related risk factors and the reasons for poor birth outcomes in younger mothers in this population, to inform the design of appropriate public health policies that address this issue.', u'/articles/6-72/v1', ['Urology, Gynecology & Obstetrics'], [u'Division of Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK', u'Halo Medical Foundation, Maharashtra, India']]
