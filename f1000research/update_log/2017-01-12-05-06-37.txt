[u'Case Report: Severe hypernatremia from psychogenic adipsia', ['Sarah Manning', 'Rehan Shaffie', 'Shitij Arora'], u'11 Jan 2017', u'Hypernatremia is a common emergency room presentation and carries high mortality. We describe a case of a 56-year-old male patient with who presents with refusal to drink water for several weeks leading to the admission.

[u'A\xa0voltage-dependent fluorescent indicator for optogenetic applications, archaerhodopsin-3: Structure and optical properties from in silico modeling', ['Dmitrii M. Nikolaev', 'Anton Emelyanov', 'Vitaly M. Boitsov', 'Maxim S Panov', 'Mikhail N. Ryazantsev'], u'11 Jan 2017', u'It was demonstrated in recent studies that some rhodopsins can be used in optogenetics as fluorescent indicators of membrane voltage. One of the promising candidates for these applications is archaerhodopsin-3. However, the fluorescent signal for wild-type achaerhodopsin-3 is not strong enough for real applications. Rational design of mutants with an improved signal is an important task, which requires both experimental and theoretical studies. Herein, we used a homology-based computational approach to predict the three-dimensional structure of archaerhodopsin-3, and a Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics (QM/MM) hybrid approach with high-level multireference ab initio methodology (SORCI+Q/AMBER) to model optical properties of this protein. We demonstrated that this methodology allows for reliable prediction of structure and spectral properties of archaerhodopsin-3. The results of this study can be utilized for computational molecular design of efficient fluorescent indicators of membrane voltage for modern optogenetics on the basis of archaerhodopsin-3.', u'/articles/6-33/v1', ['Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'Saint-Petersburg National Research Academic University of the Russian Academy of Science, St. Petersburg, Russian Federation', u'Saint-Petersburg State University, St. Petersburg, Russian Federation', u'SPbSC RAS, Saint-Petersburg State University, St. Petersburg, Russian Federation']]
