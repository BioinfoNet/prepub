Tedds'], u'02 Aug 2016', u'With biomedical research becoming ever more computationally intensive, the challenge is to find sophisticated software tools that can keep pace with new requirements, while still being easy to use and secure. We describe a technical implementation of an infrastructure to manage the full research ecosystem from participant management, to data and sample collection, and finally to data storage, interrogation and analysis. This infrastructure, known as the Biomedical Research Infrastructure Software as a Service Kit (BRISSKit http://www.brisskit.le.ac.uk), is built on open source solutions throughout, and demonstrates that it is possible for a biomedical research platform to be supplied as a service.', u'/articles/5-1905/v1', ['Public Health & Epidemiology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'Data to Knowledge, School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol, Bristol, BS8 2BN, UK', u'Department of Health Sciences, Centre for Medicine, University of Leicester, Leicester, LE1 7RH, UK', u'National Institute for Health Research Leicester Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit, Glenfield Hospital, Leicester, LE3 9QP, UK', u'National Institute for Health Research Leicester Respiratory Biomedical Research Unit, Glenfield Hospital, Leicester, LE3 9QP, UK', u'Department of Genetics, University of Leicester, Leicester, LE1 7RH, UK']]
[u'Personal values influencing career path in academic medicine', ['Marissa Tsoi', 'Braden D. Teitge', 'Christopher R. Madan', 'Louis H. Francescutti'], u'02 Aug 2016', u'To pursue research, education, and health policy in one\u2019s career, broadly defined as academic medicine, is one of the most important decisions of a trainee doctor\u2019s career. Despite this, there is scant literature on which factors influence trainees\u2019 choices towards clinical work or academic research. As the MD/PhD is a relatively young training path compared to the traditional PhD (Doctor of Philosophy) and MD (Doctor of Medicine) programs, it prompts the question: at the crossroads of a career, what sways the individual to select an MD, PhD, or MD/PhD program? This is a valuable question to be answered for trainees who are considering multiple career paths, for educators who want to guide undifferentiated students, and for policy makers who develop and coordinate research programs. \u201cIntellectual stimulation\u201d is the most consistently identified personal value which draws trainees to academic medicine. Mentorship is linked strongly to success in the field. Conversely, long training periods, a lack of autonomy, and financial considerations are deterrents from a career in academic medicine. Insight into the decision-making process is provided by recent trainees in these respective fields, as well as experienced academic clinicians.', u'/articles/5-1903/v1', ['Publishing, Education & Communication'], [u'Department of Family & Community Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada', u'Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada', u'Department of Psychology, Boston College, Boston, USA', u'School of Public Health, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada']]
[u'Syphilis may be a confounding factor, not a causative agent, in syphilitic ALS', ['Bert Tuk'], u'02 Aug 2016', u'Based upon a review of published clinical observations regarding syphilitic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), I hypothesize that syphilis is actually a confounding factor, not a causative factor, in syphilitic ALS. Moreover, I propose that the successful treatment of ALS symptoms in patients with syphilitic ALS using penicillin G and hydrocortisone is an indirect consequence of the treatment regimen and is not due to the treatment of syphilis. Specifically, I propose that the observed effect is due to the various pharmacological activities of penicillin G (e.g., a GABA receptor antagonist) and/or the multifaceted pharmacological activity of hydrocortisone. The notion that syphilis may be a confounding factor in syphilitic ALS is highly relevant, as it suggests that treating ALS patients with penicillin G and hydrocortisone\u2014regardless of whether they present with syphilitic ALS or non-syphilitic ALS\u2014may be effective at treating this rapidly progressive, highly devastating disease.', u'/articles/5-1904/v1', ['Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases', 'Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry', 'Urology, Gynecology & Obstetrics'], [u'Leiden Academic Center for Drug Research (LACDR), Leiden University, Leiden, 2333 CC, Netherlands', u'Ry Pharma, Hofstraat 1, Willemstad, 4797 AC, Netherlands']]
