[u'Case Report: Whole exome sequencing identifies a novel frameshift insertion c.1325dupT (p.F442fsX2) in the tyrosine kinase domain of BTK gene in a young Indian individual with X-linked agammaglobulinemia', ['Amit Rawat', 'Shamsudheen Karuthedath Vellarikkal', 'Ankit Verma', 'Rijith Jayarajan', 'Anju Gupta', 'Surjit Singh', 'Anita Chopra', 'Rajive Kumar', 'Vinod Scaria', 'Sridhar Sivasubbu'], u'14 Nov 2016', u"X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is an extremely rare inherited primary immunodeficiency characterized by recurrent bacterial infections, decrease in number of mature B cells and low serum immunoglobulins. XLA is caused by mutations in the gene encoding Bruton's tyrosine kinase. We report a case of a young Indian boy suspected to have XLA. Immunophenotyping was performed for the affected child using CD20, CD19 and CD3 antibodies. Whole exome sequencing was performed using trio-based approach. The variants were further analyzed using capillary sequencing in the trio as well as maternal grandmother. Initial immunophenotyping in the affected child showed decreased count of CD19+ B cells. To strengthen the clinical findings and confirm the diagnosis of XLA, we performed whole exome sequencing. Our analysis identified a novel frameshift insertion (c.1325dupT) in the BTK gene, which was further validated by Sanger sequencing. Our approach shows the potential in using whole exome sequencing to pinpoint the molecular lesion, enabling timely diagnosis and genetic counseling, and potentially offering prenatal genetic testing for the family.", u'/articles/5-2667/v1', ['Public Health & Epidemiology', 'Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'Advanced Pediatrics Centre, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, 160012, India', u'Genomics and Molecular Medicine Unit, CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, New Delhi, 110025, India', u'Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, New Delhi, 110025, India', u'Lab oncology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, 110029, India', u'GN Ramachandran Knowledge Center for Genome Informatics, CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, New Delhi, 110025, India']]
