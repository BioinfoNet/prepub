[u'Design of chemical space networks incorporating compound distance relationships', ['Antonio de la Vega de Leon', 'Jurgen Bajorath'], u'04 Nov 2016', u'Networks, in which nodes represent compounds and edges pairwise similarity relationships, are used as coordinate-free representations of chemical space. So-called chemical space networks (CSNs) provide intuitive access to structural relationships within compound data sets and can be annotated with activity information. However, in such similarity-based networks, distances between compounds are typically determined for layout purposes and clarity and have no chemical meaning. By contrast, inter-compound distances as a measure of dissimilarity can be directly obtained from coordinate-based representations of chemical space. Herein, we introduce a CSN variant that incorporates compound distance relationships and thus further increases the information content of compound networks. The design was facilitated by adapting the Kamada-Kawai algorithm. Kamada-Kawai networks are the first CSNs that are based on numerical similarity measures, but do not depend on chosen similarity threshold values.', u'/articles/5-2634/v1', ['Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'Department of Life Science Informatics, Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit\xe4t, Bonn, Germany']]
