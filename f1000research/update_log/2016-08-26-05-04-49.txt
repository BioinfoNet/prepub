[u'Invariant death', ['Steven A. Frank'], u'25 Aug 2016', u'In nematodes, environmental or physiological perturbations alter death\u2019s scaling\xa0of time. In human cancer, genetic perturbations alter death\u2019s curvature of time.\xa0Those changes in scale and curvature follow the constraining contours of death\u2019s\xa0invariant geometry. I show that the constraints arise from a fundamental extension\xa0to the theories of randomness, invariance and scale. A generalized Gompertz law\xa0follows. The constraints imposed by the invariant Gompertz geometry explain the\xa0tendency of perturbations to stretch or bend death\u2019s scaling of time.

[u'The invariances of power law size distributions', ['Steven A. Frank'], u'25 Aug 2016', u'Size varies. Small things are typically more frequent than large things. The logarithm\xa0of frequency often declines linearly with the logarithm of size. That power law relation\xa0forms one of the common patterns of nature. Why does the complexity of nature reduce\xa0to such a simple pattern? Why do things as different as tree size and enzyme\xa0rate follow similarly simple patterns? Here I analyze such patterns by their invariant\xa0properties. For example, a common pattern should not change when adding a constant\xa0value to all observations. That shift is essentially the renumbering of the points\xa0on a ruler without changing the metric information provided by the ruler. A ruler is\xa0shift invariant only when its scale is properly calibrated to the pattern being measured.\xa0Stretch invariance corresponds to the conservation of the total amount of something,\xa0such as the total biomass and consequently the average size. Rotational invariance\xa0corresponds to pattern that does not depend on the order in which underlying processes\xa0occur, for example, a scale that additively combines the component processes\xa0leading to observed values. I use tree size as an example to illustrate how the key\xa0invariances shape pattern. A simple interpretation of common pattern follows. That\xa0simple interpretation connects the normal distribution to a wide variety of other common\xa0patterns through the transformations of scale set by the fundamental invariances.', u'/articles/5-2074/v1', ['Public Health & Epidemiology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of California, Irvine, CA, 92697\u20132525, USA']]
