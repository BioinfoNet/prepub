[u'Grand challenges for global brain sciences', [], u'19 Dec 2016', u'The next grand challenges for science and society are in the brain sciences.\xa0 A collection of 60+ scientists from around the world, together with 15+ observers from national, private, and foundations, spent two days together discussing the top challenges that we could solve as a global community in the next decade.\xa0 We settled on three challenges, spanning anatomy, physiology, and medicine.\xa0 Addressing all three challenges requires novel computational infrastructure.\xa0 The group proposed the advent of The International Brain Station (TIBS), to address these challenges, and launch brain sciences to the next level of understanding.', u'/articles/5-2873/v1', ['Development & Evolution', 'Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry'], [u'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Institute for Computational Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, USA', u'Center for Imaging Science, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, USA', u'Department of Computer Science, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, USA', u'Institute for Data Intensive Engineering and Sciences, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, USA', u'Kavli Neuroscience Discovery Institute, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, USA']]
