[u'RNA-seq assembler artifacts can bias expression counts and differential expression analysis - application of YeATS on the chickpea transcriptome', ['Sandeep Chakraborty'], u'27 Sep 2016', u'Background: The unprecedented volume of genomic and transcriptomic\xa0data analyzed by software pipelines makes verification of inferences based on such\xa0data, albeit theoretically possible, a challenging proposition. The availability of intermediate\xa0data can immensely aid re-validation efforts. One such example is the\xa0transcriptome, assembled from raw RNA-seq reads, which is frequently used for\xa0annotation and quantification of genes transcribed. The quality of the assembled\xa0transcripts influences the accuracy of inferences based on them.\nMethod: Here\xa0the publicly available transcriptome from Cicer arietinum (ICC4958; Desi chickpea,\xa0http://www.nipgr.res.in/ctdb.html) was analyzed using YeATS.\nResults\xa0and Conclusion: The analysis revealed that a majority of the highly expressed transcripts\xa0(HET) encoded multiple genes, strongly indicating that the counts may have\xa0been biased by the merging of different transcripts. TC00004 is ranked in the top\xa0five HET for all five tissues analyzed here, and encodes both a retinoblastoma-binding-like protein (E-value=0) and a senescence-associated protein (E-value=\xa05e-108). Fragmented transcripts are another source of error. The ribulose bisphosphate\xa0carboxylase small chain (RBCSC) protein is split into two transcripts with an\xa0overlapping amino acid sequence \u201dASNGGRVHC\u201d, TC13991 and TC23009, with\xa0length 201 and 332 nucleotides and expression counts 17.90 and 1403.8, respectively.\r\nThe huge difference in counts indicates an erroneous normalization algorithm\xa0in determining counts. It is well known that RBCSC is highly expressed and expectedly\xa0TC23009 ranks fifth among HETs in the shoot. Furthermore, some transcripts\xa0are split into open reading frames that map to the same protein, although this should\xa0not have any significant bearing on the counts. It is proposed that studies analyzing\xa0differential expression based on the transcriptome should consider these artifacts,\xa0and providing intermediate assembled transcriptomes should be mandatory, possibly\xa0with a link to the raw sequence data (Bioproject).', u'/articles/5-2394/v1', ['Publishing, Education & Communication', 'Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'Celia Engineers, T.
