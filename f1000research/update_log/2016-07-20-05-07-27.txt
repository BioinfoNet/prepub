Wiencko', 'Manuel Bernal-Llinares', 'Kenneth Bryan', 'David J. Lynn'], u'19 Jul 2016', u'Highly connected nodes (hubs) in biological networks are topologically important to the structure of the network and have also been shown to be preferentially associated with a range of phenotypes of interest. The relative importance of a hub node, however, can change depending on the biological context. Here, we report a Cytoscape app, the Contextual Hub Analysis Tool (CHAT), which enables users to easily construct and visualize a network of interactions from a gene list of interest, integrate contextual information, such as gene expression data, and identify hub nodes that are more highly connected to contextual nodes (e.g. genes that are differentially expressed) than expected by chance. In a case study, we use CHAT to construct a network of genes that are differentially expressed in Dengue fever, a viral infection. CHAT was used to identify and compare contextual and degree-based hubs in this network. The top 20 degree-based hubs were enriched in pathways related to the cell cycle and cancer, which is likely due to the fact that proteins involved in these processes tend to be highly connected in general. In comparison, the top 20 contextual hubs were enriched in pathways commonly observed in a viral infection including pathways related to the immune response to viral infection. This analysis shows that such contextual hubs are considerably more biologically relevant than degree-based hubs and that analyses which rely on the identification of hubs solely based on their connectivity may be biased towards nodes that are highly connected in general rather than in the specific context of interest.\r\n\xa0\r\nAvailability: CHAT is available for Cytoscape 3.0+ and can be installed via the Cytoscape App Store (http://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/chat).', u'/articles/5-1745/v1', ['Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'EMBL Australia Biomedical Informatics Group, Infection & Immunity Theme, South Australian Medical and Health Research Institute, Adelaide, Australia', u'Animal and Bioscience Research Department, Animal and Grassland Research and Innovation Centre, Teagasc, Meath, Ireland', u'School of Medicine, Flinders University, Bedford Park, Australia']]
[u'Effect of gestational diabetes mellitus on maternal thyroid function and body mass index', ['Elrazi A. Ali', 'Hala Abdullahi', 'Duria A. Rayis', 'Ishag Adam', 'Mohamed F. Lutfi'], u'19 Jul 2016', u'Background: The exact influences of thyroid functions on body mass index (BMI) are ill-defined in euthyroid pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).\nObjectives: To investigate the effect of GDM on maternal thyroid functions and BMI.\nMethods: \xa0A case- control study was conducted in Saad Abualila Hospital, Khartoum, Sudan June to August 2015. Cases included women with GDM and healthy pregnant women as controls. Thyroid hormones [thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free tri-iodothyronine (FT3), and free thyroxine (FT4)] and anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) and anti-thyroglobulin (anti-TG) antibodies were measured.\nResults: \xa0BMI was significantly increased in GDM patients (26.3 (2.7) Kg/m2) compared with the control group (24.3(1.8) Kg/m2, P = 0.001). Levels of FT3 and FT4 were significantly decreased in GDM patients (0.632 (0.408 \u2500 1.074) pg/ml; 0.672 (0.614 \u2500 0.960) ng/dl) compared with the healthy pregnant women (0.820 (0.510\u25001.385) pg/ml, P = 0.021; 0.840 (0.767\u25001.200) ng/dl, P < 0.001). In contrast, anti-TPO and anti-TG were significantly higher in GDM patients (11.13 (7.969 \u250013.090) IU/ml; 14.40 (10.91\u250020.69) IU/ml) compared with the control group (8.90 (6.375\u250010.48 IU/ml, P = 0.022; 10.50 (8.2\u250013.95) IU/ml, P = 0.010). BMI correlated negatively with FT3 (r = \u2500 0. 375, P = 0.002) and FT4 (r = \u2500 0. 316, P = 0.009) and positively with anti-TPO (r = 0.361, P = 0.002) and anti-TG (r = 0.393, P = 0.010).\nConclusion: The present results add further evidence for decreased free thyroid hormones, increased anti-thyroid autoantibodies and higher BMI in patients with GDM compared to healthy pregnant women. BMI correlated directly with FT3 and FT4, but failed to demonstrate significant association with TSH.', u'/articles/5-1746/v1', ['Endocrinology & Gastroenterology'], [u'Faculty of Medicine, University of Khartoum, Khartoum, Sudan', u'Faculty of Medicine, Elneelen University, Khartoum, Sudan']]
