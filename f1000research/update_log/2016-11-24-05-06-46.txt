[u'BgeeDB, an R package for retrieval of curated expression datasets and for gene list expression localization enrichment tests', ['Andrea Komljenovic', 'Julien Roux', 'Marc Robinson-Rechavi', 'Frederic B. Bastian'], u'23 Nov 2016', u'BgeeDB is a collection of functions to import into R re-annotated, quality-controlled and reprocessed expression data available in the Bgee database. This includes data from thousands of wild-type healthy samples of multiple animal species, generated with different gene expression technologies (RNA-seq, Affymetrix microarrays, expressed sequence tags, and in situ hybridizations). BgeeDB facilitates downstream analyses, such as gene expression analyses with other Bioconductor packages. Moreover, BgeeDB includes a new gene set enrichment test for preferred localization of expression of genes in anatomical structures (\u201cTopAnat\u201d). Along with the classical Gene Ontology enrichment test, this test provides a complementary way to interpret gene lists.\nAvailability: http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/BgeeDB/', u'/articles/5-2748/v1', ['Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'Department of Ecology and Evolution, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland', u'SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Lausanne, Switzerland']]
