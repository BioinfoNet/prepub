[u'Electronic medical records in humanitarian emergencies \u2013 the development of an Ebola clinical information and patient management system', ['Kiran Jobanputra', 'Jane Greig', 'Ganesh Shankar', 'Eric Perakslis', 'Ronald Kremer', 'Jay Achar', 'Ivan Gayton'], u'23 Jun 2016', u'By November 2015, the West Africa Ebola epidemic had caused 28598 infections and 11299 deaths in the three countries most affected. The outbreak required rapid innovation and adaptation. M\xe9decins sans Fronti\xe8res (MSF) scaled up its usual 20-30 bed Ebola management centres (EMCs) to 100-300 beds with over 300 workers in some settings. This brought challenges in patient and clinical data management resulting from the difficulties of working safely with high numbers of Ebola patients. We describe a project MSF established with software developers and the Google Social Impact Team to develop context-adapted tools to address the challenges of recording Ebola clinical information. We share the outcomes and key lessons learned in innovating rapidly under pressure in difficult environmental conditions. Information on adoption, maintenance, and data quality was gathered through review of project documentation, discussions with field staff and key project stakeholders, and analysis of tablet data. In March 2015, a full prototype was deployed in Magburaka EMC, Sierra Leone. Inpatient data were captured on 204 clinical interactions with 34 patients from 5 March until 10 April 2015. 85 record \u201cpairs\u201d for 32 patients with 26 data items (temperature and symptoms) per pair were analysed. The average agreement between sources was 85%, ranging from 69% to 95% for individual variables. The time taken to deliver the product was more than that anticipated by MSF (7 months versus 6 weeks). Deployment of the tablet coincided with a dramatic drop in patient numbers and thus had little impact on patient care. We have identified lessons specific to humanitarian-technology collaborative projects and propose a framework for emergency humanitarian innovation. Time and effort is required to bridge differences in organisational culture between the technology and humanitarian worlds. This investment is essential for establishing a shared vision on deliverables, urgency, and ownership of product.', u'/articles/5-1477/v1', ['Public Health & Epidemiology', 'Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases', 'Critical Care & Emergency Medicine'], [u'Manson Unit, M\xe9decins sans Fronti\xe8res (MSF), London, UK', u'Google Crisis Response Team, Mountain View, CA, USA', u'Centre for Biomedical Informatics and Department of Global Health and Social Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Harvard University, Boston, MA, USA', u'MSF, Amsterdam, Netherlands']]
[u'Recent advances in understanding transcription termination by RNA polymerase II', ['Travis J. Loya', 'Daniel Reines'], u'23 Jun 2016', u'Transcription termination is a fundamental process in which RNA polymerase ceases RNA chain extension and dissociates from the chromatin template, thereby defining the end of the transcription unit. Our understanding of the biological role and functional importance of termination by RNA polymerase II and the range of processes in which it is involved has grown significantly in recent years. A large set of nucleic acid-binding proteins and enzymes have been identified as part of the termination machinery. A greater appreciation for the coupling of termination to RNA processing and metabolism has been recognized. In addition to serving as an essential step at the end of the transcription cycle, termination is involved in the regulation of a broad range of cellular processes. More recently, a role for termination in pervasive transcription, non-coding RNA regulation, genetic stability, chromatin remodeling, the immune response, and disease has come to the fore. Interesting mechanistic questions remain, but the last several years have resulted in significant insights into termination and an increasing recognition of its biological importance.', u'/articles/5-1478/v1', ['Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases', 'Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'Department of Biochemistry, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, 30322, USA']]
[u'SNPsplit: Allele-specific splitting of alignments between genomes with known SNP genotypes', ['Felix Krueger', 'Simon R. Andrews'], u'23 Jun 2016', u'Sequencing reads overlapping polymorphic sites in diploid mammalian genomes may be\xa0assigned to one allele or the other. This holds the potential to detect gene expression,\xa0chromatin modifications, DNA methylation or nuclear interactions in an allele-specific fashion.\xa0SNPsplit is an allele-specific alignment sorter designed to read files in SAM/BAM format\xa0and determine the allelic origin of reads or read-pairs that cover known single nucleotide\xa0polymorphic (SNP) positions. For this to work libraries must have been aligned to a genome\xa0in which all known SNP positions were masked with the ambiguity base \u2019N\u2019 and aligned using\xa0a suitable mapping program such as Bowtie2, TopHat, STAR, HISAT2, HiCUP or Bismark.\r\nSNPsplit also provides an automated solution to generate N-masked reference genomes for\xa0hybrid mouse strains based on the variant call information provided by the Mouse Genomes\xa0Project. The unique ability of SNPsplit to work with various different kinds of sequencing data\xa0including RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, Bisulfite-Seq or Hi-C opens new avenues for the integrative\xa0exploration of allele-specific data.', u'/articles/5-1479/v1', ['Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'Bioinformatics Group, The Babraham Institute, Cambridge, UK']]
