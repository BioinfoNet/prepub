[u'A pilot study: Can heart rate variability (HRV) be determined using short-term photoplethysmograms?', ['Mohamed Elgendi', 'Ian Norton', 'Matt Brearley', 'Socrates Dokos', 'Derek Abbott', 'Dale Schuurmans'], u'22 Sep 2016', u'To date, there have been no studies that investigate the independent use of the photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal to determine heart rate variability (HRV). However, researchers have demonstrated that PPG signals offer an alternative way of measuring HRV when electrocardiogram (ECG) and PPG signals are collected simultaneously. Based on these findings, we take the use of PPGs to the next step and investigate a different approach to show the potential independent use of short 20-second PPG signals collected from healthy subjects after exercise in a hot environment to measure HRV. Our hypothesis is that if the PPG--HRV indices are negatively correlated with age, then short PPG signals are appropriate measurements for extracting HRV parameters. The PPGs of 27 healthy male volunteers at rest and after exercise were used to determine the HRV indices: standard deviation of heartbeat interval (SDNN) and the root-mean square of the difference of successive heartbeats (RMSSD). The results indicate that the use of the $aa$ interval, derived from the acceleration of PPG signals, is promising in determining the HRV statistical indices SDNN and RMSSD over 20-second PPG recordings. Moreover, the post-exercise SDNN index shows a negative correlation with age. There tends to be a decrease of the PPG--SDNN index with increasing age, whether at rest or after exercise. This new outcome validates the negative relationship between HRV in general with age, and consequently provides another evidence that short PPG signals have the potential to be used in heart rate analysis without the need to measure lengthy sequences of either ECG or PPG signals.', u'/articles/5-2354/v1', ['Cardiopulmonary & Vascular Disorders', 'Public Health & Epidemiology'], [u'Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada', u'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada', u'Department of Computing Science, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada', u'National Critical Care and Trauma Response Centre, Darwin, Australia', u'Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia', u'School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia']]

Baker', 'Adam J. Ratner', 'Kirsty Le Doare', 'Stephanie J. Schrag'], u'22 Sep 2016', u'Globally, group B Streptococcus (GBS) remains the leading cause of sepsis and meningitis in young infants, with its greatest burden in the first 90 days of life. Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) for women at risk of transmitting GBS to their newborns has been effective in reducing, but not eliminating, the young infant GBS disease burden in many high income countries. However, identification of women at risk and administration of IAP is very difficult in many low and middle income country (LMIC) settings, and is not possible for home deliveries. Immunization of pregnant women with a GBS vaccine represents an alternate pathway to protecting newborns from GBS disease, through the transplacental antibody transfer to the fetus in utero. This approach to prevent GBS disease in young infants is currently under development, and is approaching late stage clinical evaluation.\r\nThis manuscript includes a review of the natural history of the disease, global disease burden estimates, diagnosis and existing control options in different settings, the biological rationale for a vaccine including previous supportive studies, analysis of current candidates in development, possible correlates of protection and current status of immunogenicity assays. Future potential vaccine development pathways to licensure and use in LMICs, trial design and implementation options are discussed, with the objective to provide a basis for reflection, rather than recommendations.', u'/articles/5-2355/v1', ['Public Health & Epidemiology', 'Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases'], [u'National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, Division of Bacterial Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, USA', u'Epidemic Intelligence Service, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, USA', u'Initiative for Vaccine Research, World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland', u'Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, USA', u'Department of Molecular Virology and Microbiology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, USA', u"Center for Vaccine Awareness and Research, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, USA", u'Departments of Pediatrics and Microbiology, New York University School of Medicine, New York, USA', u'Centre for International Child Health, Imperial College, London, UK']]
