[u'Socio-cultural aspects of gender-based violence and its impacts on women\u2019s health in South Asia', ['Ghose Bishwajit', 'Sajeeb Sarker', 'Sanni Yaya'], u'05 May 2016', u"This review attempts to shed light on the socio-cultural roots of gender-based violence (GBV) and its impact on women's health with a special reference to reproductive health in the context of South Asia. It also identifies the policy and capacity gaps that impede the implementation of gender-related development goals and makes recommendations in light of the ongoing situation. \xa0Led by the growing recognition of the pivotal importance of women\u2019s and child\u2019s health in national development processes, the issues surrounding gender-based violence (GBV) are being given increasing prominence in the global public health agenda. However, developing regions such as South Asia and Sub Saharan Africa are lagging far behind in this respect and failing to prioritize and implement gender-related development strategies. South Asian nations in their pursuance of gender-related goals are faced with host of infrastructure issues in financing, policy guidance, implementation and legislation terms. This study highlights the fact that GBV is essentially a socio-cultural issue which calls for developing gender-sensitive social policies and making strategic investment to promote social capital tailored especially to promote a more nuanced view of women\u2019s health and human rights.Method: Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Embase, Ovid MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Web of Science were searched for original and review articles published between January of 2000 to July of 2015. Boolean search was performed to identify suitable articles relating to GBV conducted on South Asia (Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka) by using the following search terms: \xa0South Asia, GBV, IPV (intimate partner violence), domestic violence, women\u2019s health, reproductive health, risk factors, perpetrator, sexual abuse. Reference lists were searched manually for articles relevant to this study (snowballing). One volunteer from each country included in the study helped in reviewing renowned local media reports and constitutions to gather policy information germane to GBV issues.", u'/articles/5-802/v1', ['Public Health & Epidemiology'], [u'Institute of Nutrition and Food Science, University of Dhaka, Dhaka, Bangladesh', u'School of Social Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Hubei, China', u'Department of Journalism, Communication and Media Studies, State University of Bangladesh, Dhaka, Bangladesh', u'Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada']]
[u'Current clinical immunotherapeutic approaches for head and neck cancer', ['Carolina Soto Chervin', 'Bruce Brockstein'], u'05 May 2016', u'It was estimated that 59,340 new cases of head and neck cancer would be diagnosed in the US alone in 2015 and that 12,290 deaths would be attributed to the disease. Local and regional recurrences may be treated with chemotherapy and radiation; however, metastatic head and neck cancer is fatal and is treated with chemotherapy for palliation. Recent successful treatment of a variety of solid and hematological malignancies by immunotherapeutic approaches (i.e. harnessing the body\u2019s own immune system to combat disease) has added a fourth therapeutic option for the treatment of cancer. This commentary will review the status of immunotherapies in clinical development for the specific treatment of head and neck cancer.', u'/articles/5-803/v1', ['Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases', 'Eye Disorders & ENT', 'Oncology & Hematology', 'Dermatology', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'Department of Medicine, NorthShore University HealthSystem, Evanston, Ilinois, 60201, USA', u'Department of Medicine, University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois, USA']]
