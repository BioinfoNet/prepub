[u'Building the infrastructure to make science metrics more scientific', ['Jennifer Lin', 'Fiona L. Murphy', 'Mike Taylor', 'Liz Allen'], u'21 Dec 2016', u'Research leaders, policy makers and science strategists need evidence to support decision-making around research funding investment, policy and strategy.\xa0 In recent years there has been a rapid expansion in the data sources available that shed light onto aspects of research quality, excellence, use, re-use and attention, and engagement. This is at a time when the modes and routes to share and communicate research findings and data are also changing.\xa0\r\n\xa0\r\nIn this opinion piece, we outline a series of considerations and interventions that are needed to ensure that research metric development is accompanied by appropriate scrutiny and governance, to properly support the needs of research assessors and decision-makers, while securing the confidence of the research community. Key among these are: agreed \u2018gold standards\u2019 around datasets and methodologies; full transparency around the calculation and derivation of research-related indicators; and a strategy and roadmap to take the discipline of scientific indicators and research assessment to a more robust and sustainable place.', u'/articles/5-2897/v1', ['Publishing, Education & Communication'], [u'Department of Product Development, Crossref, Oxford, UK', u'Associate Fellow, Institute for Environmental Analytics, University of Reading, Reading, UK', u'Department of Research Metrics, Digital Science, London, UK', u'Department of Strategic Initiatives, F1000, London, UK', u"Visiting Senior Research Fellow, King's College London, London, UK"]]

Subjects included 58 HIV- to HIV+ adult, first-time kidney transplant patients. The main intervention was ART regimen used after transplantation. \xa0The main outcomes assessed at one- and three-years were: patient survival, death-censored graft survival, and biopsy-proven acute rejection; we also assessed serious infections within the first six months post-transplant.\xa0Results: Patient and graft survival at three years were both 90% for the entire cohort. Patients receiving protease inhibitor (PI)-containing regimens had lower patient survival at one and three years than patients receiving PI-sparing regimens: 85% vs. 100% (p=0.06) and 82% vs. 100% (p=0.03), respectively. Patients who received PI-containing regimens had twelve times higher odds of death at 3 years compared to patients who were not exposed to PIs (odds ratio, 12.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.31-1602; p=0.02). \xa0Three-year death-censored graft survival was lower in patients receiving PI vs. patients on PI-sparing regimens (82 vs 100%, p=0.03). Patients receiving integrase strand transfer inhibitors-containing regimens had higher 3-year graft survival. There were no differences in the incidence of acute rejection by ART regimen. Individuals receiving PIs had a higher incidence of serious infections compared to those on PI-sparing regimens (39 vs. 8%, p=0.01).\xa0Conclusions: PI-containing ART regimens are associated with adverse outcomes in HIV+ kidney transplant recipients.', u'/articles/5-2893/v1', ['Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases'], [u'Department of Medicine, Jackson Memorial Hospital, Miami, USA', u'UnityPoint Health, Des Moines, USA', u'Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, USA', u'Department of Medicine, Division of Nephrology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, USA', u'Department of Surgery, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine and Miami Transplant Institute at the Jackson Memorial Hospital, Miami, USA']]
[u'Case Report: Use of reinforced buccal mucosa graft over gracilis muscle flap in management of post high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) rectourethral fistula', ['Shrikant Jai', 'Arvind Ganpule', 'Abhishek Singh', 'Mohankumar Vijaykumar', 'Vinod Bopaiah', 'Ravindra Sabnis', 'Mahesh Desai'], u'21 Dec 2016', u'High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has come forward as alternative treatment for carcinoma of the prostate. Though minimally invasive,HIFUhas potential side effects. Urethrorectal fistula is one such rare side effect. To our knowledge this is first case in which rectourethral fistula secondary to HIFU was repaired with buccal mucosa graft (BMG) over a harvest bed of gracilis flap.\r\nThis case report describes points of technique that will help successful management of resilient rectourethral fistula. Urinary and faecal diversion in the form of suprapubic catheter and colostomy is vital. Adequate time between stoma formation, fistula closure and then finally stoma closure is needed. Lithotomy position and perineal approach gives best exposure to the fistula. The rectum should be dissected 2cm above the fistula; this aids in tension free closure of the rectal defect. Similarly buccal mucosal graft was used on the urethra to achieve tension free closure. A good vascular pedicle gracilis muscle flap is used to interpose between the two repairs. This not only provides a physical barrier but also provides a vascular bed for BMG uptake. Perfect haemostasis is essential, as any collection may become a site of infection thus compromising results.\r\n\xa0We strongly recommend rectourethral fistula be directly repaired with gracilis muscle flap with reinforced buccal mucosa graft without attempting any less invasive repairs because the \u201cfirst chance is the best chance\u201d.', u'/articles/5-2891/v1', ['Endocrinology & Gastroenterology'], [u'Dept. of Urology, Muljibhaipatel Urological Hospital, Gujarat, India', u'Staten Island University Hospital, Staten Island, USA']]
[u'An open and transparent process to select ELIXIR Node Services as implemented by ELIXIR-UK', ['John M. Hancock', 'Alf Game', 'Chris P. Ponting', 'Carole A. Goble'], u'21 Dec 2016', u'ELIXIR is the European infrastructure established specifically for the sharing and sustainability of life science data. To provide up-to-date resources and services, ELIXIR needs to undergo a continuous process of refreshing the services provided by its national Nodes. Here we present the approach taken by ELIXIR-UK to address the advice by the ELIXIR Scientific Advisory Board that Nodes need to develop \u201cmechanisms to ensure that each Node continues to be representative of the Bioinformatics efforts within the country\u201d. ELIXIR-UK put in place an open and transparent process to identify potential ELIXIR resources within the UK during late 2015 and early to mid-2016. Areas of strategic strength were identified and Expressions of Interest in these priority areas were requested from the UK community. A set of criteria were established, in discussion with the ELIXIR Hub, and prospective ELIXIR-UK resources were assessed by an independent committee set up by the Node for this purpose. Of 19 resources considered, 14 were judged to be immediately ready to be included in the UK ELIXIR Node\u2019s portfolio. A further five were placed on the Node\u2019s roadmap for future consideration for inclusion. ELIXIR-UK expects to repeat this process regularly to ensure its portfolio continues to reflect its community\u2019s strengths.', u'/articles/5-2894/v1', ['Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'Earlham Institute, Norwich Research Park, Norwich, UK', u'Tatterdemalion Solutions, Marlborough, UK', u'MRC Human Genetics Unit, The Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK', u'School of Computer Science, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK']]
