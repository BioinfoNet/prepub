[u'Computational design of molecular motors as nanocircuits in Leishmaniasis', ['Dipali Kosey', 'Shailza Singh'], u'31 Jan 2017', u'Cutaneous leishmaniasis is the most common form of lesihmaniasis, caused by Leishmania major and is spread by the bite of a sandfly.This species infects the macrophages and dendritic cells Due to multi-drug resistance, there is a need for a new therapeutic technique. Recently, a novel molecular motor of Leishmania, Myosin XXI, was classified and characterized. In addition, the drug resistance in this organism has been linked with the overexpression of ABC transporters. Systems biology aims to study the simulation and modeling of natural biological systems whereas synthetic biology deals with building novel and artificial biological parts and devices \xa0Together they have contributed enormously to drug discovery, vaccine design and development, infectious disease detection and diagnostics. Synthetic genetic regulatory networks with desired properties, like toggling and oscillation have been proposed to be useful for gene therapy. In this work, a nanocircuit with coupled bistable switch \u2013 repressilator \xa0has been designed, simulated in the presence and absence of inducer, in silico, using Tinker Cell. When inducer is added, the circuit has been shown to produce reporter at high levels, which will impair the activity of Myosin XXI and ABC transporters. Validation of the circuit was also performed using GRENITS and BoolNet. The influence of inducer on the working of the circuit, i.e., the type of gene expression, response time delay, the steady states formed by the circuit and the quasipotential landscape of the circuit were performed. It was found that the addition of inducer reduced the response time delay in the graded type of gene expression and removed the multiple intermediate attractors of the circuit. Thus, the inducer increased the probability of the circuit to be present in the dominant stable state with high reporter concentration and hence the designed nanocircuit may be used for the treatment of leishmaniasis.', u'/articles/6-94/v1', ['Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'National Centre for Cell Science, NCCS Complex, SP Pune University Campus, Pune, India']]
[u'Prenatal brain MRI samples for development of automatic segmentation, target- recognition and machine-learning algorithms to detect anatomical structures', ['Hugues Gentillon', 'Ludomir Stefanczyk', 'Micha Strzelecki', 'Maria Respondek-Liberska'], u'31 Jan 2017', u'In this data note, we present a sorted pool of fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) specimens, selected for a project seeking to further develop a computer-vision software called MaZda, originally created for magnetic resonance (MR) image analysis. A link to download the samples is provided in the manuscript herein. This data descriptor further explains how and why these fetal MRI samples were selected. Firstly, thousands of cross-sectional images obtained from fetal MRI scans were processed and sorted semi-manually with other software. We did so because a built-in \u201csamplesort\u201d (sorting algorithm) is missing in MaZda version 5. Additionally, the software is unfortunately lacking effective and efficient algorithms to allow automatic identification and segmentation of anatomical structures in fetal MRI samples. Hence, the finals sorting steps were carried out manually via time-consuming methods \u2014 i.e. human- visual detection and classifications by the gestational age of pregnancy and the rotational plane of the MR scanner. Thus the latter correlates with the anatomical plane of the mother, rather than the hypothetical plane used to transect the fetus. In brief, we collated these fetal MRI samples in an effort to facilitate future research and discovery, especially to aid the improvement of MaZda.', u'/articles/6-93/v1', ['Urology, Gynecology & Obstetrics'], [u'Department of Radiology and Diagnostic Imaging, Barlicki University Hospital, Medical University of \u0141\xf3d\u017a, \u0141\xf3d\u017a, Poland', u'Institute of Electronics, The Faculty of Electrical, Electronic, Computer and Control Engineering, Technical University of \u0141\xf3d\u017a, \u0141\xf3d\u017a, Poland', u'Diagnosis and Prevention of Congenital Malformations, Instytut Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki, \u0141\xf3d\u017a, Poland']]
