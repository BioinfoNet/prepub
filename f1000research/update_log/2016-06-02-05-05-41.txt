[u'Results\xa0of\xa0an\xa0attempt\xa0to\xa0reproduce\xa0the\xa0STAP\xa0phenomenon', ['Shinichi Aizawa'], u'01 Jun 2016', u'In 2014, Obokata and colleagues reported their observation of a novel cell reprogramming phenomenon they named \u2018stimulus-triggered acquisition of pluripotency\u2019 (STAP). The most conclusive evidence for the pluripotency of so-called STAP cells was the purported ability of such cells to contribute to chimera formation. Here, I report the results of an attempt by Haruko Obokata to replicate the phenomenon under the supervision of the Scientific Validity Examination Team of RIKEN. In this follow-up study, putative STAP cells prepared by Haruko Obokata were injected into 1051 embryos, of which 591 were recovered. However, the injected cells made no significant contribution in any tissue in any of the embryos that developed.', u'/articles/5-1056/v1', ['Development & Evolution', 'Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology'], [u'Scientific Validity Examination Team, RIKEN, Kobe, Japan']]
[u'Making dimers of oligomeric membrane proteins using copper-free click chemistry', ['Wang Dong', 'James N. Sturgis'], u'01 Jun 2016', u'Here we describe the development of a protocol to make small oligomers, dimers and trimers, from highly oligomeric membrane proteins. The proteins that we used are the light harvesting 2 proteins and core complexes from photosynthetic bacteria, which contain respectively 16 and 56 individual polypeptides. Creating specific dimers between such multimeric protein poses several problems. We propose a protocol based on asymmetric lysine localization, thanks to the positive inside rule, and copper-free click chemistry. With this method we are able to produce specific dimeric complexes in detergent solution of possible biological relevance.', u'/articles/5-1061/v1', ['Plant Biology, Ecology & Environmental Sciences'], [u'LISM UMR 7255 Aix-Marseille University and CNRS, Marseille, France']]
