[u'A fully featured COMBINE archive of a simulation study on syncytial mitotic cycles in Drosophila embryos', ['Martin Scharm', 'Dagmar Waltemath'], u'29 Sep 2016', u'COMBINE archives are standardised containers for data files related to a simulation study in computational biology. This manuscript describes a fully featured archive of a previously published simulation study, including (i) the original publication, (ii) the model, (iii) the analyses, and (iv) metadata describing the files and their origin. With the archived data at hand, it is possible to reproduce the results of the original work. The archive can be used for both, educational and research purposes. Anyone may reuse, extend and update the archive to make it a valuable resource for the scientific community.', u'/articles/5-2421/v1', ['Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'Department of Systems Biology and Bioinformatics, Institute of Computer Science, University of Rostock, Rostock, Germany']]
