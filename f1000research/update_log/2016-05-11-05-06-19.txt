[u'Hox genes and evolution', ['Steven M. Hrycaj', 'Deneen M. Wellik'], u'10 May 2016', u'Hox proteins are a deeply conserved group of transcription factors originally defined for their critical roles in governing segmental identity along the antero-posterior (AP) axis in Drosophila. Over the last 30 years, numerous data generated in evolutionarily diverse taxa have clearly shown that changes in the expression patterns of these genes are closely associated with the regionalization of the AP axis, suggesting that Hox genes have played a critical role in the evolution of novel body plans within Bilateria. Despite this deep functional conservation and the importance of these genes in AP patterning, key questions remain regarding many aspects of Hox biology. In this commentary, we highlight recent reports that have provided novel insight into the origins of the mammalian Hox cluster, the role of Hox genes in the generation of a limbless body plan, and a novel putative mechanism in which Hox genes may encode specificity along the AP axis. Although the data discussed here offer a fresh perspective, it is clear that there is still much to learn about Hox biology and the roles it has played in the evolution of the Bilaterian body plan.', u'/articles/5-859/v1', ['Development & Evolution', 'Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology', 'Plant Biology, Ecology & Environmental Sciences'], [u'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, 48109-2200, USA', u'Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, 48109-2200, USA']]
[u'Case Report: Successful delivery in a 44-year-old woman using vitrified human oocytes taken from the woman at 41 years of age', ['Miyako Funabiki', 'Yoshitaka Nakamura', 'Sagiri Taguchi'], u'10 May 2016', u'Successful pregnancies and deliveries are rare in women over 40 years of age. To date, no case report has been published about a successful delivery in a woman over 40 years of age using vitrified oocytes obtained through social egg freezing from a woman over 40 years of age. Here we report a case of a successful live birth from a 44-year-old woman using vitrified oocytes taken from the woman at 41 years of age; the patient used the technique for social reasons. The 44-year-old patient delivered a 2534 g female infant by Caesarean section in the 37th week of\xa0pregnancy. The female infant\u2019s Apgar scores were 9 at 1\u2005min and 9 at 5\u2005min. The female infant exhibited no anomalies and is developing normally under the close surveillance of pediatricians.However, the concept of social egg freezing has medical, ethical and social problems. Furthermore, the rate of live births differs among clinics and/or hospitals due to variations in the vitrification and warming techniques used. Therefore, information from individual clinics and/or hospitals about the risks, the rates of successful live births and the cost of social egg freezing should be provided to patients to aid in the patient\u2019s decision-making process.', u'/articles/5-862/v1', ['Urology, Gynecology & Obstetrics'], [u'IVF Center, Oak Clinic, Osaka, Japan']]
