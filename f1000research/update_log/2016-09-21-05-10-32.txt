[u'Saccharomyces cerevisiae single-copy plasmids for auxotrophy compensation, multiple marker selection, and for designing metabolically cooperating communities', ['Michael Mulleder', 'Kate Campbell', 'Olga Matsarskaia', 'Florian Eckerstorfer', 'Markus Ralser'], u'20 Sep 2016', u'Auxotrophic markers are useful tools in cloning and genome editing, enable a large spectrum of genetic techniques, as well as facilitate the study of metabolite exchange interactions in microbial communities. If unused background auxotrophies are left uncomplemented however, yeast cells need to be grown in nutrient supplemented or rich growth media compositions, which precludes the analysis of biosynthetic metabolism, and which leads to a profound impact on physiology and gene expression. Here we present a series of 23 centromeric plasmids designed to restore prototrophy in typical Saccharomyces cerevisiae laboratory strains. The 23 single-copy plasmids complement for deficiencies in HIS3, LEU2, URA3, MET17 or LYS2 genes and in their combinations, to match the auxotrophic background of the popular functional-genomic yeast libraries that are based on the S288c strain. The plasmids are further suitable for designing self-establishing metabolically cooperating (SeMeCo) communities, and possess a uniform multiple cloning site to exploit multiple parallel selection markers in protein expression experiments.', u'/articles/5-2351/v1', ['Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'Department of Biochemistry and Cambridge Systems Biology Centre, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK', u'Mill Hill Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute, London, UK', u'Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden']]
[u'biojs-io-biom, a BioJS component for handling data in Biological Observation Matrix (BIOM) format', ['Markus J. Ankenbrand', 'Niklas Terhoeven', 'Sonja Hohlfeld', 'Frank Forster', 'Alexander Keller'], u'20 Sep 2016', u"The Biological Observation Matrix (BIOM) format is widely used to store data from high-throughput studies. It aims at increasing interoperability of bioinformatic tools that process this data. However, due to multiple versions and implementation details, working with this format can be tricky. Currently, libraries in Python, R and Perl are available, whilst such for JavaScript are lacking. Here, we present a BioJS component for parsing BIOM data in all format versions. It supports import, modification, and export via a unified interface. This module aims to facilitate the development of web applications that use BIOM data. Finally, we demonstrate it's usefulness by two applications that already use this component.
