Promoting, scaling up data and information sharing between African researchers and international partners are of vital importance in accelerating open access at no cost. Free Open Access (FOA) health data and information acceptability, uptake tactics and sustainable mechanisms are urgently needed. These are critical in establishing real time and effective knowledge or evidence-based translation, proven and validated approaches, strategies and tools to strengthen and revamp health systems.\xa0 As such, early and timely access to needed emerging public health information is meant to be instrumental and valuable for policy-makers, implementers, care providers, researchers, health-related institutions and stakeholders including populations when guiding health financing, and planning contextual programs.', u'/articles/5-853/v1', ['Public Health & Epidemiology', 'Publishing, Education & Communication'], [u'Department of Biochemistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Universite des Montagnes, Bangangt\xe9, Cameroon', u'Africa Disease Intelligence and Surveillance, Communication and Response (Africa DISCoR) Foundation, Yaound\xe9, Cameroon', u'Africa Population and Health Research Center (APHRC), Nairobi, Kenya', u'Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research (NMIMR), College of Health Science, University of Ghana, Greater Accra Region, Ghana', u'Department of Public Health, Kwara State University (KWASU), Malete, Kwara State, Nigeria', u'National Institute of Health Research, Harare, Zimbabwe', u'Department of Biomedical Sciences, School of Basic and Biomedical Sciences, University of Health and Allied Sciences (UHAS), Ho, Volta Region, Ghana', u'Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Kampala International University, Kansaga, Kampala, Uganda', u'Service de Biochimie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU), Yaound\xe9, Cameroon']]
[u'Healing through language: Positive physical health effects of indigenous language use', ['D. H. Whalen', 'Margaret Moss', 'Daryl Baldwin'], u'09 May 2016', u'This article summarizes existing work that indicates language maintenance and revitalization efforts result in health-related benefits for Native Americans and other indigenous populations. Although forced loss of ancestral language has been a feature of life in most indigenous communities since the first contact with Europeans, the pace of loss has accelerated in the past 50 years. Among the many hardships such communities face, an especially troubling one is lowered health status. There are indications, however, that language maintenance and revitalization efforts have positive effects on physical and communal health among indigenous populations. The types of language programs currently in place are outlined along with a variety of studies that will measure health improvement outcomes correlated with language revitalization efforts. Such evidence justifies increased support for language revitalization in order to improve health.', u'/articles/5-852/v1', ['Public Health & Epidemiology'], [u'Endangered Language Fund, New Haven, CT, USA', u'Speech-Language-Hearing Sciences, Graduate Center, City University of New York, New York, NY, USA', u'Haskins Laboratories, New Haven, CT, USA', u'Linguistics, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA', u'School of Nursing, University of Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA', u'The Myaamia Center, Miami University, Oxford, OH, USA']]

The GDSC and CCLE investigators recently reported that their respective studies exhibit reasonable agreement and yield similar molecular predictors of drug response, seemingly contradicting our previous findings. Reanalyzing the authors\u2019 published methods and results, we found that their analysis failed to account for variability in the genomic data and more importantly compared different drug sensitivity measures from each study, which substantially deviate from our more stringent consistency assessment. Our comparison of the most updated genomic and pharmacological data from the GDSC and CCLE confirms our published findings that the measures of drug response reported by these two groups are not consistent. We believe that a principled approach to assess the reproducibility of drug sensitivity predictors is necessary before envisioning their translation into clinical settings.', u'/articles/5-825/v1', ['Public Health & Epidemiology', 'Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 1L7, Canada', u'Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 1L7, Canada', u'Institut de recherches cliniques de Montr\xe9al, Montreal, Quebec, H2W 1R7, Canada', u'Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 1X8, Canada', u'Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, M5S 2E4, Canada', u'University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, UK', u'Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, 10065, USA', u'The HRH Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Bin Abdulaziz Alsaud Institute for Computational Biomedicine, New York, NY, 10021, USA', u'The Feil Family Brain and Mind Research Institute (BMRI), New York, NY, 10065, USA', u'Section of Medical Oncology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, 06520, USA', u'Yale Cancer Center, Yale University, New Haven, CT, 06510, USA', u'Fudan University, Shanghai City, 200135, China', u'University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, 72205, USA', u'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, 02215, USA', u"Department of Radiation Oncology and Radiology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02215, USA", u'Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology and Center for Cancer Computational Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02215, USA']]
