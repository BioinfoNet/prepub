[u'Candida antifungal drug resistance in sub-Saharan African populations: A systematic review', ['Charlene Wilma Joyce  Africa', 'Pedro Miguel dos Santos  Abrantes'], u'08 Dec 2016', u'Background: Candida infections are responsible for increased morbidity and mortality rates in at-risk patients, especially in developing countries where there is limited access to antifungal drugs and a high burden of HIV co-infection.\xa0Objectives: This study aimed to identify antifungal drug resistance patterns within the subcontinent of Africa.\xa0Methods: A literature search was conducted on published studies that employed antifungal susceptibility testing on clinical Candida isolates from sub-Saharan African countries using Pubmed and Google Scholar.\xa0Results: A total of 21 studies from 8 countries constituted this review. Only studies conducted in sub-Saharan Africa and employing antifungal drug susceptibility testing were included. Regional differences in Candida species prevalence and resistance patterns were identified.\xa0Discussion: The outcomes of this review highlight the need for a revision of antifungal therapy guidelines in regions most affected by Candida drug resistance. \xa0Better controls in antimicrobial drug distribution and the implementation of regional antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance programmes are required in order to reduce the high Candida drug resistance levels seen to be emerging in sub-Saharan Africa.', u'/articles/5-2832/v1', ['Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'Microbial Endogenous Infections (MEnIS) Research Laboratories, Department of Medical Biosciences, University of the Western Cape, Bellville, South Africa']]
[u'Effect of diclofenac suppository on pain control during flexible cystoscopy-A randomized controlled trial', ['Mehwash Nadeem', 'M Hammad Ather'], u'08 Dec 2016', u'TRIAL DESIGN: To compare the difference in pain score during flexible cystoscopy between patients undergoing the procedure with plain lubricating gel\xa0 only and plain gel with diclofenac suppository in a randomized control trial.\nMETHODS:\xa0 A total of 60 male patients with an indication of flexible cystoscopy were enrolled in a prospective, randomized controlled study. Patients were randomized in two groups. In group \u201cA\u201d, patients received diclofenac suppository one hour prior to the procedure while group \u201cB\u201d did not receive diclofenac suppository. Both groups received 10 ml of intra-urethral \xa0plain gel for lubrication during flexible cystoscopy. Pain score was recorded immediately after the procedure using the visual analogue scale (VAS). Pre- and post-procedure pulse rate and systolic blood pressure was also recorded. Statistical analyses were performed using chi-square test and student t-test. Regression analysis was performed to address the confounding variables.\nRESULTS: Both groups were comparable for variables including age, duration of procedure, level of operating surgeon and indication of procedure. Most common indication for flexible cystoscopy was removal of double J stent. There was a statistically significant difference in the mean pain score between two groups (p\xa0= 0.012).\xa0 The difference in post-procedure mean pulse rate in the two groups was statistically significant (p= 0.01) however there was no difference observed in mean post procedure systolic blood pressure. Regression analysis showed that none of the confounding variables were significantly affecting pain perception.\nCONCLUSIONS: Intra rectal diclofenac suppository is simple and effective pre-emptive analgesia. We recommend its routine use during flexible cystoscopy for better pain control.', u'/articles/5-2834/v1', ['Endocrinology & Gastroenterology'], [u'Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakistan']]
