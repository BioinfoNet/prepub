[u'Spanish translation and preliminary validation of the Pain Treatment Satisfaction Scale', ['Teresa A. Nava-Obregon', 'Daniel A. Fragoso-Estrada', 'Sandra Castillo-Guzman', 'Norma G. Lopez-Cabrera', 'Omar Gonzalez-Santiago', 'Dionicio Palacios-Rioas'], u'25 May 2016', u'Satisfactory pain treatment could prevent adverse physical and psychological outcomes in patients. In this sense, adequate survey to measure patient satisfaction of pain management is important. In this study, we translated the Pain Treatment Satisfaction Scale to Spanish and analyzed the psychometric properties of its five dimensions. Reliability was determined with Chronbach\xb4s-\u03b1 and convergent and divergent validity with a multitrait-multimethod analysis. The latter were reported as successful percentage. In the five dimensions, the reliability of the Spanish version showed Chronbach\xb4s-\u03b1 values \u2265 0.75; successful percentage for convergent validity was \u2265 88, and successful percentage for divergent validity was \u2265 94. The Spanish version showed good psychometric properties and can be used to measure pain treatment satisfaction.', u'/articles/5-996/v1', ['Public Health & Epidemiology'], [u'Pain and Palliative Care Clinic, Anesthesiology Service, Dr Jose E Gonz\xe1lez University Hospital, Nuevo Le\xf3n, Mexico', u'Postgraduate division of the Faculty of Chemical Science, Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Le\xf3n, Nuevo Le\xf3n, Mexico']]
[u'The germinal center antibody response in health and disease', ['Anthony L. DeFranco'], u'25 May 2016', u'The germinal center response is the delayed but sustained phase of the antibody response that is responsible for producing high-affinity antibodies of the IgG, IgA and/or IgE isotypes. B cells in the germinal center undergo re-iterative cycles of somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin gene variable regions, clonal expansion, and Darwinian selection for cells expressing higher-affinity antibody variants. Alternatively, selected B cells can terminally differentiate into long-lived plasma cells or into a broad diversity of mutated memory B cells; the former secrete the improved antibodies to fight an infection and to provide continuing protection from re-infection, whereas the latter may jumpstart immune responses to subsequent infections with related but distinct infecting agents. Our understanding of the molecules involved in the germinal center reaction has been informed by studies of human immunodeficiency patients with selective defects in the production of antibodies. Recent studies have begun to reveal how innate immune recognition via Toll-like receptors can enhance the magnitude and selective properties of the germinal center, leading to more effective control of infection by a subset of viruses. Just as early insights into the nature of the germinal center found application in the development of the highly successful conjugate vaccines, more recent insights may find application in the current efforts to develop new generations of vaccines, including vaccines that can induce broadly protective neutralizing antibodies against influenza virus or HIV-1.', u'/articles/5-999/v1', ['Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases', 'Oncology & Hematology', 'Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA']]
[u'Focusing super resolution on the cytoskeleton', ['Eric A. Shelden', 'Zachary T. Colburn', 'Jonathan C.R. Jones'], u'25 May 2016', u'Super resolution imaging is becoming an increasingly important tool in the arsenal of methods available to cell biologists. In recognition of its potential, the Nobel Prize for chemistry was awarded to three investigators involved in the development of super resolution imaging methods in 2014. The availability of commercial instruments for super resolution imaging has further spurred the development of new methods and reagents designed to take advantage of super resolution techniques. Super resolution offers the advantages traditionally associated with light microscopy, including the use of gentle fixation and specimen preparation methods, the ability to visualize multiple elements within a single specimen, and the potential to visualize dynamic changes in living specimens over time. However, imaging of living cells over time is difficult and super resolution imaging is computationally demanding. In this review, we discuss the advantages/disadvantages of different super resolution systems for imaging fixed live specimens, with particular regard to cytoskeleton structures.', u'/articles/5-998/v1', ['Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'School of Molecular Biosciences, Washington State University, Pullman, WA, USA']]
