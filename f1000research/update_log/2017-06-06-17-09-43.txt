[u'Community and Code: Nine Lessons from Nine NESCent Hackathons', ['Arlin Stoltzfus', 'Michael Rosenberg', 'Hilmar Lapp', 'Aidan Budd', 'Karen Cranston', 'Enrico Pontelli', 'Shann Oliver', 'Rutger A. Vos'], u'06 Jun 2017', u'In recent years, there has been an explosion in the popularity of hackathons \u2014 creative, participant-driven meetings at which software developers gather for an intensive bout of programming, often organized in teams. Hackathons have tangible and intangible outcomes, such as code, excitement, learning, networking, and so on, whose relative merits are unclear. For example, a frequent complaint is that code is abandoned when the hackathon ends, and questions like, \u201cwhich outcomes are produced most reliably?\u201d and, \u201chow valuable are they for participants, organizers, and sponsors?\u201d remain open. As a first step in giving \u201chackology\u201d a more rigorous footing, this paper describes the NESCent hackathon model, developed over the course of a decade to serve the academic discipline of evolutionary biology, with the dual goals of augmenting the community\u2019s shared software infrastructure, and fostering a diverse community of practice in open scientific software development. The paper presents a detailed guide to staging a NESCent-style hackathon, along with a structured information set on nine events involving 54 team projects. NESCent hackathons have produced tangible products with downstream impacts, including prototypes that were leveraged for major funding, incremental additions to production code bases, and creative drafts (designs, standards, and proofs-of-concept) that contributed to further work. The impacts of intangible outcomes could not be assessed objectively, but the subjective experience suggests that hackathons have a positive impact by (1) providing individuals with valuable experiences, networking, and training, and (2) fostering a more cohesive community of practice by enhancing awareness of challenges and best practices and by building links of familiarity between and among resources and people. Future research that recognizes the diverse outcomes of hackathons might enable evidence-based decisions about how to design hackathons for effectiveness.', u'/articles/6-786/v1', ['Publishing, Education & Communication', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'Institute for Bioscience and Biotechnology Research, University of Maryland, 9600 Gudelsky Drive, Rockville, MD, 20850, USA', u'School of Life Sciences, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona, USA', u'Center for Genomic and Computational Biology (GCB), Duke University, Durham, NC, 27708, USA', u'Structural and Computational Biology Unit, European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), Meyerhofstra\xdfe 1, 69117 Heidelberg, Germany', u'Earlham Institute, Norwich Research Park, Norwich, NR4 7UG, UK', u'Biology Department, Duke University, Durham, NC, 27708, USA', u'Computer Science Department, New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, NM, USA', u'Guardant Health, Redwood City, CA, USA', u'Naturalis Biodiversity Center, Vondellaan 55, 2332 AA, Leiden, Netherlands']]
[u'Improved deconvolution of very weak confocal signals', ['Kasey J. Day', 'Patrick J. La Riviere', 'Talon Chandler', 'Vytas P. Bindokas', 'Nicola J. Ferrier', 'Benjamin S. Glick'], u'06 Jun 2017', u'Deconvolution is typically used to sharpen fluorescence images, but when the signal-to-noise ratio is low, the primary benefit is reduced noise and a smoother appearance of the fluorescent structures. 3D time-lapse (4D) confocal image sets can be improved by deconvolution. However, when the confocal signals are very weak, the popular Huygens deconvolution software erases fluorescent structures that are clearly visible in the raw data. We find that this problem can be avoided by prefiltering the optical sections with a Gaussian blur. Analysis of real and simulated data indicates that the Gaussian blur prefilter preserves meaningful signals while enabling removal of background noise. This approach is very simple, and it allows Huygens to be used with 4D imaging conditions that minimize photodamage.', u'/articles/6-787/v1', ['Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology'], [u'Department of Molecular Genetics and Cell Biology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, 60637, USA', u'Department of Radiology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, 5841, USA', u'Integrated Light Microscopy Core Facility, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, 60637, USA', u'Computation Institute, University of Chicago Mathematics and Computer Science, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL, 60439, USA', u'', u'', u'Kasey J.

Adverse drug reactions (\u2018side effects\u2019) are its principal manifestation, but polypharmacology is also playing a role in the repositioning of existing drugs for new therapeutic indications.\xa0 Polyspecificity, on the other hand, is the capability of a given target to exhibit activity with respect to multiple, structurally dissimilar drugs.\xa0 That these concepts are closely related to one another is, surprisingly, not well known.\xa0 It will be shown in this work that they are, in fact, mathematically related to one another and are in essence \u2018two sides of the same coin\u2019.\xa0 Hence, information on polypharmacology provides equivalent information on polyspecificity, and vice versa.\r\nNetworks are playing an increasingly important role in biological research.
