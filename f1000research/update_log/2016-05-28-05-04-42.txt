[u'Early-childhood housing mobility and subsequent PTSD in adolescence: a Moving to Opportunity reanalysis', ['David C. Norris', 'Andrew Wilson'], u'27 May 2016', u'In a 2014 report on adolescent mental health outcomes in the Moving to Opportunity\xa0for Fair Housing Demonstration (MTO), Kessler et al. reported that, at 10-\xa0to 15-year follow-up, boys from households randomized to an experimental housing\xa0voucher intervention experienced 12-month prevalence of post-traumatic stress\xa0disorder (PTSD) at several times the rate of boys from control households. We reanalyze\xa0this finding here, bringing to light a PTSD outcome imputation procedure used\xa0in the original analysis, but not described in the study report. By bootstrapping with\xa0repeated draws from the frequentist sampling distribution of the imputation model\xa0used by Kessler et al., and by varying two pseudorandom number generator seeds\xa0that fed their analysis, we account for several purely statistical components of the\xa0uncertainty inherent in their imputation procedure. We also discuss other sources\xa0of uncertainty in this procedure that were not accessible to a formal reanalysis.', u'/articles/5-1014/v1', ['Public Health & Epidemiology', 'Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'David Norris Consulting, LLC, Seattle, WA, 98102-5384, USA', u'College of Nursing, University of Utah Health Sciences Center, Salt Lake City, UT, 84132, USA', u'Anolinx LLC, Bountiful, UT, 84010, USA']]
[u'Some vexations that challenge viral immunology', ['Barry T. Rouse', 'Scott N.

[u'Effects of flanker type and position on foveal letter recognition', ['Mohd Izzuddin Hairol', 'Qazi Mohamad Omair', 'Sharanjeet Kaur'], u'27 May 2016', u'Our ability to identify a foveally viewed letter at resolution threshold reduces when flankers are placed at a certain distance from it, compared to when it is presented on its own.\xa0 In this study, we investigated how type and position of flankers influences foveal letter recognition. We measured participants\u2019 performance to identify unflanked Sheridan-Gardiner letters (A, H, O, U, T, V or X), using a seven-alternative-forced-choice paradigm with the method of constant stimuli to obtain 80-90% correct response. Performance was measured again to identify a target letter in the presence of different flanker types.\xa0 Flankers were bars and letters (placed either to the left and right of the target, above and below the target or on four sides of the target), and a surrounding box.\xa0 Separation between the target letter and flankers varied between zero (abutting) and ten stroke widths (two letter sizes).\xa0 For all flanker types, separation between the target ad the flankers significantly influenced performance (all p < 0.0001). Flankers abutting the target and at separation of one stroke width caused the largest reduction in performance, regardless of flanker type. For bar flankers, the largest drop in performance (up to 50 percent) occurred with bars placed on all four sides of the target. For letter flankers, flankers placed above and below the target reduced performance as much as four surrounding flankers. At separation of one stroke width, flanking letters and bars caused a further 10% reduction in performance than a surrounding box. Our results would have significant implications on the design of crowded visual acuity charts, especially those that are available on the market, which have different crowding features between them.', u'/articles/5-1013/v1', ['Eye Disorders & ENT'], [u'Optometry & Vision Science Programme, Faculty of Health Sciences, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Jalan Raja Muda Abdul Aziz, Kuala Lumpur, 50300, Malaysia']]
[u'Improving outcome of sensorimotor functions after traumatic spinal cord injury', ['Volker Dietz'], u'27 May 2016', u'In the rehabilitation of a patient suffering a spinal cord injury (SCI), the exploitation of neuroplasticity is well established. It can be facilitated through the training of functional movements with technical assistance as needed and can improve outcome after an SCI. The success of such training in individuals with incomplete SCI critically depends on the presence of physiological proprioceptive input to the spinal cord leading to meaningful muscle activations during movement performances. Some actual preclinical approaches to restore function by compensating for the loss of descending input to spinal networks following complete/incomplete SCI are critically discussed in this report. Electrical and pharmacological stimulation of spinal neural networks is still in the experimental stage, and despite promising repair studies in animal models, translations to humans up to now have not been convincing. It is possible that a combination of techniques targeting the promotion of axonal regeneration is necessary to advance the restoration of function. In the future, refinement of animal models according to clinical conditions and requirements may contribute to greater translational success.', u'/articles/5-1018/v1', ['Development & Evolution', 'Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry', 'Critical Care & Emergency Medicine'], [u'Spinal Cord Injury Center, Balgrist University Hospital, Forchstrasse 340, Z\xfcrich, CH-8008, Switzerland']]
[u'Recent advances in managing a spinal cord injury secondary to trauma', ['Christopher S. Ahuja', 'Allan R. Martin', 'Michael Fehlings'], u'27 May 2016', u'Traumatic spinal cord injuries (SCIs) affect 1.3 million North Americans, producing devastating physical, social, and vocational impairment. Pathophysiologically, the initial mechanical trauma is followed by a significant secondary injury which includes local ischemia, pro-apoptotic signaling, release of cytotoxic factors, and inflammatory cell infiltration. Expedient delivery of medical and surgical care during this critical period can improve long-term functional outcomes, engendering the concept of \u201cTime is Spine\u201d. We emphasize the importance of expeditious care while outlining the initial clinical and radiographic assessment of patients. Key evidence-based early interventions (surgical decompression, blood pressure augmentation, and methylprednisolone) are also reviewed, including findings of the landmark Surgical Timing in Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study (STASCIS). We then describe other neuroprotective approaches on the edge of translation such as the sodium-channel blocker riluzole, the anti-inflammatory minocycline, and therapeutic hypothermia. We also review promising neuroregenerative therapies that are likely to influence management practices over the next decade including chondroitinase, Rho-ROCK pathway inhibition, and bioengineered strategies. The importance of emerging neural stem cell therapies to remyelinate denuded axons and regenerate neural circuits is also discussed. Finally, we outline future directions for research and patient care.', u'/articles/5-1017/v1', ['Development & Evolution', 'Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry', 'Critical Care & Emergency Medicine'], [u'Division of Neurosurgery, Department of Surgery, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada', u'Institute of Medical Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada', u'McEwen Centre for Regenerative Medicine, UHN, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada', u'Department of Surgery, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada', u'Spine Program, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada', u'McLaughlin Center in Molecular Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada']]
