[u'Recent insights: mesenchymal stromal/stem cell therapy for acute respiratory distress syndrome', ['Shahd Horie', 'John G. Laffey'], u'28 Jun 2016', u'Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) causes respiratory failure, which is associated with severe inflammation and lung damage and has a high mortality and for which there is no therapy. Mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) are adult multi-progenitor cells that can modulate the immune response and enhance repair of damaged tissue and thus may provide a therapeutic option for ARDS. MSCs demonstrate efficacy in diverse in vivo models of ARDS, decreasing bacterial pneumonia and ischemia-reperfusion-induced injury while enhancing repair following ventilator-induced lung injury. MSCs reduce the pro-inflammatory response to injury while augmenting the host response to bacterial infection. MSCs appear to exert their effects via multiple mechanisms\u2014some are cell interaction dependent whereas others are paracrine dependent resulting from both soluble secreted products and microvesicles/exosomes derived from the cells. Strategies to further enhance the efficacy of MSCs, such as by overexpressing anti-inflammatory or pro-repair molecules, are also being investigated. Encouragingly, early phase clinical trials of MSCs in patients with ARDS are under way, and experience with these cells in trials for other diseases suggests that the cells are well tolerated. Although considerable translational challenges, such as concerns regarding cell manufacture scale-up and issues regarding cell potency and batch variability, must be overcome, MSCs constitute a highly promising potential therapy for ARDS.', u'/articles/5-1532/v1', ['Cardiopulmonary & Vascular Disorders', 'Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases', 'Critical Care & Emergency Medicine'], [u'Anaesthesia, School of Medicine, Clinical Sciences Institute, National University of Ireland, Galway, Ireland', u'Regenerative Medicine Institute, National University of Ireland, Galway, Ireland', u'Department of Anesthesia, Critical Illness and Injury Research Centre, Keenan Research Centre for Biomedical Science, St Michael\u2019s Hospital, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada']]
[u'Mechanisms of low back pain: a guide for diagnosis and therapy', ['Massimo Allegri', 'Silvana Montella', 'Fabiana Salici', 'Adriana Valente', 'Maurizio Marchesini', 'Christian Compagnone', 'Marco Baciarello', 'Maria Elena Manferdini', 'Guido Fanelli'], u'28 Jun 2016', u'Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a chronic pain syndrome in the lower back region, lasting for at least 3\xa0months. CLBP represents the second leading cause of disability worldwide being a major welfare and economic problem. The prevalence of CLBP in adults has increased more than 100% in the last decade and continues to increase dramatically in the aging population, affecting both men and women in all ethnic groups, with a significant impact on functional capacity and occupational activities. It can also be influenced by psychological factors, such as stress, depression and/or anxiety. Given this complexity, the diagnostic evaluation of patients with CLBP can be very challenging and requires complex clinical decision-making. Answering the question \u201cwhat is the pain generator\u201d among the several structures potentially involved in CLBP is a key factor in the management of these patients, since a mis-diagnosis can generate therapeutical mistakes. Traditionally, the notion that the etiology of 80% to 90% of LBP cases is unknown has been mistaken perpetuated across decades. In most cases, low back pain can be attributed to specific pain generator, with its own characteristics and with different therapeutical opportunity. Here we discuss about radicular pain, facet Joint pain, sacro-iliac pain, pain related to lumbar stenosis, discogenic pain. Our article aims to offer to the clinicians a simple guidance to identify pain generators in a safer and faster way, relying a correct diagnosis and further therapeutical approach.', u'/articles/5-1530/v1', ['Bone Disorders', 'Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry'], [u'Department of Surgical Sciences, University of Parma, Parma, Italy', u'Anaesthesia, Intensive Care and Pain Therapy Service, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Parma Hospital, Parma, Italy']]
[u'Neck keloids: evaluation of risk factors and recommendation for keloid staging system', ['Michael H.

[u'The regulation of hematopoietic stem cell populations', ['Hector Mayani'], u'28 Jun 2016', u'Evidence presented over the last few years indicates that the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) compartment comprises not just one but a number of different cell populations. Based on HSCs\u2019 proliferation and engraftment potential, it has been suggested that there are two classes of HSC, with long- and short-term engraftment potential. HSC heterogeneity seems to involve differentiation capacities as well, since it has been shown that some HSC clones are able to give rise to both myeloid and lymphoid progeny, whereas others are lymphoid deficient. It has been recognized that HSC function depends on intrinsic cell regulators, which are modulated by external signals. Among the former, we can include transcription factors and non-coding RNAs as well as epigenetic modifiers. Among the latter, cytokines and extracellular matrix molecules have been implicated. Understanding the elements and mechanisms that regulate HSC populations is of significant relevance both in biological and in clinical terms, and research in this area still has to face several complex and exciting challenges.', u'/articles/5-1524/v1', ['Development & Evolution', 'Oncology & Hematology', 'Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology'], [u'Hematopoietic Stem Cells Laboratory, Oncology Research Unit, IMSS National Medical Center, Mexico City, Mexico']]
[u'Production of Basal Bodies in bulk for dense multicilia formation', ['Xiumin Yan', 'Huijie Zhao', 'Xueliang Zhu'], u'28 Jun 2016', u'Centriole number is normally under tight control and is directly linked to ciliogenesis. In cells that use centrosomes as mitotic spindle poles, one pre-existing mother centriole is allowed to duplicate only one daughter centriole per cell cycle. In multiciliated cells, however, many centrioles are generated to serve as basal bodies of the cilia. Although deuterosomes were observed more than 40 years ago using electron microscopy and are believed to produce most of the basal bodies in a mother centriole-independent manner, the underlying molecular mechanisms have remained unknown until recently. From these findings arise more questions and a call for clarifications that will require multidisciplinary efforts.', u'/articles/5-1533/v1', ['Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology'], [u'State Key Laboratory of Cell Biology, CAS Centre for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China']]

Given a large biological interaction network, KeyPathwayMiner extracts connected subnetworks that are enriched for differentially active entities from a series of molecular profiles encoded as binary indicator matrices. Since interaction networks constantly evolve, an important question is how robust the extracted results are when the network is modified. We enable users to study this effect through several network perturbation techniques and over a range of perturbation degrees. In addition, users may now provide a gold-standard set to determine how enriched extracted pathways are with relevant genes compared to randomized versions of the original network.', u'/articles/5-1531/v1', ['Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Southern Denmark, 5230 Odense, Denmark', u'Department of Cancer and Inflammation Research, Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Southern Denmark, 5000 Odense, Denmark', u'Lundbeckfonden Center of Excellence in Nanomedicine NanoCAN, University of Southern Denmark, 5000 Odense, Denmark', u'Institute of Clinical Research, University of Southern Denmark, 5000 Odense, Denmark', u'Max Planck Institute for Informatics, 66123 Saarbrucken, Germany', u'Integrated Research Institute (IRI) for the Life Sciences and Department of Biology, Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin, 10099 Berlin, Germany', u'Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Biodemography, Institute of Public Health, University of Southern Denmark, 5000 Odense, Denmark', u'Department of Oncology, Odense University Hospital, 5000 Odense, Denmark']]
