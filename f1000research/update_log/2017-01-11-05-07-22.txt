[u'Characterization of BRCA1/2 mutations in patients with family history of breast cancer in Armenia', ['Sofi Atshemyan', 'Andranik Chavushyan', 'Nerses Berberian', 'Arthur Sahakyan', 'Roksana Zakharyan', 'Arsen Arakelyan'], u'10 Jan 2017', u'Background.\xa0Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women worldwide. The germline mutations of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are the most significant and well characterized genetic risk factors for hereditary breast cancer. Intensive research in the last decades has demonstrated that the incidence of mutations varies widely among different populations. In this study we attempted to perform a pilot study for identification and characterization of mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes among Armenian patients with family history of breast cancer and their healthy relatives.\xa0Methods.\xa0We performed targeted exome sequencing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in 6 patients and their healthy relatives. After alignment of short reads to the reference genome, germline single nucleotide variation and indel discovery was performed using GATK software. Functional implications of identified variants were assessed using ENSEMBL Variant Effect Predictor tool.\xa0Results.\xa0In total, 39 single nucleotide variations and 4 indels were identified, from which 15 SNPs and 3 indels were novel. No known pathogenic mutations were identified, but 2 SNPs causing missense amino acid mutations had significantly increased frequencies in the study group compared to the 1000 Genome populations.\xa0Conclusions.\xa0Our results demonstrate the importance of screening of BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene variants in the Armenian population in order to identity specifics of mutation spectrum and frequencies and enable accurate risk assessment of hereditary breast cancers.', u'/articles/6-29/v1', ['Oncology & Hematology'], [u'Institute of Molecular Biology, Armenian National Academy of Sciences, Yerevan, Armenia', u'ARTMED Medical Rehabilitation Center (CJSC), Yerevan, Armenia']]
[u'AR2, a novel automatic artifact reduction software method for ictal EEG interpretation: Validation and comparison of performance with commercially available software', ['Shennan Weiss', 'Ali A Asadi-Pooya', 'Sitaram Vangala', 'Stephanie Moy', 'Dale H Wyeth', 'Iren Orosz', 'Michael Gibbs', 'Lara Schrader', 'Jason Lerner', 'Christopher K Cheng', 'Edward Chang', 'Rajsekar Rajaraman', 'Inna Keselman', 'Perdro Churchman', 'Christine Bower-Baca', 'Adam L Numis', 'Michael G Ho', 'Lekha Rao', 'Annapoorna Bhat', 'Joanna Suski', 'Marjan Asadollahi', 'Timothy Ambrose', 'Andres Fernandez', 'Maromi Nei', 'Christopher Skidmore', 'Scott Mintzer', 'Dawn S Eliashiv', 'Gary W Mathern', 'Marc R Nuwer', 'Michael Sperling', 'Jerome Engel Jr', 'John M Stern'], u'10 Jan 2017', u'Objective: To develop a novel software method (AR2) for reducing muscle contamination of ictal scalp electroencephalogram (EEG), and validate this method on the basis of its performance in comparison to a commercially available software method (AR1) to accurately depict seizure-onset location.\nMethods: A blinded investigation used 23 EEG recordings of seizures from 8 patients. Each recording was uninterpretable with digital filtering because of muscle artifact and processed using AR1 and AR2 and reviewed by 26 EEG specialists. EEG readers assessed seizure-onset time, lateralization, and region, and specified confidence for each determination. The two methods were validated on the basis of the number of readers able to render assignments, confidence, the intra-class correlation (ICC), and agreement with other clinical findings.\nResults: Among the 23 seizures, two-thirds of the readers were able to delineate seizure-onset time in 10 of 23 using AR1, and 15 of 23 using AR2 (p<0.01). Fewer readers could lateralize seizure-onset (p<0.05). The confidence measures of the assignments were low (probable-unlikely), but increased using AR2 (p<0.05). The ICC for identifying the time of seizure-onset was 0.15 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.11-0.18) using AR1 and 0.26 (95% CI 0.21-0.30) using AR2.\xa0 The EEG interpretations were often consistent with behavioral, neurophysiological, and neuro-radiological findings, with left sided assignments correct in 95.9% (CI 85.7-98.9%, n=4) of cases using AR2.\nConclusions: EEG artifact reduction methods for localizing seizure-onset does not result in high rates of interpretability, reader confidence, and inter-reader agreement. However, the assignments by groups of readers are often congruent with other clinical data. Utilization of the AR2 software method may improve the validity of ictal EEG artifact reduction.', u'/articles/6-30/v1', ['Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry'], [u'Department of Neurology, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, USA', u'Department of Neurology, Jefferson Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, USA', u'Department of Medicine, Statistics Core, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, USA', u'Department of Radiology, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, USA', u'Departments of Neurosurgery, Psychiatry, and Biobehavioral Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California Los Angeles, os Angeles, USA']]
