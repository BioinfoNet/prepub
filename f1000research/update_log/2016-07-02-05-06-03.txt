[u'Case Report: 84 year-old woman with alien hand syndrome', ['Ihtesham aatif qureshi', 'Daniel Korya', 'Darine Kassar', 'Mohammed Moussavi'], u'01 Jul 2016', u'Background:\r\nAlien hand syndrome [AHS] is a rare and ill-defined neurological disorder. It produces complex, goal-directed motion of one hand that is involuntarily instigated. This syndrome characteristically arises after braintrauma, brain surgery, stroke or encephalitis. We describe a case of AHS in a patient who had a previous episode of subarachnoid hemorrhage affecting the left frontal lobe and corpus callosum.\nCase presentation:\r\nAn 84-year-old woman presented to the emergency department complaining of headaches and several episodes of her left arm moving as if it wasgroping around trying to grab at her own body.\xa0 A computed tomography scanof the head demonstrated an acute left superior frontal hemorrhage with compression of the corpus callosum. Transcranial Doppler report showed no significant abnormality in the insonated vessels. After being stabilized for the acute bleed, she was treated with clonazepam 0.5 mgat night for the uncontrolled hand movements.\xa0 Her movements resolved by her next month follow up. The diagnosis of AHS was made based on her clinical presentation, characterization of the movement and localization correlating with findings in neuroimaging.\nConclusion:\r\nWe document a rare neurologic disorder seen in patients presenting with a history of previous strokes and a typical description of involuntary and unintentional, uncontrolled unilateral arm movements with repetitive grasping. The presentcase has a combination of frontal and callosal lesions.\xa0 These findings appear to support a potential destruction leading to the rare syndrome.', u'/articles/5-1564/v1', ['Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry'], [u'Texas Tech University of Health Sciences Center, El Paso, USA', u'Stroke & Neurovascular Center at JFK Neuroscience Institute, Edison, USA']]
[u'Centromere detection of human metaphase chromosome\xa0images using a candidate based method', ['Akila Subasinghe', 'Jagath Samarabandu', 'YanXin Li', 'Ruth Wilkins', 'Farrah Flegal', 'Joan H. M. Knoll', 'Peter K. Rogan'], u'01 Jul 2016', u'Accurate detection of the human metaphase chromosome centromere is\xa0a critical element of cytogenetic diagnostic techniques, including chromosome enumeration,\xa0karyotyping and radiation biodosimetry. Existing centromere detection\xa0methods tends to perform poorly in the presence of irregular boundaries, shape\xa0variations and premature sister chromatid separation. We present a centromere\xa0detection algorithm that uses a novel contour partitioning technique to generate\xa0centromere candidates followed by a machine learning approach to select the best\xa0candidate that enhances the detection accuracy. The contour partitioning technique\xa0evaluates various combinations of salient points along the chromosome boundary\xa0using a novel feature set and is able to identify telomere regions as well as detect\xa0and correct for sister chromatid separation. This partitioning is used to generate a\xa0set of centromere candidates which are then evaluated based on a second set of\xa0proposed features. The proposed algorithm outperforms previously published algorithms\xa0and is shown to do so with a larger set of chromosome images. A highlight of\xa0the proposed algorithm is the ability to rank this set of centromere candidates and\xa0create a centromere confidence metric which may be used in post-detection analysis.\xa0When tested with a larger metaphase chromosome database consisting of\xa01400 chromosomes collected from 40 metaphase cell images, the proposed algorithm\xa0was able to accurately localize 1220 centromere locations yielding a detection\xa0accuracy of 87%.', u'/articles/5-1565/v1', ['Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Western University, London, ON, Canada', u'Department of Biochemistry, Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, Western University, London, ON, Canada', u'Health Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada', u'Canadian Nuclear Laboratories, Chalk River, ON, Canada', u'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry,, Western University, London, ON, Canada']]
