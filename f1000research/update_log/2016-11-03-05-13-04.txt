[u'Engagement of introductory biostatistics students in\xa0a novel hybrid course format', ['Marcel Ramos', 'Misato Gbedemah', 'Heidi Jones', 'Levi Waldron'], u'02 Nov 2016', u'Background\r\nWhile online-only courses can be delivered without constraints of geography or synchronization of lecture times, traditional in-person lectures continue to be central to teaching and to student experiences at most universities. Hybrid learning courses fill the gap between, providing convenience and schedule flexibility while maintaining the traditional face-to-face experience. The CUNY Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy and Hunter College are urban campuses that draw working students from a wide commuting area, leading us to experiment with hybrid course formats that offer a maximum degree of flexibility to students.\nMethods\r\nLectures and lab sessions were held on campus in a traditional lecture style, but streamed live over YouTube with remote attendees able to type questions and have them answered by the instructor in real time, and later made available for viewing.\nResults\r\nThrough a post-course survey we found students to be divided in their preferences for in-person course formats (46%) versus synchronous and asynchronous online formats (35% and 19%, respectively). In the hypothetical scenario of retaking the course, the option of attending each lecture either in-person or online was preferred (69% for this hybrid format, 11% for in-person only and another 11% for online only). Although long commuting times, work and family responsibilities were common, interactivity and learning preference were the most important considerations for students regardless of their decision for online or in-person attendance. Analysis of YouTube viewing data showed a majority of online participation occurring during live lectures, with an additional peak of viewing of all lectures occurring immediately before exams.\nConclusions\r\nWe found this hybrid format to be a viable and popular way to accommodate diverse personal circumstances and learning preferences within the framework of a traditional lecture format.', u'/articles/5-2624/v1', ['Publishing, Education & Communication'], [u'City University of New York School of Public Health, New York, USA', u'Department of Psychology, City University of New York Queens College, New York, USA']]
