[u'Intravital imaging reveals new ancillary mechanisms co-opted by cancer cells to drive tumor progression', ['Claire Vennin', 'David Herrmann', 'Morghan C. Lucas', 'Paul Timpson'], u'16 May 2016', u'Intravital imaging is providing new insights into the dynamics of tumor progression in native tissues and has started to reveal the layers of complexity found in cancer. Recent advances in intravital imaging have allowed us to look deeper into cancer behavior and to dissect the interactions between tumor cells and the ancillary host niche that promote cancer development. In this review, we provide an insight into the latest advances in cancer biology achieved by intravital imaging, focusing on recently discovered mechanisms by which tumor cells manipulate normal tissue to facilitate disease progression.', u'/articles/5-892/v1', ['Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases', 'Oncology & Hematology', 'Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'The Kinghorn Cancer Centre, Cancer Division, The Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Sydney, NSW, Australia', u'St Vincent\u2019s Clinical School, Faculty of Medicine, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia']]
[u'Network science for the identification of novel therapeutic targets in epilepsy', ['Rod C. Scott'], u'16 May 2016', u'The quality of life of children with epilepsy is a function of seizures and associated cognitive and behavioral comorbidities. Current treatments are not successful at stopping seizures in approximately 30% of patients despite the introduction of multiple new antiepileptic drugs over the last decade. In addition, modification of seizures has only a modest impact on the comorbidities. Therefore, novel approaches to identify therapeutic targets that improve seizures and comorbidities are urgently required. The potential of network science as applied to genetic, local neural network, and global brain data is reviewed. Several examples of possible new therapeutic approaches defined using novel network tools are highlighted. Further study to translate the findings into clinical practice is now required.', u'/articles/5-893/v1', ['Development & Evolution', 'Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry', 'Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology'], [u'Department of Neurological Sciences, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT, USA', u'Neurosciences Unit, UCL Institute of Child Health, London, UK']]
