[u'Instrumented gait assessment with a single wearable: an introductory tutorial', ['Silvia Del Din', 'Aodhan Hickey', 'Cassim Ladha', 'Sam Stuart', 'Alan K. Bourke', 'Patrick Esser', 'Lynn Rochester', 'Alan Godfrey'], u'14 Sep 2016', u'Background: Gait is a powerful tool to identify ageing and track disease progression. Yet, its high resolution measurement via traditional instruments remains restricted to the laboratory or bespoke clinical facilities. The potential for that to change is due to the advances in wearables where the synergy between devices and smart algorithms has provided the potential of \u2018a gait lab on a chip\u2019.\nMethods: Commercially available wearables for gait quantification remain expensive and are restricted to a limited number of characteristics unsuitable for a comprehensive assessment required within intervention or epidemiological studies. However, the increasing demand for low-cost diagnostics has fuelled the shift in how health-related resources are distributed. As such we adopt open platform technology and validated research methodologies to harmonise engineering solutions to satisfy current epidemiological needs.\nResults: We provide an introduction to conduct a routine instrumented gait assessment with a discrete, low-cost, accelerometer-based wearable. We show that the capture and interpretation of raw gait signals with a common scripting language can be straightforward and suitable for use within modern studies. We highlight the best approaches and hope that this will help compliment any analytical tool-kit as part of future cohort assessments.\nConclusions: Deployment of wearables can allow accurate gait assessment in accordance with advocated methods of data collection as there is a strong demand for sensitive outcomes derived from pragmatic tools. This tutorial shows that instrumentation of gait using a single open source wearable is pragmatic due to low-cost and translational analytical methods to derive sensitive outcomes.', u'/articles/5-2323/v1', ['Public Health & Epidemiology', 'Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry'], [u'Institute of Neuroscience, Newcastle University Institute for Ageing, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE4 5PL, UK', u'Department of Neuroscience, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, NO-7491, Norway', u'Department of Sport and Health Sciences, Oxford Brookes University, Oxford, OX3 0BP, UK']]

However, despite the array of well-documented benefits, robust outreach efforts are often absent from communities which stand to benefit the most from these initiatives. Here, we introduce \u201cScience Fiesta,\u201d a graduate student-led outreach initiative which utilizes cultural traditions of South Texas as a vehicle to establish self-sustaining interactions between scientists and their local community. Event assessment surveys indicated that attendees found the event both fun and educational.\xa0 At the same time, graduate students who organized the event and participated in outreach reported that they strengthened a variety of professional skills important for their future careers. More importantly, the event had a substantial positive impact on enthusiasm for science outreach.\xa0 Both public attendees and graduate students reported that they were likely to participate in future science outreach events, even though a majority of both groups had not been previously involved in outreach efforts. Science Fiesta is a model for a highly effective graduate student-led outreach initiative that is capable of 1) improving public scientific literacy, 2) reinforcing graduate education and career development and 3) creating a culture of science engagement within local communities.', u'/articles/5-2319/v1', ['Publishing, Education & Communication'], [u'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, USA', u'Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, USA', u'Radiological Science, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, USA', u'Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, USA', u'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, USA', u'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, USA', u'Geriatrics Division, Gerontology and Palliative Medicine, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, USA', u'Department of Physiology, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, USA', u'Cellular and Structural Biology, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, USA', u'School of Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, USA', u'Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, & Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, USA']]
[u'Case Report: Multiple complications after laparoscopic cholecystectomy with perforation and spilled gallstones', ['Jeanett Klubien', 'Dorte Winther Borgersen', 'Jacob Rosenberg', 'Hans-Christian Pommergaard'], u'14 Sep 2016', u'Introduction\r\nPerforation of the gallbladder is a benign and common complication during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. However, it may result in stone spilling, which potentially can lead to serious postoperative complications.\r\n\xa0\nCase report\r\nA 70-year-old male underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis. The procedure was complicated by perforation of the gallbladder and spilling of gallstones. More than a year after the procedure, the patient developed subcutaneous abscesses containing some of the spilled stones, a computed tomography revealed a complex intraabdominal and intrathoracic fistula with communication from the abdominal cavity to pleura and ultrasonic imaging found a lost gallstone in the thorax. After two years, the patient developed pleural empyema and sepsis secondary to the condition. Presently, the patient awaits surgery for the fistula and empyema.\r\n\xa0\nConclusion\r\nProper care should be taken to avoid stone spilling during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. However, if perforation and stone spilling occur, all visible stones should be removed during the procedure and the complication should be noted in the medical records. Furthermore, the patient should be thoroughly informed. This may help accelerate diagnosis if the patient later suffers from a complication related to lost stones.', u'/articles/5-2322/v1', ['Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases', 'Endocrinology & Gastroenterology'], [u'Center for Perioperative Optimization, Department of Surgery, Herlev Hospital, Herlev, Denmark', u'Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark', u'Department of Surgery, Herlev Hospital, Herlev, Denmark', u'Department of Surgery, Hvidovre Hospital, Hvidore, Denmark']]
