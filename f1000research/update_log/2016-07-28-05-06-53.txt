[u'Characterization of 5-(2-18F-fluoroethoxy)-L-tryptophan for PET imaging of the pancreas', ['Ahmed Abbas', 'Christine Beamish', 'Rebecca McGirr', 'John Demarco', 'Neil Cockburn', 'Dawid Krokowski', 'Ting-Yim Lee', 'Michael Kovacs', 'Maria Hatzoglou', 'Savita Dhanvantari'], u'27 Jul 2016', u'Purpose: In diabetes, pancreatic beta cell mass declines significantly prior to onset of fasting hyperglycemia. This decline may be due to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and the system L amino acid transporter LAT1 may be a biomarker of this process. In this study, we used 5-(2-18F-fluoroethoxy)-L-tryptophan (18F-L-FEHTP) to target LAT1 as a potential biomarker of beta cell function in diabetes.\nProcedures: Uptake of 18F-L-FEHTP was determined in wild-type C57BL/6 mice by ex vivo biodistribution. Both dynamic and static positron emission tomography (PET) images were acquired in wild-type and Akita mice, a model of ER stress-induced diabetes, as well as in mice treated with streptozotocin (STZ). LAT1 expression in both groups of mice was evaluated by immunofluorescence microscopy.\nResults: Uptake of 18F-L-FEHTP was highest in the pancreas, and static PET images showed highly specific pancreatic signal. Time-activity curves showed significantly reduced 18F-L-FEHTP uptake in Akita mice, and LAT1 expression was also reduced. However, mice treated with STZ, in which beta cell mass was reduced by 62%, showed no differences in 18F-L-FEHTP uptake in the pancreas, and there was no significant correlation of 18F-L-FEHTP uptake with beta cell mass.\nConclusions: 18F-L-FEHTP is highly specific for the pancreas with little background uptake in kidney or liver. We were able to detect changes in LAT1 in a mouse model of diabetes, but these changes did not correlate with beta cell function or mass. Therefore, 18F-L-FEHTP PET is not a suitable method for the noninvasive imaging of changes in beta cell function during the progression of diabetes.', u'/articles/5-1851/v1', ['Public Health & Epidemiology', 'Endocrinology & Gastroenterology'], [u'Department of Medical Biophysics, Western University, London, ON, N6A 5C1, Canada', u'Metabolism and Diabetes Program, Lawson Health Research Institute, London, ON, N6A 4V2, Canada', u'Imaging Program, Lawson Health Research Institute, London, ON, N6A 4V2, Canada', u'Department of Genetics and Genome Sciences, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, 44106, USA', u'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Western University, London, ON, N6A 5C1, Canada']]
