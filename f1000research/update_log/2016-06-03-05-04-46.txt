[u'Molecular studies of exercise, skeletal muscle, and ageing', ['James A. Timmons', 'Iain J. Gallagher'], u'02 Jun 2016', u'The purpose of an F1000 review is to reflect on the bigger picture, exploring controversies and new concepts as well as providing opinion as to what is limiting progress in a particular field. We reviewed about 200 titles published in 2015 that included reference to \u2018skeletal muscle, exercise, and ageing\u2019 with the aim of identifying key articles that help progress our understanding or research capacity while identifying methodological issues which represent, in our opinion, major barriers to progress. Loss of neuromuscular function with chronological age impacts on both health and quality of life. We prioritised articles that studied human skeletal muscle within the context of age or exercise and identified new molecular observations that may explain how muscle responds to exercise or age. An important aspect of this short review is perspective: providing a view on the likely \u2018size effect\u2019 of a potential mechanism on physiological capacity or ageing.', u'/articles/5-1087/v1', ['Bone Disorders', 'Public Health & Epidemiology', 'Endocrinology & Gastroenterology', 'Development & Evolution', 'Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry', 'Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Dermatology', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u"Division of Genetics & Molecular Medicine, King's College London, London, UK", u'School of Health Sciences, University of Stirling, Stirling, UK']]
[u'Towards understanding the molecular mechanism of cardiolipin transport in Salmonella typhimurium: interactions between an essential inner membrane protein YejM and its newly found ligand, YejL', ['Uma Gabale', 'Gene Qian', 'Elaina Roach', 'Susanne Ressl'], u'02 Jun 2016', u'Salmonella\xa0typhimurium\xa0is responsible for over 35% of all foodborne illness related hospitalizations in the United States. This Gram-negative bacterium\xa0possesses an inner and an outer membrane (OM), the latter allowing\xa0its survival and replication within host tissues. During infection, OM is remodeled by transport of glycerophospholipids across the periplasm and into the OM. Increased levels of cardiolipin in the OM were observed upon PhoPQ activation and led to the discovery of YejM; an inner membrane protein essential for cell growth involved in cardiolipin binding and transport to the OM. Another protein that might be playing a role in cardiolipin transport is YejL, as its gene is localized upstream of yejm on the same operon. Here we report how YejM was engineered to facilitate crystal growth and X-ray diffraction analysis. Furthermore, we present for the first time that YejL is a ligand for YejM. Successful structure determination of YejM and YejL will help us understand how they interact and how YejM facilitates cardiolipin transport to the OM. Ultimately, yejm, being an essential gene, may lead to new drug targets inhibiting the pathogenic properties of\xa0S. typhimurium.', u'/articles/5-1086/v1', ['Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases'], [u'Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry Department, Indiana University Bloomington, Bloomington, IN, 47405, USA']]
[u'Dynamics of cell polarity in tissue morphogenesis: a comparative view from Drosophila and Ciona', ['Michael T. Veeman', 'Jocelyn A. McDonald'], u'02 Jun 2016', u'Tissues in developing embryos exhibit complex and dynamic rearrangements that shape forming organs, limbs, and body axes. Directed migration, mediolateral intercalation, lumen formation, and other rearrangements influence the topology and topography of developing tissues. These collective cell behaviors are distinct phenomena but all involve the fine-grained control of cell polarity. Here we review recent findings in the dynamics of polarized cell behavior in both the Drosophila ovarian border cells and the Ciona notochord. These studies reveal the remarkable reorganization of cell polarity during organ formation and underscore conserved mechanisms of developmental cell polarity including the Par/atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) and planar cell polarity pathways. These two very different model systems demonstrate important commonalities but also key differences in how cell polarity is controlled in tissue morphogenesis. Together, these systems raise important, broader questions on how the developmental control of cell polarity contributes to morphogenesis of diverse tissues across the metazoa.', u'/articles/5-1084/v1', ['Development & Evolution', 'Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology'], [u'Division of Biology, Kansas State University, Manhattan, Kansas, 66506, USA']]
[u'Multiple statistical tests: lessons from a d20', ['Christopher R. Madan'], u'02 Jun 2016', u"Statistical analyses are often conducted with \u03b1=.05. When multiple statistical tests are conducted, this procedure needs to be adjusted to compensate for the otherwise inflated Type I error. In some instances in tabletop gaming, sometimes it is desired to roll a 20-sided dice (or `d20') twice and take the greater outcome. Here I draw from probability theory and the case of a d20, where the probability of obtaining any specific outcome is 1/20, to determine the probability of obtaining a specific outcome (Type-I error) at least once across repeated, independent statistical tests.", u'/articles/5-1129/v1', ['Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'Department of Psychology, Boston College, Chestnut Hill, MA, 02467, USA']]
