[u'Recent advances in understanding and treating vasculitis', ['Matthew J. Koster', 'Kenneth J. Warrington'], u'20 Jun 2016', u'Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides (AAVs) are near universally fatal conditions if untreated. Although effective therapeutic options are available for these diseases, treatment regimens are associated with both short- and long-term adverse effects. The recent identification of effective B-cell-targeted therapy with an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody has transformed the treatment landscape of AAV. Questions, nevertheless, remain regarding the appropriate timing, dose, frequency, duration, and long-term effects of treatment. The aim of this article is to provide an overview of the current information, recent advances, ongoing clinical trials, and future treatment possibilities in AAV.', u'/articles/5-1436/v1', ['Bone Disorders', 'Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases', 'Oncology & Hematology', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA']]
[u'From reads to genes to pathways: differential expression\xa0analysis of RNA-Seq experiments using Rsubread\xa0and the edgeR quasi-likelihood pipeline', ['Yunshun Chen', 'Aaron T. L. Lun', 'Gordon K. Smyth'], u'20 Jun 2016', u'In recent years, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has become a very widely used technology\xa0for profiling gene expression. One of the most common aims of RNA-seq profiling is\xa0to identify genes or molecular pathways that are differentially expressed (DE) between two\xa0or more biological conditions. This article demonstrates a computational workflow for the\xa0detection of DE genes and pathways from RNA-seq data by providing a complete analysis\xa0of an RNA-seq experiment profiling epithelial cell subsets in the mouse mammary gland.\xa0The workflow uses R software packages from the open-source Bioconductor project and\xa0covers all steps of the analysis pipeline, including alignment of read sequences, data exploration,\xa0differential expression analysis, visualization and pathway analysis. Read alignment\xa0and count quantification is conducted using the Rsubread package and the statistical analyses\xa0are performed using the edgeR package. The differential expression analysis uses the\xa0quasi-likelihood functionality of edgeR.', u'/articles/5-1438/v1', ['Public Health & Epidemiology', 'Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, 3052, Australia', u'Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Victoria, 3010, Australia', u'Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute, University of Cambridge, Li Ka Shing Centre, Cambridge, UK', u'Department of Mathematics and Statistics, The University of Melbourne, Victoria, 3010, Australia']]
[u'Inhibitory system overstimulation plays a role in the pathogenesis of neuromuscular and neurological diseases: a novel hypothesis', ['Bert Tuk'], u'20 Jun 2016', u'Based upon a thorough review of published clinical observations regarding the inhibitory system, I hypothesize that this system may play a key role in the pathogenesis of a variety of neuromuscular and neurological diseases. Specifically, excitatory overstimulation, which is commonly reported in neuromuscular and neurological diseases, may be a homeostatic response to inhibitory overstimulation. Involvement of the inhibitory system in disease pathogenesis is highly relevant, given that most approaches currently being developed for treating neuromuscular and neurological diseases focus on reducing excitatory activity rather than reducing inhibitory activity.', u'/articles/5-1435/v1', ['Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry'], [u'Leiden Academic Center for Drug Research (LACDR), Leiden University, Leiden, 2333 CC, Netherlands', u'Ry Pharma, Hofstraat 1, Willemstad, 4797 AC, Netherlands']]

This makes CIS especially suitable for determining the times, places and rates of DNA synthesis as well as the detection of the fine-scale re-arrangements of DNA and of molecules associated with combed DNA fibers. Here, we show how CIS may be extended to 13C-labeling via the detection and quantification of the 13C14N- recombinant ion and the use of the 13C:12C ratio, we discuss how CIS might permit three successive labels, and we suggest ideas that might be explored using CIS.', u'/articles/5-1437/v1', ['Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'Equipe AMMIS, laboratoire MERCI EA 3829, facult\xe9 des Sciences et Techniques, University of Rouen, Mont-Saint-Aignan Cedex, France', u'Institute of Electronics, Microelectronics and Nanotechnology (IEMN), UMR CNRS 8520, Lille1 University, Villeneuve d\u2019Ascq, France', u'Material Research & Technology Department (MRT), Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology (LIST), Belvaux, Luxembourg', u'Genomic Vision, Bagneux, France', u'iSSB, G\xe9nopole, CNRS, UEVE, Universit\xe9 Paris-Saclay, Evry, France', u'Laboratory Microbiology Signals and Environment EA4312, Department of Biology, University of Rouen, Mont-Saint-Aignan Cedex, France']]
