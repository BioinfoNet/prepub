[u'Health communication, information technology and the public\u2019s attitude toward periodic general health examinations', ['Quan-Hoang Vuong'], u'30 Dec 2016', u'Background: Periodic general health examinations (GHEs) are gradually becoming more popular as they employ subclinical screenings, as a means of early detection. This study considers the effect of information technology (IT), health communications and the public\u2019s attitude towards GHEs in Vietnam. Methods: A total of 2,068 valid observations were obtained from a survey in Hanoi and its surrounding areas. Results: In total, 42.12% of participants stated that they were willing to use IT applications to recognise illness symptoms, and nearly 2/3 of them rated the healthcare quality at average level or below. Discussion: The data, which was processed by the BCL model, showed that IT applications (apps) reduce hesitation toward GHEs; however, older people seem to have less confidence in using these apps. Health communications and government\u2019s subsidy also increased the likelihood of people attending periodic GHEs. The probability of early check-ups where there is a cash subsidy could reach approximately 80%.', u'/articles/5-2935/v1', ['Public Health & Epidemiology'], [u'FPT University, Hanoi, Vietnam']]
[u'Inducible targeting of CNS astrocytes in Aldh1l1-CreERT2 BAC transgenic mice', ['Jan Winchenbach', 'Tim Duking', 'Stefan A. Berghoff', 'Sina K. Stumpf', 'Swen Hulsmann', 'Klaus-Armin Nave', 'Gesine Saher'], u'30 Dec 2016', u'Background: Studying astrocytes in higher brain functions has been hampered by the lack of genetic tools for the efficient expression of inducible Cre recombinase throughout the CNS, including the neocortex. Methods: Therefore, we generated BAC transgenic mice, in which CreERT2 is expressed under control of the Aldh1l1 regulatory region. Results: When crossbred to Cre reporter mice, adult Aldh1l1-CreERT2 mice show efficient gene targeting in astrocytes. No such Cre-mediated recombination was detectable in CNS neurons, oligodendrocytes, and microglia. As expected, Aldh1l1-CreERT2 expression was evident in several peripheral organs, including liver and kidney. Conclusions: Taken together, Aldh1l1-CreERT2 mice are a useful tool for studying astrocytes in neurovascular coupling, brain metabolism, synaptic plasticity and other aspects of neuron-glia interactions.', u'/articles/5-2934/v1', ['Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry'], [u'Department of Neurogenetics, Max Planck Institute of Experimental Medicine, G\xf6ttingen, Germany', u'Clinic for Anesthesiology, Research Group Central Respiratory Control, University Medical Center G\xf6ttingen, Experimental Neuroanesthesiology, G\xf6ttingen, Germany', u'Center Nanoscale Microscopy and Molecular Physiology of the Brain (CNMPB), G\xf6ttingen, Germany']]
