Yashin'], u'01 Feb 2017', u'There exists a set of web-based tools for integration and exploring information linked to annotated genetic variants. We developed haploR, an R-package for querying such web-based genome annotation tools (currently implementing on HaploReg and RegulomeDB) and gathering information in a format suitable for downstream bioinformatic analyses. This will facilitate post-genome wide association studies streamline analysis for rapid discovery and interpretation of genetic associations.', u'/articles/6-97/v1', ['Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'Biodemography of Aging Research Unit (BARU) at Social Science Research Institute, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA', u'Duke Population Research Institute, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA']]
