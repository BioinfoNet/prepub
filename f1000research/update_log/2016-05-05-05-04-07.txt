[u'Case Report:\xa0Filtering the data on IVC filters', ['Hina Khan', 'Usman Jilani'], u'03 May 2016', u'Venous thromboembolic disease is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. First line therapy for thromboembolic disease remains anticoagulation. However, certain populations warrant consideration of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. This case report discusses an example of a patient who presented with an acute pulmonary embolism and highlights the utilization of the inferior vena cava (IVC) filter as patient therapy. Thus, in this case report we will review the indications for IVC filter placement and compare the compliance of IVC filter placement to established guidelines of use.', u'/articles/5-795/v1', ['Cardiopulmonary & Vascular Disorders', 'Oncology & Hematology'], [u'Internal Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA', u'New York Institute of Technology College of Osteopathic Medicine, Long Island, NY, USA']]
[u'The natural defense system and the normative self model', ['Philippe Kourilsky'], u'03 May 2016', u'Infectious agents are not the only agressors, and the immune system is not the sole defender of the organism. In an enlarged perspective, the \u2018normative self model\u2019 postulates that a \u2018natural defense system\u2019 protects man and other complex organisms against the environmental and internal hazards of life, including infections and cancers. It involves multiple error detection and correction mechanisms that confer robustness to the body at all levels of its organization. According to the model, the self relies on a set of physiological norms, and NONself (meaning\xa0: Non Obedient to the Norms of the self) is anything \u2018off-norms\u2019. The natural defense system comprises a set of \u2018civil defenses\u2019 (to which all cells in organs and tissues contribute), and a \u2018professional\xa0army\xa0\u2018, made of a smaller set of mobile cells. Mobile and non mobile cells differ in their tuning abilities. Tuning extends the recognition capabilities of NONself by the mobile cells, which increase their defensive function. To prevent them to drift, which would compromise self/NONself discrimination, the more plastic mobile cells need to periodically refer to the more stable non mobile cells to keep within physiological standards.', u'/articles/5-797/v1', ['Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'Department of Immunology, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France', u'Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Biology, CNRS/UMR 7241 - INSERM U1050, Coll\xe8ge de France, Paris, France']]
