[u'Atypical presentations and treatment variations of pelvic congestion syndrome: A four patient case series', ['David Greuner', 'Andrew Amorosso', 'Arno Rotgans', 'Chris Hollingsworth', 'Adam Tonis'], u'22 Dec 2016', u'This is a retrospective case review of four patients randomly selected from a pool of 43 patients who presented to our practice with historically atypical symptoms for pelvic congestion syndrome, and the treatment they received. These 43 patients were treated between June and December of 2016. Each patient presented with various atypical symptoms including chronic lower back pain, urinary frequency and incontinence, hip pain, tenesmus, and uncontrollable flatulence. Diagnostic abdominal and pelvic duplex ultrasound and fluoroscopic venography was performed on all patients with informed consent. The four selected patients for this study were all positive for pelvic venous reflux, pelvic venous insufficiency and ovarian/gonadal vein reflux and varicosities. All four of the patients selected in this retrospective study were examined at 1 week from date of intervention and again at 1 month from date of intervention. At the 1 week postoperative exam all four patients had experienced significant resolution of their symptoms, although all had residual congestion present on their right side. After re-intervention to treat right sided congestion via the right gonadal vein, at the 1 month postoperative exam all four patients had experienced an almost complete resolution of symptoms.', u'/articles/5-2906/v1', ['Cardiopulmonary & Vascular Disorders'], [u'New York City Surgical Associates Surgical Group, New York, New York, 10022, USA']]
[u'Phylommand - a command line software package for phylogenetics', ['Martin Ryberg'], u'22 Dec 2016', u'Phylogenetics is an intrinsic part of many analyses in evolutionary biology and ecology, and as the amount of data available for these analyses is increasing rapidly the need for automated pipelines to deal with the data also increases. Phylommand is a package of four programs to create, manipulate, and/or analyze phylogenetic trees or pairwise alignments. It is built to be easily implemented in software workflows, both directly on the command prompt, and executed using scripts. Inputs can be taken from standard input or a file, and the behavior of the programs can be changed through switches. By using standard file formats for phylogenetic analyses, such as newick, nexus, phylip, and fasta, phylommand is widely compatible with other software.', u'/articles/5-2903/v1', ['Development & Evolution', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology', 'Plant Biology, Ecology & Environmental Sciences'], [u'Department of Organismal Biology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden']]
[u'Case Report: A giant myopericytoma involving the occipital region of the scalp - a rare entity', ['Sunil Munakomi', 'Pramod Chaudhary'], u'22 Dec 2016', u'Herein we report a rare case of a giant myopericytoma presenting in a 16-year-old girl as a slowly progressive swelling involving the scalp in the occipital region. It was managed by complete excision. Histological examination of the lesion revealed \xa0spindle-shaped cells forming characteristic rosettes around the blood vessels, and positive staining with smooth muscle actin.', u'/articles/5-2905/v1', ['Dermatology'], [u'Department of Neurosurgery, College of Medical Sciences, Chitwan, Nepal']]
