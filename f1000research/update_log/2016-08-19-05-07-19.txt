George', 'Katja R. Turner'], u'18 Aug 2016', u'Complications resulting from the delayed clinical presentation of a left main coronary artery obstruction can be catastrophic. This case report presents a 73-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis who underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement with a core valve who, approximately 20 minutes after heparin reversal with protamine, became hypotensive and was unresponsive to vasopressor and inotropic therapy. Transesophageal echocardiography demonstrated global hypokinesis, which was highly consistent with the occlusion of the left main coronary artery. Angiography confirmed this diagnosis and demonstrated that valve positioning had not changed compared to post-placement examination. Here we report the partial covering of the ostium of the left main coronary artery by a core valve skirt that converted into a total occlusion following the initiation of heparin reversal with protamine and the value of multimodal imaging in the management of this case.', u'/articles/5-2032/v1', ['Cardiopulmonary & Vascular Disorders', 'Critical Care & Emergency Medicine'], [u'Department of Anesthesiology, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, USA', u'Department of Surgery,Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, USA', u'Department of Cardiology, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, USA']]

Most clinical research has used some form of questionnaires to capture data but none has been critically evaluated particularly with respect to its end-user feasibility and utility.\n\nObjective: To critically appraise a clinical data collection questionnaire for PCD used in a large national PCD consortium in order to apply conclusions in future PCD research.\n\nMethods: We describe the development, validation and revision process of a clinical questionnaire for PCD and its evaluation during a national clinical PCD study with respect to data collection and analysis, initial completion rates and user feedback.\n\nResults: 14 centers participating in the consortium successfully completed the revised version of the questionnaire for 173 patients with various completion rates for various items. While content and internal consistency analysis demonstrated validity, there were methodological deficiencies impacting completion rates and end-user utility. These deficiencies were addressed resulting in a more valid questionnaire.\n\nConclusions: Our experience may be useful for future clinical research in PCD. Based on the feedback collected on the questionnaire through analysis of completion rates, judgmental analysis of the content, and feedback from experts and end users, we suggest a practicable framework for development of similar tools for various future PCD research.', u'/articles/5-2031/v1', ['Public Health & Epidemiology', 'Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases'], [u'Department of Pediatrics, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada', u'Department of Pediatrics, Ziv Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, Bar Ilan University, Safed, Israel', u'Department of Occupational Therapy, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada', u"Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel, Tel Aviv, Israel", u'The Edith Wolfson Medical Center, Tel Aviv University, Holon, Israel', u'Soroka Medical Center, Beer Shiva, Israel', u'Rambam Medical Center, Haifa, Israel', u'Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Centers, Jerusalem, Israel', u'Galilee Medical Center, Naharia, Bar Ilan Faculty of Medicine, Safed, Israel', u'Assaf Harofeh Medical Center, Zerifin, Israel', u'Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel', u'Carmel Medical Center, Haifa, Israel', u'Sheba Medical Center , Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel', u'St Vincent Hospital, Nazaret, Israel', u'Dana Children\u2019s Hospital, Tel Aviv, Israel', u'Department of General Pediatrics, University Children\u2019s Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany']]
