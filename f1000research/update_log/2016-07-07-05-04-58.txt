[u'A multi-site cutting device implements efficiently the divide-and-conquer strategy in tumor sampling', ['Jose I. Lopez', 'Jesus M. Cortes'], u'06 Jul 2016', u'We recently showed that in order to detect intra-tumor heterogeneity a Divide-and-Conquer (DAC) strategy of tumor sampling outperforms current routine protocols. This paper is a continuation of this work, but here we focus on DAC implementation in the Pathology Laboratory. In particular, we describe a new simple method that makes use of a cutting grid device and is applied to clear cell renal cell carcinomas for DAC implementation. This method assures a thorough sampling of large surgical specimens, facilitates the demonstration of intratumor heterogeneity, and saves time to pathologists in the daily practice. The method involves the following steps: 1. Thin slicing of the tumor (by hand or machine), 2. Application of a cutting grid to the slices (e.g., a French fry cutter), resulting in multiple tissue cubes with fixed position within the slice, 3. Selection of tissue cubes for analysis, and finally, 4. Inclusion of selected cubes into a cassette for histological processing (with about eight tissue fragments within each cassette). Thus, using our approach in a 10 cm in-diameter-tumor we generate 80 tumor tissue fragments placed in 10 cassettes and, notably, in a tenth of time. Eighty samples obtained across all the regions of the tumor will assure a much higher performance in detecting intratumor heterogeneity, as proved recently with synthetic data.', u'/articles/5-1587/v1', ['Public Health & Epidemiology', 'Oncology & Hematology', 'Urology, Gynecology & Obstetrics'], [u'Department of Pathology, Cruces University Hospital, Barakaldo, Spain', u'Biomarkers in Cancer Unit, Biocruces Research Institute, Barakaldo, Spain', u'University of the Basque Country, Leioa, Spain', u'Quantitative Biomedicine Unit, Biocruces Research Institute, Barakaldo, Spain', u'Ikerbasque: The Basque Foundation for Science, Bilbao, Spain', u'Department of Cell Biology and Histology, University of the Basque Country, Leioa, Spain']]

[u'Emerging concepts for PI3K/mTOR inhibition as a potential treatment for osteosarcoma', ['Michael W. Bishop', 'Katherine A. Janeway'], u'06 Jul 2016', u'Patients with metastatic and recurrent osteosarcoma fare poorly, and new therapeutic strategies are needed to improve survival. Several recent complementary genomic and pathway analyses of both murine and human osteosarcoma have revealed common aberrations of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in osteosarcoma. Preclinical data demonstrate that inhibition of PI3K and mTOR with either a combination of single agents or dual inhibiting compounds can decrease cell proliferation and induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. With a lack of available clinical agents active in osteosarcoma, PI3K/mTOR inhibition represents a potential vulnerability in osteosarcoma that warrants clinical investigation.', u'/articles/5-1590/v1', ['Oncology & Hematology', 'Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u"Department of Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA", u'Department of Pediatrics, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN, USA', u"Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Boston, MA, USA"]]
[u'Adolescent Klinefelter syndrome: is there an advantage to testis tissue harvesting or not?', ['Robert Oates'], u'06 Jul 2016', u'It is currently unclear whether an adolescent with 47,XXY Klinefelter syndrome will be better off having testicular sperm extraction (TESE) performed in an effort to \u2018preserve fertility\u2019 for the future or, alternatively, should be advised to simply wait until adulthood when he and his partner are ready to begin a family. This report will provide data suggesting that there is no obvious \u2018preservation\u2019 benefit and that recommending TESE to the 47,XXY boy and his parents may not be as helpful as it might appear and may be overly aggressive.', u'/articles/5-1595/v1', ['Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Urology, Gynecology & Obstetrics'], [u'Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA']]
