[u'Creating, generating and comparing random network models with Network Randomizer', ['Gabriele Tosadori', 'Ivan Bestvina', 'Fausto Spoto', 'Carlo Laudanna', 'Giovanni Scardoni'], u'17 Oct 2016', u'Biological networks are becoming a fundamental tool for the investigation of high-throughput\xa0data in several fields of biology and biotechnology. With the increasing amount of information,\xa0network-based models are gaining more and more interest and new techniques are required\xa0in order to mine the information and to validate the results. We have developed an app for the\xa0Cytoscape platform which allows the creation of randomized networks and the randomization\xa0of existing, real networks. Since there is a lack of tools for generating and randomizing\xa0networks, our app helps researchers to exploit different, well known random network models\xa0which could be used as a benchmark for validating real datasets. We also propose a novel\r\nmethodology for creating random weighted networks starting from experimental data. Finally\xa0the app provides a statistical tool which compares real versus random attributes, in order\xa0to validate all the numerical findings. In summary, our app aims at creating a standardised\xa0methodology for the validation of the results in the context of the Cytoscape platform.', u'/articles/5-2524/v1', ['Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'Department of Computer Science, University of Verona, Verona, 37134, Italy', u'Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb, Zagreb, 10000, Croatia', u'Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Verona, 37134, Italy', u'Center for BioMedical Computing, University of Verona, Verona, 37134, Italy']]
