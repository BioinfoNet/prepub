[u'The PathLinker app: Connect the dots in protein interaction networks', ['Daniel P. Gil', 'Jeffrey N. Law', 'T. M. Murali'], u'20 Jan 2017', u'PathLinker is a graph-theoretic algorithm for reconstructing the interactions in a signaling pathway of interest. It efficiently computes multiple short paths within a background protein interaction network from the receptors to transcription factors (TFs) in a pathway. We originally developed PathLinker to complement manual curation of signaling pathways, which is slow and painstaking. The method can be used in general to connect any set of sources to any set of targets in an interaction network. The app presented here makes the PathLinker functionality available to Cytoscape users. We present an example where we used PathLinker to compute and analyze the network of interactions connecting proteins that are perturbed by the drug lovastatin.', u'/articles/6-58/v1', ['Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'Department of Computer Science, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, USA', u'Genetics, Bioinformatics, and Computational Biology, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, USA', u'ICTAS Center for Systems Biology of Engineered Tissues, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, USA']]
