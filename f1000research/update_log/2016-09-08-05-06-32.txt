[u'Deep brain stimulation in Gilles de la Tourette syndrome: killing several birds with one stone?', ['Andreas Hartmann'], u'07 Sep 2016', u'In patients with severe, treatment-refractory Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (GTS), deep brain stimulation (DBS) of various targets has been increasingly explored over the past 15 years. The multiplicity of surgical targets is intriguing and may be partly due to the complexity of GTS, specifically the various and frequent associated psychiatric comorbidities in this disorder. Thus, the target choice may not only be aimed at reducing tics but also comorbidities. While this approach is laudable, it also carries the risk to increase confounding factors in DBS trials and patient evaluation. Moreover, I question whether DBS should really be expected to alleviate multiple symptoms at a time. Rather, I argue that tic reduction should remain our primary objective in severe GTS patients and that this intervention may subsequently allow an improved psychotherapeutic and/or pharmacological treatment of comorbidities. Thus, I consider DBS in GTS not as a single solution for all our patients\u2019 ailments but as a stepping stone to improved holistic care made possible by tic reduction.', u'/articles/5-2255/v1', ['Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry'], [u'Sorbonne Universit\xe9s, UPMC Univ Paris 06, UMR S 1127, CNRS UMR 7225, Paris, France', u'Assistance Publique-H\xf4pitaux de Paris, Department of Neurology, Groupe Hospitalier Piti\xe9-Salp\xeatri\xe8re, Paris, France', u'French Reference Centre for Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome, Groupe Hospitalier Piti\xe9-Salp\xeatri\xe8re, Paris, France']]
