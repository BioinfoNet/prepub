[u'A real-world intention-to-treat analysis of a decade\u2019s experience of treatment of hepatitis C with interferon-based therapies', ['Nowlan Selvapatt', 'Ashley Brown'], u'24 Aug 2016', u'Objectives: To assess the uptake of pegylated interferon (PegIFN) plus ribavirin (RBV)-based regimens in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) in a large, single-centre, real-world setting over 10 years.\nMethods: This was a single centre, retrospective analysis of data from patients who attended their first appointment for treatment of HCV genotype 1\u20133 between 2003 and 2013. Patients were stratified by HCV genotype. The total number of patients who attended their first appointment, incidence of patients who did not proceed to treatment and associated reasons, and incidence of patients treated were analysed. Sustained virological response (SVR) rates were also reported for all patient populations.\nResults: Overall, 1,132 patients attended their first appointment; 47.8% were included in the genotype 1 group (genotype 1a: 22.2%, genotype 1b: 13.3%, genotype 1 other: 12.3%), 7.7% in the genotype 2 group and 44.5% in the genotype 3 group. A greater proportion of patients received treatment versus those who did not receive treatment (84.4% vs 15.6%, respectively). Reasons for declining treatment included: patient declined treatment with PegIFN plus RBV: 35.0%, medical contraindications: 20.3% and mental health-related contraindications: 13.6%. An SVR was achieved in 52.6% of patients who attended their first appointment and 62.3% of patients who received treatment.\nConclusions: Approximately half of the patients included in this study achieved an SVR. A noteworthy proportion of patients did not receive treatment due to a reluctance to receive PegIFN plus RBV or contraindications to therapy. Results suggest an ongoing need for improvement in the treatment uptake and overall outcomes \u2013 particularly for genotype 2 and 3 patients for whom availability of interferon-free regimens is limited. The introduction of more tolerable direct-acting antiviral regimes may help overcome barriers to uptake demonstrated within this cohort.', u'/articles/5-2061/v1', ['Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases'], [u'Liver and Antiviral Unit, Imperial College NHS Trust Liver Unit, St Mary\u2019s Hospital, London, W2 1NY, UK', u'Department of Hepatology, Imperial College, St Mary\u2019s Hospital, London, W2 1NY, UK']]
