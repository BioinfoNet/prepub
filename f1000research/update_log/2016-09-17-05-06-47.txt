Aerts', 'John Quackenbush', 'Benjamin Haibe-Kains'], u'16 Sep 2016', u'In 2013, we published a comparative analysis mutation and gene expression profiles and drug sensitivity measurements for 15 drugs characterized in the 471 cancer cell lines screened in the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE). While we found good concordance in gene expression profiles, there was substantial inconsistency in the drug responses reported by the GDSC and CCLE projects. We received extensive feedback on the comparisons that we performed. This feedback, along with the release of new data, prompted us to revisit our initial analysis. Here we present a new analysis using these expanded data in which we address the most significant suggestions for improvements on our published analysis \u2014 that targeted therapies and broad cytotoxic drugs should have been treated differently in assessing consistency, that consistency of both molecular profiles and drug sensitivity measurements should both be compared across cell lines, and that the software analysis tools we provided should have been easier to run, particularly as the GDSC and CCLE released additional data.\r\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\r\nOur re-analysis supports our previous finding that gene expression data are significantly more consistent than drug sensitivity measurements. The use of new statistics to assess data consistency allowed us to identify two broad effect drugs and three targeted drugs with moderate to good consistency in drug sensitivity data between GDSC and CCLE. For three other targeted drugs, there were not enough sensitive cell lines to assess the consistency of the pharmacological profiles. We found evidence of inconsistencies in pharmacological phenotypes for the remaining eight drugs.\r\n\xa0\r\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Overall, our findings suggest that the drug sensitivity data in GDSC and CCLE continue to present challenges for robust biomarker discovery. This re-analysis provides additional support for the argument that experimental standardization and validation of pharmacogenomic response will be necessary to advance the broad use of large pharmacogenomic screens.', u'/articles/5-2333/v1', ['Public Health & Epidemiology', 'Oncology & Hematology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, M5G 1L7, Canada', u'Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, M5G 1L7, Canada', u'Institut de Recherches Cliniques de Montr\xe9al, Montr\xe9al, H2W 1R7, Canada', u'Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, M5G 1X8, Canada', u'Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, M5S 2E4, Canada', u'University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, UK', u'Section of Medical Oncology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, 06520, USA', u'Yale Cancer Center, Yale University, New Haven, CT, 06510, USA', u'Fudan University, Shanghai City, 200135, China', u'University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, 72205, USA', u'Department of Pathology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02215, USA', u'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, 02215, USA', u'Department of Radiation Oncology and Radiology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02215, USA', u'Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology and Center for Cancer Computational Biology, Boston, MA, 02215, USA', u'Ontario Institute of Cancer Research, Toronto, M5G 1L7, Canada']]
[u'mouseTube \u2013 a database to collaboratively unravel mouse ultrasonic communication', ['Nicolas Torquet', 'Fabrice de Chaumont', 'Philippe Faure', 'Thomas Bourgeron', 'Elodie Ey'], u'16 Sep 2016', u'Ultrasonic vocalisation is a broadly used proxy to evaluate social communication in mouse models of neuropsychiatric disorders. The efficacy and robustness of testing these models suffer from limited knowledge of the structure and functions of these vocalisations as well as of the way to analyse the data. We created mouseTube, an open database with a web interface, to facilitate sharing and comparison of ultrasonic vocalisations data and metadata attached to a recording file. Metadata describe 1) the acquisition procedure, e.g., hardware, software, sampling frequency, bit depth; 2) the biological protocol used to elicit ultrasonic vocalisations; 3) the characteristics of the individual emitting ultrasonic vocalisations (e.g., strain, sex, age). To promote open science and enable reproducibility, data are made freely available. The website provides searching functions to facilitate the retrieval of recording files of interest. It is designed to enable comparisons of ultrasonic vocalisation emission between strains, protocols or laboratories, as well as to test different analysis algorithms and to search for protocols established to elicit mouse ultrasonic vocalisations. Over the long term, users will be able to download and compare different analysis results for each data file. Such application will boost the knowledge on mouse ultrasonic communication and stimulate sharing and comparison of automatic analysis methods to refine phenotyping techniques in mouse models of neuropsychiatric disorders.', u'/articles/5-2332/v1', ['Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'Universit\xe9 Pierre et Marie Curie Paris 06, CNRS UMR 8246, INSERM U1130, Institut de Biologie Paris-Seine (IBPS), Sorbonne Universit\xe9s, Paris, 75005, France', u'Bio Image Analysis, CNRS URA 2582, Institut Pasteur, Paris, 75015, France', u'Human Genetics and Cognitive Functions, CNRS UMR 3571 Genes, Synapses and Cognition, University Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cit\xe9, Institut Pasteur, Paris, 75015, France']]
