[u'The challenges with the validation of research antibodies', ['Jan L.A. Voskuil'], u'17 Feb 2017', u'This article further discusses the reproducibility crisis in biomedical science and how poor conduct of commercial antibodies contribute to this. In addition, the way quality data are presented on product sheets by antibody vendors is scrutinized. The article proposes that there is a distinction between testing data and validation data, and special attention is asked for consistency between batches and aliquots. Moreover, the article separates the specifics, such as formulation, antigen and price, from the specifics on performance. Finally, a two-tier approach is discussed, enabling scientists to anticipate how an antibody is likely to perform when repeated purchases are required.', u'/articles/6-161/v1', ['Public Health & Epidemiology'], [u'Aeonian Biotech, Marcham, OX13 6PH, UK']]
[u'Surgical education and adult learning: Integrating theory into practice', ['Prem Rashid'], u'14 Feb 2017', u'Surgical education continues to evolve from the master-apprentice model. Newer methods of the process need to be used to manage the dual challenges of educating while providing safe surgical care. This requires integrating adult learning concepts into delivery of practical training and education in busy clinical environments. A narrative review aimed at outlining and integrating adult learning and surgical education theory was undertaken. Additionally, this information was used to relate the practical delivery of surgical training and education in day-to-day surgical practice. Concepts were sourced from reference material. Additional material was found using a PubMed search of the words: \u2018surgical education theory\u2019 and \u2018adult learning theory medical\u2019. This yielded 1351 abstracts, of which 43 articles with a focus on key concepts in adult education theory were used. Key papers were used to formulate structure and additional cross-referenced papers were included where appropriate. Current concepts within adult learning have a lot to offer when considering how to better deliver surgical education and training. Better integration of adult learning theory can be fruitful. Individual teaching surgical units need to rethink their paradigms and consider how each individual can contribute to the education experience. Up skilling courses for trainers can do much to improve the delivery of surgical education. Understanding adult learning concepts and integrating these into day-to-day teaching can be valuable.', u'/articles/6-143/v1', ['Publishing, Education & Communication', 'Critical Care & Emergency Medicine'], [u'Department of Urology, Port Macquarie Base Hospital, Rural Clinical School, The University of New South Wales, Port Macquarie, NSW, 2444, Australia']]
[u'Web-based questionnaires: Lessons learned from practical implementation of a pharmacoepidemiological study', ['Raissa Candido', 'Edson Perini', 'Cristiane Menezes de Padua', 'Daniela Junqueira'], u'13 Feb 2017', u'Web-based questionnaires may offer advantages over traditional methods of data collection, including a less administrative workload and reduced respondent burden. However, the implementation of this mode of data collection carries other challenges and may demand more technical expertise to be designed and delivered. Here, we use the preliminary data from a survey developed to estimate the prevalence of methylphenidate use for cognitive enhancement among undergraduate and graduate students, to share the lessons we learned while implementing this online mode of data collection. We show that surveys using a web-based questionnaire should be carried out by a multidisciplinary team with support from Information Science specialists. Limitations to access these resources or budget constraints may demand a considerable effort to assure the success of the survey. Web-questionnaires are usually described as easy to use and economically encouraging. Therefore, we believe our experience, and the lessons we learned, may be a relevant resource for researchers from general backgrounds intending to undertake their first web-questionnaire.', u'/articles/6-135/v1', ['Publishing, Education & Communication'], [u'Centro de Estudos do Medicamentos (Cemed), Departmento de Farm\xe1cia Social, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG), Belo Horizonte, Brazil']]
[u'Insights for conducting real-time focus groups online using a web conferencing service', ['James Kite', 'Philayrath Phongsavan'], u'09 Feb 2017', u'Background\r\nOnline focus groups have been increasing in use over the last 2 decades, including in biomedical and health-related research. However, most of this research has made use of text-based services such as email, discussion boards, and chat rooms, which do not replicate the experience of face-to-face focus groups. Web conferencing services have the potential to more closely match the face-to-face focus group experience, including important visual and aural cues. This paper provides critical reflections on using a web conferencing service to conduct online focus groups.\n\nMethods\r\nAs part of a broader study, we conducted both online and face-to-face focus groups with participants. The online groups were conducted in real-time using the web conferencing service, Blackboard CollaborateTM. We used reflective practice to assess how the conduct and content of the groups were similar and how they differed across the two platforms.\n\nResults\r\nWe found that further research using such services is warranted, particularly when working with hard-to-reach or geographically dispersed populations. The level of discussion and the quality of the data obtained was similar to that found in face-to-face groups. However, some issues remain, particularly in relation to managing technical issues experienced by participants and ensuring adequate recording quality to facilitate transcription and analysis.\n\nConclusions\r\nOur experience with using web conferencing for online focus groups suggests that they have the potential to offer a realistic and comparable alternative to face-to-face focus groups, especially for geographically dispersed populations such as rural and remote health practitioners. Further testing of these services is warranted but researchers should carefully consider the service they use to minimise the impact of technical difficulties.', u'/articles/6-122/v1', ['Publishing, Education & Communication'], [u'Prevention Research Collaboration, Sydney School of Public Health and Charles Perkins Centre, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia']]
[u'Monitoring disease activity and severity in lupus', ['Abidullah Khan', 'Iqbal Haider', 'Maimoona Ayub', 'Salman Khan'], u'10 Feb 2017', u'Background: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a relatively uncommon disease of young females in Pakistan. Usually, it has a relapsing-remitting course with variable severity and disease activity. Amongst the different clinical and laboratory parameters used to monitor disease activity in lupus, mean platelet volume (MPV) is a novel biomarker. Although MPV has been studied in other rheumatological conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, its role in adult SLE needs to be defined, especially in Pakistan.\xa0Methods: The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of MPV as a biomarker of disease activity in SLE. This study included 25 patients with active SLE, and another 25 participants with stable, inactive lupus. MPV was measured in each group and compared using SPSS version 16. MPV was also correlated with SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Independent sample t-test and Pearson\u2019s correlation tests were applied. Sensitivity and specificity of MPV were checked through ROC analysis.\xa0Results: The MPV of patients with active SLE (n=25, mean [M]=7.12, SD=1.01) was numerically lower than those in the inactive-SLE group (n=25, M= 10.12, SD=0.97), and this was statistically significant (P<0.001). MPV had an inverse relationship with both ESR (r=-0.93, P<0.001) and SLEDAI (r= -0.94, P<0.001). However, there was a strong positive correlation between ESR and SLEDAI (r=0.95, P<0.001). For MPV, a cutoff value of less than 8.5fl had a sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 100% (P< 0.001).\xa0Conclusions: Higher disease activity in SLE is associated with a correspondingly low MPV.', u'/articles/6-126/v1', ['Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases'], [u'Department of Medicine, Khyber Teaching Hospital, Peshawar, 25000, Pakistan']]

[u'Cell growth inhibition and apoptotic effects of a specific anti-RTFscFv antibody on prostate cancer, but not glioblastoma, cells', ['Foroogh Nejatollahi', 'Payam Bayat', 'Bahareh Moazen'], u'17 Feb 2017', u'Background: Single chain antibody (scFv) has shown interesting results in cancer immunotargeting approaches, due to its advantages over monoclonal antibodies. Regeneration and tolerance factor (RTF) is one of the most important regulators of extracellular and intracellular pH in eukaryotic cells. In this study, the inhibitory effects of a specific anti-RTF scFv were investigated and compared between three types of prostate cancer and two types of glioblastoma cells.\xa0Methods: A phage antibody display library of scFv was used to select specific scFvs against RTF using panning process. The reactivity of a selected scFv was assessed by phage ELISA. The anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects of the antibody on prostate cancer (PC-3, Du-145 and LNCaP) and glioblastoma (U-87 MG and A-172) cell lines were investigated by MTT and Annexin V/PI assays.\xa0Results: A specific scFv with frequency 35% was selected against RTF epitope. This significantly inhibited the proliferation of the prostate cells after 24 h. The percentages of cell viability (using 1000 scFv/cell) were 52, 61 and 73% for PC-3, Du-145 and LNCaP cells, respectively, compared to untreated cells. The antibody (1000 scFv/cell) induced apoptosis at 50, 40 and 25% in PC-3, Du-145 and LNCaP cells, respectively. No growth inhibition and apoptotic induction was detected for U-87 and A172 glioblastoma cells.\xa0Conclusions: Anti-RTFscFv significantly reduced the proliferation of the prostate cancer cells. The inhibition of cell growth and apoptotic induction effects in PC-3 cells were greater than Du-145 and LNCaP cells. This might be due to higher expression of RTF antigen in PC-3 cells and/or better accessibility of RTF to scFv antibody. The resistance of glioblastoma cells to anti-RTF scFv offers the existence of mechanism(s) that abrogate the inhibitory effect(s) of the antibody to RTF. The results suggest that the selected anti-RTF scFv antibody could be an effective new alternative for prostate cancer immunotherapy.', u'/articles/6-156/v1', ['Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology'], [u'Shiraz HIV/AIDS research center, Institute of Health, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran', u'Recombinant Antibody Laboratory, Department of Immunology, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran']]

So, the response of rice roots are to be phenotyped under varied drip irrigation treatments.\xa0Methods: This study describes an investigation on rice root phenotyping under drip irrigation treatments in split-split plot design. Two lateral spacing levels (0.8 and 1.2m), two depths of irrigation (5-10 and 15-20 cm) by solar powered and well operated irrigation were tested using TNRH 180, JKRH 3333 and ADT(R)45 rice genotypes during the summer season (2013 & 2014) in Coimbatore, India. Conventional aerobic irrigation was considered as control.\xa0Results and Discussion: An increased root length, root density (length and weight), root Adinosine Tri Phosphotase enzyme activity, root volume and filled grain percentage were favored in aerobic rice under the conditions of 0.8m lateral distance with 5-10cm depth of sub surface drip irrigation (SDI). Improved root characteristics were observed in JKRH 3333 rice hybrid, and root density and thickness favored the filled grains and yield increment in rice by drip irrigation.

[u'Neuraxial opioids as analgesia in labour and postoperative after caesarean section and hysterectomy: A questionnaire survey in Sweden', ['Anette Hein', 'Caroline Gillis-Haegerstrand', 'Jan G. Jakobsson'], u'13 Feb 2017', u'Background: Neuraxial opioids improve labour analgesia and analgesia after caesarean section (CS) and hysterectomy. Undesirable side effects and difficulties in arranging postoperative monitoring might influence the use of these opioids. The aim of the present survey was to assess the use of intrathecal and epidural morphine in gynaecology and obstetrics in Sweden. Methods: A questionnaire was sent to 47 anaesthesiologists at obstetric units in Sweden concerning the use and postoperative monitoring of morphine, sufentanil and fentanyl in spinal/epidural anaesthesia. Results: A total of 32 units responded representing 83% of annual CS in Sweden. In CS spinal anaesthesia, 20/32 units use intrathecal morphine, the most common dose of which was 100 \u03bcg (17/21). Intrathecal fentanyl (10-20 \u03bcg) was used by 21 units and sufentanil (2.5 -10 \u03bcg) by 9/32 of the responding units. In CS epidural anaesthesia, epidural fentanyl (50-100 \u03bcg) or sufentanil (5-25 \u03bcg) were commonly used (25/32), and 12/32 clinics used epidural morphine, the majority of units used a 2 mg dose. Intrathecal morphine for hysterectomy was used by 20/30 units, with 200 \u03bcg as the most common dose (9/32). Postoperative monitoring was organized in adherence to the National Guidelines; the patient is in postoperative care or an obstetrical ward over 2-6 hours and up-to 12 hours in an ordinary surgical ward. Risk of respiratory depression/difficult to monitor was a reason for not using intrathecal opioids. Conclusions: Neuraxial morphine is used widely in Sweden in CS and hysterectomy, but is still restricted in some units because of the concern for respiratory depression and difficulties in monitoring.', u'/articles/6-133/v1', ['Urology, Gynecology & Obstetrics'], [u'Department of Anaesthesia & Intensive Care, Danderyds Hospital, Stockholm, 182 88, Sweden']]
