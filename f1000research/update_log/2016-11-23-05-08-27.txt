Weidenauer', 'Stefan Kastl', 'Christoph Kaun', 'Aniko Posa', 'Inna Sabdyusheva Litschauer', 'Johannes Winkler', 'Mariann Gyongyosi'], u'22 Nov 2016', u'Background. Mobilization of bone marrow-origin CD34+ cells was investigated 3 days (3d) after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with/without ischemic preconditioning (IP) in relation to stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1\u03b1)/ chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) axis, to search for possible mechanisms behind insufficient cardiac repair in the first days post-AMI.\xa0Methods. Closed-chest reperfused AMI was performed by percutaneous balloon occlusion of the mid-left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery for 90min, followed by reperfusion in pigs. Animals were randomized to receive either IP initiated by 3x5min cycles of re-occlusion/re-flow prior to AMI (n=6) or control AMI (n=12). Blood samples were collected at baseline, 3d post-AMI, and at 1-month follow-up to analyse chemokines and mobilized CD34+ cells. To investigate the effect of acute hypoxia, SDF-1\u03b1 and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 in vitro were assessed, and a migration assay of CD34+ cells toward cardiomyocytes was performed.\xa0Results. Reperfused AMI induced significant mobilisation of CD34+ cells (baseline: 260\xb175 vs. 3d: 668\xb1180; P<0.001) and secretion of MMP-2 (baseline: 291.83\xb153.40 vs. 3d: 369.64\xb172.89; P=0.011) into plasma, without affecting the SDF-1\u03b1 concentration. IP led to the inhibition of MMP-2 (IP: 165.67\xb147.99 vs. AMI: 369.64\xb172.89; P=0.004) 3d post-AMI, accompanied by increased release of SDF-1\u03b1 (baseline: 23.80\xb112.36 vs. 3d: 45.29\xb111.31; P=0.05) and CXCR4 (baseline: 0.59\xb10.16 vs. 3d: 2.06\xb11.42; P=0.034), with a parallel higher level of mobilisation of CD34+ cells (IP: 881\xb1126 vs. AMI: 668\xb1180; P=0.026), compared to non-conditioned AMI. In vitro, CD34+ cell migration toward cardiomyocytes was enhanced by SDF-1\u03b1, which was completely abolished by 90min hypoxia and co-incubation with MMP-2.\xa0Conclusions. Non-conditioned AMI induces MMP-2 release, hampering the ischemia-induced increase in SDF-1\u03b1 and CXCR4 by cleaving the SDF-1\u03b1/CXCR4 axis, with diminished mobilization of the angiogenic CD34+ cells.

[u'Communicating behavioral genetics: Charting the limits of the genetic interpolation effect', ['Alexandre Morin-Chasse'], u'22 Nov 2016', u'Background: Scientific research has linked genetic predispositions to complex social behaviors and orientations. Recent empirical work in science communication suggests that the dissemination of these research findings can impact on public beliefs about the influence of genetics. The genetic interpolation hypothesis posits that exposure to this type of news causes the public to update their views about the influence of genetics on human beings and to infer greater genetic causation for other social traits that are not mentioned in the news content. The main purpose of this study is to test whether the genetic interpolation effect also emerges following exposure to a soft treatment: a short summary paragraph rather than a real news article. It also tests if specifying that a particular gene has a marginal effect succeeds at moderating the genetic interpolation effect. Finally, the study tests a counter-hypothesis: instead of resulting from belief updating, the genetic interpolation effect is triggered by the simple act of thinking about genetics shortly before reporting beliefs. Methods: In total, 2080 respondents were recruited from a pre-existing online panel and were randomly split into four experimental groups: group 1) no message; group 2) a paragraph about how genes can impact on voting behavior; group 3) the same paragraph as group 2, plus an indication that the effect of a particular gene is small; group 4) a paragraph about how genetics impact on physical traits such as eye color. Subjects were then asked to evaluate the role of genetics in causing three traits: voting at election; intelligence; and natural hair style (curly or straight). Results: The analyses reveal no evidence supporting the genetic interpolation hypothesis, the moderation hypothesis or the counter-hypothesis. Conclusion: Overall, the results suggest that exposure to a paragraph describing how genes can impact on complex social behavior is not sufficient to trigger the genetic interpolation effect.', u'/articles/5-2744/v1', ['Publishing, Education & Communication', 'Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry'], [u'Universit\xe9 de Montr\xe9al, Montr\xe9al, Canada']]
[u'Peripheral refraction with different designs of progressive soft contact lenses in myopes', ['Kareem Allinjawi', 'Sharanjeet Kaur', 'Saadah Mohamed  Akhir', 'Haliza Abdul Mutalib'], u'22 Nov 2016', u'Aim: The purpose of this study was to compare the changes in relative peripheral refractive error produced by two different designs of progressive soft contact lenses in myopic schoolchildren.\nMethods: Twenty-seven myopic schoolchildren age between 13 to 15 years were included in this study. The measurements of central and peripheral refraction were made using a Grand-Seiko WR-5100K open-field autorefractometer without correction (baseline), and two different designs of progressive contact lenses (PCLs) (Multistage from SEED & Proclear from Cooper Vision) with an addition power of +1.50 D. Refractive power was measured at center and at eccentricities between 35\xba temporal to 35\xba nasal visual field (in 5\xba steps).\nResults: Both PCLs showed a reduction in hyperopic defocus at periphery. However, this reduction was only significant for the Multistage PCL (p= 0.015), (Proclear PCL p= 0.830).\xa0\nConclusion: Multistage PCLs showed greater reduction in peripheral retinal hyperopic defocus among myopic schoolchildren in comparison to Proclear PCLs.', u'/articles/5-2742/v1', ['Eye Disorders & ENT'], [u'Optometry and Vision Science, Faculty of Health Science, University Kebangsaan Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia']]
[u'Differentially correlated genes in co-expression networks control phenotype transitions', ['Lina D. Thomas', 'Dariia Vyshenska', 'Natalia Shulzhenko', 'Anatoly Yambartsev', 'Andrey Morgun'], u'22 Nov 2016', u'Background: Co-expression networks are a tool widely used for analysis of \u201cBig Data\u201d in biology that can range from transcriptomes to proteomes, metabolomes and more recently even microbiomes. Several methods were proposed to answer biological questions interrogating these networks. Differential co-expression analysis is a recent approach that measures how gene interactions change when a biological system transitions from one state to another. Although the importance of differentially co-expressed genes to identify dysregulated pathways has been noted, their role in gene regulation is not well studied. Herein we investigated differentially co-expressed genes in a relatively simple mono-causal process (B lymphocyte deficiency) and in a complex multi-causal system (cervical cancer).\r\nMethods: Co-expression networks of B cell deficiency (Control and BcKO) were reconstructed using Pearson correlation coefficient for two mus musculus datasets: B10.A strain (12 normal, 12 BcKO) and BALB/c strain (10 normal, 10 BcKO). Co-expression networks of cervical cancer (normal and cancer) were reconstructed using local partial correlation method for five datasets (total of 64 normal, 148 cancer). Differentially correlated pairs were identified along with the location of their genes in BcKO and in cancer networks. Minimum Shortest Path and Bi-partite Betweenness Centrality where statistically evaluated for differentially co-expressed genes in corresponding networks.\xa0 \xa0\r\nResults: We show that in B cell deficiency the differentially co-expressed genes are highly enriched with immunoglobulin genes (causal genes). In cancer we found that differentially co-expressed genes act as \u201cbottlenecks\u201d rather than causal drivers with most flows that come from the key driver genes to the peripheral genes passing through differentially co-expressed genes. Using in vitro knockdown experiments for two out of 14 differentially co-expressed genes found in cervical cancer (FGFR2 and CACYBP), we showed that they play regulatory roles in cancer cell growth.\r\nConclusion: Identifying differentially co-expressed genes in co-expression networks is an important tool in detecting regulatory genes involved in alterations of phenotype.', u'/articles/5-2740/v1', ['Oncology & Hematology', 'Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology', 'Urology, Gynecology & Obstetrics'], [u'Instituto de Matem\xe1tica e Estat\xedstica, Universidade de S\xe3o Paulo, S\xe3o Paulo, Brazil', u'College of Pharmacy, Oregon State University, Corvallis, USA', u'College of Veterinary Medicine, Oregon State University, Corvallis, USA']]
[u'Disambiguate: An open-source application for disambiguating two species in next generation sequencing data from grafted samples', ['Miika J. Ahdesmaki', 'Simon R. Gray', 'Justin H. Johnson', 'Zhongwu Lai'], u'22 Nov 2016', u'Grafting of cell lines and primary tumours is a crucial step in the drug development process between cell line studies and clinical trials. Disambiguate is a program for computationally separating the sequencing reads of two species derived from grafted samples. Disambiguate operates on alignments to the two species and separates the components at very high sensitivity and specificity as illustrated in artificially mixed human-mouse samples. This allows for maximum recovery of data from target tumours for more accurate variant calling and gene expression quantification. Given that no general use open source algorithm accessible to the bioinformatics community exists for the purposes of separating the two species data, the proposed Disambiguate tool presents a novel approach and improvement to performing sequence analysis of grafted samples. Both Python and C++ implementations are available and they are integrated into several open and closed source pipelines.
