[u'Finger stick blood collection for gene expression profiling and storage of tempus blood RNA tubes', ['Darawan Rinchai', 'Esperanza Anguiano', 'Phuong Nguyen', 'Damien Chaussabel'], u'15 Jun 2016', u'With this report we aim to make available a standard operating procedure (SOP) developed for RNA stabilization of small blood volumes collected via a finger stick. The anticipation that this procedure may be improved through peer-review and/or readers public comments is another element motivating the publication of this SOP. Procuring blood samples from human subjects can, among other uses, enable assessment of the immune status of an individual subject via the profiling of RNA abundance using technologies such as real time PCR, NanoString, microarrays or RNA-sequencing. It is often desirable to minimize blood volumes and employ methods that are the least invasive and can be practically implemented outside of clinical settings. Finger-stick blood samples are increasingly used for measurement of levels of pharmacological drugs and biological analytes. It is a simple and convenient procedure amenable for instance to field use or self-collection at home using a blood sample collection kit. Such methodologies should also enable the procurement of blood samples at high frequency for health or disease monitoring applications.', u'/articles/5-1385/v1', ['Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology'], [u'Systems Biology Department, Sidra Medical and Research Center, Doha, Qatar', u'The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine, Farmington, USA', u'Baylor Scott and White Health, Dallas, USA']]
[u'An end to end workflow for differential gene expression using Affymetrix microarrays', ['Bernd Klaus'], u'15 Jun 2016', u'In this article, we walk through an end\u2013to\u2013end Affymetrix microarray differential expression workflow using Bioconductor packages. This workflow is directly applicable to current \u201cGene\u201d type arrays, e.g. the HuGene or MoGene arrays but can easily adapted to similar platforms. The data re\u2013analyzed is a typical clinical microarray data set that compares inflammed and non\u2013inflammed colon tissue in two disease subtypes. We will start from the raw data CEL files, show how to import them into a Bioconductor ExpressionSet, perform quality control and normalization and finally differential gene expression (DE) analysis, followed by some enrichment analysis. As experimental designs can be complex, a self contained introduction to linear models is also part of the workflow.', u'/articles/5-1384/v1', ['Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'EMBL Heidelberg, Heidelberg, 69117, Germany']]
