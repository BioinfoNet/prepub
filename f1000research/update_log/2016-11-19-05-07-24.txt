In 2013, the National Health Security Office of Thailand introduced P4P, based on the UK Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF), as a mandatory programme for primary care providers. This study aims to review the first year of the Thai QOF policy, focusing on the key features of its formulation and implementation stages.\xa0Methods.This study used a mix of data collection approaches, such as literature review, in-depth interviews with QOF managers, and focus-group discussions with health officers and practitioners. Data were collected between June and August 2015 and transcribed and analysed using qualitative content analysis (interpretation of the content of text data through the systematic classification process of identifying themes or patterns). Two consultation meetings were organised to verify the preliminary findings.\xa0Results.\xa0Based on the UK model, the Thai QOF was formulated without formal consultation with key stakeholders. Additionally, programme managers adopted a \u2018learning by doing\u2019 approach, since Thai authorities were already aware of health system limitations, such as insufficient human and financial resources and unreliable databases. There were also problems with QOF implementation, as follows: 1) deducting the budget from the annual payment for ambulatory care made the policy unjustified because providers did not receive full subsidisation of their service delivery; 2) lack of key stakeholder engagement resulted in miscommunication, and subsequently misunderstanding and inadequate coordination, for the translation of QOF policy into action; and 3) the unreliability of the IT system led to inaccurately-reported data on service delivery, thereby adversely affecting performance.\xa0Conclusion.There is still room for improvement in formulating and implementing the Thai QOF programme. Policy makers and programme implementers at both the national and international levels can benefit from this study for ensuring effective policy transfer and implementation of future QOF programmes.', u'/articles/5-2700/v1', ['Public Health & Epidemiology'], [u'Health Intervention and Technology Assessment Program, Ministry of Public Health, Thailand, Nonthaburi, Thailand', u'Institute of Global Health Innovation, Imperial College London, London, UK', u'University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK']]
[u'Dimension reduction of Malaria Box data allows efficient compound prioritization', ['Gajinder Pal Singh'], u'18 Nov 2016', u'Background: New anti-malarial drugs are needed to meet the challenge of artemisinin resistance and to achieve malaria elimination and eradication. The new anti-malarial compounds are expected to have many desirable properties, such as activity against multiple stages of Plasmodium, low host cytotoxicity, and low propensity for resistance development, but whether and how these properties might be linked to each other is not clear. A better understanding of the relationship between activities of compounds against different stages of Plasmodium could help in the development of strategies to prioritize compounds with maximum potential for further development.\xa0Methods: We utilized the large amount of data that has recently been generated on 400 anti-malarial Malaria Box compounds and performed statistical analyses, such as rank correlation, hierarchical clustering, and principal-component analyses, to test associations between activities against different stages of Plasmodium, other pathogens, and human cells.\xa0Results: We found significant positive correlations between the activities of compounds against different stages of Plasmodium. Our results also show toxicity associated with assays conducted at higher compound concentrations. Principal-component analyses (PCA) of the data allowed differentiation of Plasmodium-specific activity from general toxicity and predicted success in in vitro evolution of resistance. We found that a single principal-component can capture most of the desirable properties of Malaria Box compounds and can be used to rank compounds from most desirable to least desirable activity-profile.\xa0Conclusions: Here, we provide a systematic strategy to prioritize Malaria Box compounds for further development. This approach may be applied for prioritization of anti-malarial compounds in general.', u'/articles/5-2701/v1', ['Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'Molecular Medicine Group, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB), New Delhi, India']]
