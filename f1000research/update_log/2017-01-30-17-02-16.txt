[u'Seven perspectives on GPCR H/D-exchange proteomics methods', ['Xi Zhang'], u'30 Jan 2017', u'Recent research shows surging interest to visualize human G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) dynamic structures using the bottom-up H/D-exchange (HDX) proteomics technology. This opinion article clarifies critical technical nuances and logical thinking behind the GPCR HDX proteomics method, to help scientists overcome cross-discipline pitfalls, and understand and reproduce the protocol at high quality. The 2010 89% HDX structural coverage of GPCR was achieved with both structural and analytical rigor. This article emphasizes systematically considering membrane protein structure stability and compatibility with chromatography and mass spectrometry (MS) throughout the pipeline, including the effects of metal ions, zero-detergent shock, and freeze-thaws on HDX result rigor. This article proposes to view bottom-up HDX as two steps to guide choices of detergent buffers and chromatography settings: (I) protein HDX labeling in native buffers, and (II) peptide-centric analysis of HDX labels, which applies (a) bottom-up MS/MS to construct peptide matrix and (b) HDX MS to locate and quantify H/D labels. The detergent-low-TCEP digestion method demystified the challenge of HDX-grade GPCR digestion. GPCR HDX proteomics is a structural approach, thus its choice of experimental conditions should let structure lead and digestion follow, not the opposite.', u'/articles/6-89/v1', ['Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'Independent Researcher, Montreal, QC, H2Y 1H3, Canada']]
