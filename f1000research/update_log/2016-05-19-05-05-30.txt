[u'Upper extremity nerve block: how can benefit, duration, and safety be improved? An update', ['Metha Brattwall', 'Pether Jildenstal', 'Margareta Warren Stomberg', 'Jan G. Jakobsson'], u'18 May 2016', u'Upper extremity blocks are useful as both sole anaesthesia and/or a supplement to general anaesthesia and they further provide effective postoperative analgesia, reducing the need for opioid analgesics. There is without doubt a renewed interest among anaesthesiologists in the interscalene, supraclavicular, infraclavicular, and axillary plexus blocks with the increasing use of ultrasound guidance. The ultrasound-guided technique visualising the needle tip and solution injected reduces the risk of side effects, accidental intravascular injection, and possibly also trauma to surrounding tissues. The ultrasound technique has also reduced the volume needed in order to gain effective block. Still, single-shot plexus block, although it produces effective anaesthesia, has a limited duration of postoperative analgesia and a number of adjuncts have been tested in order to prolong analgesia duration. The addition of steroids, midazolam, clonidine, dexmedetomidine, and buprenorphine has been studied, all being off-label when administered by perineural injection, and the potential neurotoxicity needs further study. The use of perineural catheters is an effective option to improve and prolong the postoperative analgesic effect.\r\nUpper extremity plexus blocks have an obvious place as a sole anaesthetic technique or as a powerful complement to general anaesthesia, reducing the need for analgesics and hypnotics intraoperatively, and provide effective early postoperative pain relief. Continuous perineural infusion is an effective option to prolong the effects and improve postoperative quality.', u'/articles/5-907/v1', ['Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry', 'Critical Care & Emergency Medicine', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'Department of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care, Unit of Day Surgery, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, G\xf6teborg, Sweden', u'Institute of Health and Care Sciences, The Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden', u'Department of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care, \xd6rebro University Hospital, \xd6rebro, Sweden', u'Department of Anaesthesia & Intensive Care, Institution for Clinical Science, Karolinska Institute, Danderyds University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden']]
