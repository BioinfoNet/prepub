[u'IncucyteDRC: An R package for the dose response analysis of live cell imaging data', ['Philip J. Chapman', 'Dominic I. James', 'Amanda J. Watson', 'Gemma V. Hopkins', 'Ian D. Waddell', 'Donald J. Ogilvie'], u'23 May 2016', u'We present IncucyteDRC, an R package for the analysis of data from live cell imaging cell proliferation experiments carried out on the Essen Biosciences IncuCyte ZOOM instrument. The package provides a simple workflow for summarising data into a form that can be used to calculate dose response curves and EC50 values for small molecule inhibitors. Data from different cell lines, or cell lines grown under different conditions, can be normalised as to their doubling time. A simple graphical web interface, implemented using shiny, is provided for the benefit of non-R users. The software is potentially useful to any research group studying the impact of small molecule inhibitors on cell proliferation using the IncuCyte ZOOM.', u'/articles/5-962/v1', ['Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'Drug Discovery Unit, Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, Manchester, UK']]
