[u'What does the UK public want from academic science communication?', ['James Redfern', 'Sam Illingworth', 'Joanna Verran'], u'07 Jun 2016', u'The overall aim of public academic science communication\xa0is to engage a non-scientist with a particular field of science and/or research topic, often driven by the expertise of the academic. An e-survey was designed to provide insight into respondent\u2019s current and future engagement with science communication activities. Respondents provided a wide range of ideas and concerns as to the \u2018common practice\u2019 of academic science communication, and whilst they support some of these popular approaches (such as open-door events and science festivals), there are alternatives that may enable wider engagement. Suggestions of internet-based approaches and digital media were strongly encouraged, and although respondents found merits in methods such as science festivals, limitations such as geography, time and topic of interest were a barrier to engagement for some. Academics and scientists need to think carefully about how they plan their science communication activities and carry out evaluations, including considering the point of view of the public, as although defaulting to hands-on open door events at their university may seem like the expected standard, it may not be the best way to reach the intended audience.', u'/articles/5-1261/v1', ['Publishing, Education & Communication'], [u'School of Healthcare Science, Manchester Metropolitan University, Manchester, UK', u'School of Research, Enterprise & Innovation, Manchester Metropolitan University, Manchester, UK']]
[u'Decomposition of mutational context signatures using quadratic programming methods', ['Andy G. Lynch'], u'07 Jun 2016', u'Methods for inferring signatures of mutational contexts from large cancer sequencing data sets are invaluable for biological research, but impractical for clinical application where we require tools that decompose the context data for an individual into signatures. One such method has recently been published using an iterative linear modelling approach. A natural alternative places the problem within a quadratic programming framework and is presented here, where it is seen to offer advantages of speed and accuracy.', u'/articles/5-1253/v1', ['Eye Disorders & ENT', 'Oncology & Hematology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK']]
