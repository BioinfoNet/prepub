[u'Evaluation of the Postoperative Quality of Recovery Scale test and re-test in Swedish among healthy volunteers', ['Pether Jildenstal', 'Johan Eriksson', 'Margareta Warren Stomberg', 'Jan G. Jakobsson'], u'21 Oct 2016', u'Introduction \r\nPatient outcome measures are required to assess the quality of healthcare. Tools for a patients\u2019 self-assessment of quality of recovery, during perioperative care, have been developed during the last decade. The Postoperative Quality of Recovery Scale (PostopQRS) questionnaire is one of the most well-accepted and validated tools available. Here we assess the PostopORS questionnaire in Swedish.\nMethods\r\nSixty-one students from the Bachelor Program in Nursing, (50 female and 11 male; mean age, 25; range, 21-46) filled in the Swedish translation of the PostopQRS questionnaire twice. They also evaluated whether they found the queries easy to understand and respond to. \nResults\r\nThe participants found the Swedish translation of the PostopQRS questionnaire easy to read and understand. There were minor differences in test responses between the initial test and the re-test 48 hours later. We found that the PostopQRS questionnaire has some background noise; 12 out of 61 participants (20%) reported mild pain, 25 (41%) scored some depression and 33 scored mild anxiety (54%). The cognitive domain showed a learning effect between tests in \u201cword recall\u201d and \u201cword generation\u201d, while \u201cdigit recall forward\u201d and \u201cdigit recall backward\u201d showed no change. We found a difference in cognitive test performance with age; younger participants had higher mean cognitive test scores compared to participants >30 years. Overall, nine participants showed a decrease in re-test scores; two experienced a mild increase in pain; one experienced a mild increase in anxiety; and six performed more poorly on cognitive tests.\nConclusion\r\nThe Swedish translation of the PostopQRS was found to be adequate for use in the assessment of quality of recovery, and the questions were well understood by participants. Our study shows the importance of baseline testing for assessment of recovery, since recovery is assessed as a return to or improvement in each individual\u2019s baseline score.', u'/articles/5-2549/v1', ['Public Health & Epidemiology'], [u'Institute of Health and Care Sciences, The Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden', u'Department of Anaesthesiology, Surgery and Intensive Care, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, \xd6rebro, Sweden', u'Department of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care, \xd6rebro University Hospital, \xd6rebro, Sweden', u'Department of Anaesthesiology, Queen Silvia Children\xb4s Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden', u'Institution for Clinical Science, Karolinska Institute,, Danderyds University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden']]
