[u'Better than we thought? The diagnostic performance of an influenza point-of-care test in children, a Bayesian re-analysis', ['Joseph Lee'], u'18 Jan 2017', u'Background: Point-of-care tests (POCTs) for influenza have been criticised for their diagnostic accuracy, with clinical use limited by low sensitivity. These criticisms are based on diagnostic-accuracy studies that often use the questionable assumption of an infallible gold standard. Bayesian latent class modelling can estimate diagnostic performance without this assumption.\xa0Methods: Data extracted from published diagnostic-accuracy studies comparing the QuickVue\xae influenza A+B influenza POCT to reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in two different populations were re-analysed. Classical and Bayesian latent class methods were applied using the Modelling for Infectious diseases CEntre (MICE) web-based application.\xa0Results:\xa0Under classical analyses the estimated sensitivity and specificity of the QuickVue\xae were 66.9% (95% confidence interval (CI) 61.4-71.9) and 97.8% (95% CI 95.7-98.9), respectively. Bayesian latent class models estimated sensitivity of 97.8% (95% credible interval (CrI) 82.1-100) and specificity of 98.5% (95% CrI 96.5-100).\xa0Conclusions: Data from studies comparing the QuickVue\xae point-of-care test to RT-PCR are compatible with better diagnostic performance than previously reported.', u'/articles/6-53/v1', ['Public Health & Epidemiology', 'Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases'], [u'Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, Radcliffe Observatory Quarter, Oxford, UK']]
[u'The Dockstore: enabling modular, community-focused sharing of Docker-based genomics tools and workflows', ["Brian D. O'Connor", 'Denis Yuen', 'Vincent Chung', 'Andrew G. Duncan', 'Xiang Kun Liu', 'Janice Patricia', 'Benedict Paten', 'Lincoln Stein', 'Vincent Ferretti'], u'18 Jan 2017', u'As genomic datasets continue to grow, the feasibility of downloading data to a local organization and running analysis on a traditional compute environment is becoming increasingly problematic. Current large-scale projects, such as the ICGC PanCancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG), the Data Platform for the U.S. Precision Medicine Initiative, and the NIH Big Data to Knowledge Center for Translational Genomics, are using cloud-based infrastructure to both host and perform analysis across large data sets. In PCAWG, over 5,800 whole human genomes were aligned and variant called across 14 cloud and HPC environments; the processed data was then made available on the cloud for further analysis and sharing. If run locally, an operation at this scale would have monopolized a typical academic data centre for many months, and would have presented major challenges for data storage and distribution. However, this scale is increasingly typical for genomics projects and necessitates a rethink of how analytical tools are packaged and moved to the data. For PCAWG, we embraced the use of highly portable Docker images for encapsulating and sharing complex alignment and variant calling workflows across highly variable environments. While successful, this endeavor revealed a limitation in Docker containers, namely the lack of a standardized way to describe and execute the tools encapsulated inside the container. As a result, we created the Dockstore (https://dockstore.org), a project that brings together Docker images with standardized, machine-readable ways of describing and running the tools contained within. This service greatly improves the sharing and reuse of genomics tools and promotes interoperability with similar projects through emerging web service standards developed by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH).', u'/articles/6-52/v1', ['Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute, University of California, Santa Cruz, CA, USA', u'Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, MaRS Centre, Toronto, Canada']]
