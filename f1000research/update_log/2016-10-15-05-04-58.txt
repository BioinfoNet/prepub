Evaluation of the WHO/ISH cardiovascular risk charts and their use is a key priority and since they only exist in paper or PDF formats, we developed a simple R implementation of the charts for all epidemiological subregions of the world. The main strengths of this implementation are that it is built in a free, open-source, coding language with simple syntax, can be modified by the user, and can be used with a standard computer.', u'/articles/5-2522/v1', ['Public Health & Epidemiology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK']]
[u'Zika antiviral chemotherapy: identification of drugs and promising starting points for drug discovery from an FDA-approved library', ['Bruno S. Pascoalino', 'Gilles Courtemanche', 'Marli T. Cordeiro', 'Laura H. V. G. Gil', 'Lucio Freitas-Junior'], u'14 Oct 2016', u'Background\r\nThe recent epidemics of Zika virus (ZIKV) implicated it as the cause of serious and potentially lethal congenital conditions such microcephaly and other central nervous system defects, as well as the development of the Guillain-Barr\xe9 syndrome in otherwise healthy patients. Recent findings showed that anti-Dengue antibodies are capable of amplifying ZIKV infection by a mechanism similar to antibody-dependent enhancement, increasing the severity of the disease. This scenario becomes potentially catastrophic when the global burden of Dengue and the advent of the newly approved anti-Dengue vaccines in the near future are taken into account. Thus, antiviral chemotherapy should be pursued as a priority strategy to control the spread of the virus and prevent the complications associated with Zika.\nMethods\r\nHere we describe a fast and reliable cell-based, high-content screening assay for discovery of anti-ZIKV compounds. This methodology has been used to screen the National Institute of Health Clinical Collection compound library, a small collection of FDA-approved drugs.\nResults and conclusion\r\nFrom 725 FDA-approved compounds triaged, 29 (4%) were found to have anti-Zika virus activity, of which 22 had confirmed (76% of confirmation) by dose-response curves. Five candidates presented selective activity against ZIKV infection and replication in a human cell line. These hits have abroad spectrum of chemotypes and therapeutic uses, offering valuable opportunities for selection of leads for antiviral drug discovery.', u'/articles/5-2523/v1', ['Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'Laborat\xf3rio Nacional de Bioci\xeancias, Centro Nacional de Pesquisa em Energia e Materiais, Campinas-SP, 10000, Brazil', u'BIOASTER, Paris, 75015, France', u'Centro de Pesquisas Aggeu Magalh\xe3es, Funda\xe7\xe3o Oswaldo Cruz -Fiocruz, Recife/PE, Brazil', u'Present Address: Instituto Butantan, S\xe3o Paulo-SP, 1500, Brazil']]

Here, using exome sequencing of paired tissue samples, we show that the normal human brain harbors somatic single base variations measuring up to 0.48% of the total variations. Interestingly, about 64% of these somatic variations in the brain are expected to lead to non-synonymous changes, and as much as 87% of these represent G:C>T:A transversion events. Further, the transversion events in the brain were mostly found in the frontal cortex, whereas the corpus callosum from the same individuals harbors the reference genotype. We found a significantly higher amount of 8-OHdG (oxidative stress marker) in the frontal cortex compared to the corpus callosum of the same subjects (p<0.01), correlating with the higher G:C>T:A transversions in the cortex. We found significant enrichment for axon guidance and related pathways for genes harbouring somatic variations. This could represent either a directed selection of genetic variations in these pathways or increased susceptibility of some loci towards oxidative stress. This study highlights that oxidative stress possibly influence single nucleotide somatic variations in normal human brain.', u'/articles/5-2520/v1', ['Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry', 'Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology'], [u'Genomics & Molceular Medicine Unit, CSIR-Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology, Delhi, 110020, India', u'Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research, CSIR-Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology (AcSIR-IGIB), Delhi, 110020, India', u'CSIR Ayurgenomics Unit- TRISUTRA, CSIR-Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology, Delhi, 110020, India', u'Molecular Immunogenetics Unit, CSIR-Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology, Delhi, 110020, India']]
