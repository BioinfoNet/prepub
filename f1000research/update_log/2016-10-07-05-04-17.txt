[u'Complete analysis of the H5 hemagglutinin and N8 neuraminidase phylogenetic trees reveals that the H5N8 subtype has been produced by multiple reassortment events', ['Andrew R. Dalby'], u'06 Oct 2016', u'The analysis of the complete H5 hemagglutinin and H8 neuraminidase phylogenetic trees presented in this paper shows that the H5N8 avian influenza has been generated by multiple reassortment events. The H5N8 strain does not have a single origin and is produced when the H5 hemagglutinin and N8 neuraminidase re-assort from other H5 and N8 containing strains.\xa0While it was known that there had been a re-assortment to incorporate the Guangdong H5 hemagglutinin at the start of the Korean outbreak, the results show that there have also been multiple reassortment events amongst the non-Korean sequences.', u'/articles/5-2463/v1', ['Public Health & Epidemiology', 'Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases', 'Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Westminster, Westminster, W1W 6UW, UK']]

BOSC has been run since 2000 as a two-day Special Interest Group (SIG) before the annual ISMB conference. The 17th annual BOSC (http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/BOSC_2016) took place in Orlando, Florida in July 2016. As in previous years, the conference was preceded by a two-day collaborative coding event open to the bioinformatics community. The conference brought together nearly 100 bioinformatics researchers, developers and users of open source software to interact and share ideas about standards, bioinformatics software development, and open and reproducible science.', u'/articles/5-2464/v1', ['Publishing, Education & Communication', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, 94720, USA', u'The James Hutton Institute, Dundee, DD2 5DA, UK', u'Bioinformatics Core, Harvard T.H.
