[u'The prevalence and clinical significance of anemia in patients hospitalized with acute heart failure', ['Attila Frigy', 'Zoltan Fogarasi', 'Ildiko Kocsis', 'Lehel Mathe', 'Elod Nagy'], u'26 May 2016', u'Abstract\r\nIn a cohort of patients hospitalized with acute heart failure (AHF) the prevalence of anemia and the existence of a correlation between anemia and the severity of the clinical picture were assessed.\nMethods. 50 consecutive patients (34 men, 16 women, mean age 67.5 years) hospitalized with AHF were enrolled.\xa0 Statistical analysis was performed using a chi-square test, for studying univariate correlation between anemia and the presence of diverse parameters reflecting the severity and prognosis of AHF (\u03b1=0.05).\nResults. 21 patients (14 men, 7 women, mean age 69.6 years), representing 42%, had anemia (Hb<12 g/dl) at admission. Comparing patients with and without anemia there were no significant differences regarding age,\xa0 gender, \xa0presence of atrial fibrillation (p=0.75), diabetes (p=1), ischemic heart disease (p=0.9), ejection fraction < 35% (p=1), hypotension at admission (p=0.34), tachycardia>100 b/min at admission (p=0.75), creatinine level >1.5mg% (p=0.12), and need of high dose of loop diuretic >80 mg/day (p=0.23).\nConclusions. Anemia is a frequent finding in patients hospitalized with AHF. The presence of anemia was not correlated with other factors related to AHF severity and prognosis. This fact suggests its independent role in influencing the clinical picture and prognosis.', u'/articles/5-1006/v1', ['Cardiopulmonary & Vascular Disorders', 'Oncology & Hematology', 'Critical Care & Emergency Medicine'], [u'Department of Internal Medicine IV, University of Medicine and Pharmacy T\xeergu-Mures, T\xe2rgu Mure\u0219, Romania', u'Deptartment of Pharmaceutical Biochemistry, University of Medicine and Pharmacy T\xeergu-Mures, T\xe2rgu Mure\u0219, Romania']]
[u'Identification of selective inhibitors of RET and comparison with current clinical candidates through development and validation of a robust screening cascade', ['Amanda J. Watson', 'Gemma V.

Waddell', 'Bohdan Waszkowycz', 'Donald J. Ogilvie'], u'26 May 2016', u'RET (REarranged during Transfection) is a receptor tyrosine kinase, which plays pivotal roles in regulating cell survival, differentiation, proliferation, migration and chemotaxis. Activation of RET is a mechanism of oncogenesis in medullary thyroid carcinomas where both germline and sporadic activating somatic mutations are prevalent.\r\n\xa0\r\nAt present, there are no known specific RET inhibitors in clinical development, although many potent inhibitors of RET have been opportunistically identified through selectivity profiling of compounds initially designed to target other tyrosine kinases. Vandetanib and cabozantinib, both multi-kinase inhibitors with RET activity, are approved for use in medullary thyroid carcinoma, but additional pharmacological activities, most notably inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor - VEGFR2 (KDR), lead to dose-limiting toxicity. The recent identification of RET fusions present in ~1% of lung adenocarcinoma patients has renewed interest in the identification and development of more selective RET inhibitors lacking the toxicities associated with the current treatments.\r\n\xa0\r\nIn an earlier publication [Newton et al, 2016; 1] we reported the discovery of a series of 2-substituted phenol quinazolines as potent and selective RET kinase inhibitors. Here we describe the development of the robust screening cascade which allowed the identification and advancement of this chemical series. \xa0Furthermore we have profiled a panel of RET-active clinical compounds both to validate the cascade and to confirm that none display a RET-selective target profile.', u'/articles/5-1005/v1', ['Public Health & Epidemiology', 'Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, Drug Discovery Unit, University of Manchester, Manchester, M20 4BX, UK']]
[u'Targeting the latent reservoir to achieve functional HIV cure', ['Daniele C. Cary', 'B. Matija Peterlin'], u'26 May 2016', u'While highly active anti-retroviral therapy has greatly improved the lives of HIV-infected individuals, current treatments are unable to completely eradicate the virus. This is due to the presence of HIV latently infected cells which harbor transcriptionally silent HIV. Latent HIV does not replicate or produce viral proteins, thereby preventing efficient targeting by anti-retroviral drugs. Strategies to target the HIV latent reservoir include viral reactivation, enhancing host defense mechanisms, keeping latent HIV silent, and using gene therapy techniques to knock out or reactivate latent HIV. While research into each of these areas has yielded promising results, currently no one mechanism eradicates latent HIV. Instead, combinations of these approaches should be considered for a potential HIV functional cure.', u'/articles/5-1009/v1', ['Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases', 'Oncology & Hematology', 'Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'Departments of Medicine, Microbiology and Immunology, University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA']]
[u'Members of the genus Burkholderia: good and bad guys', ['Leo Eberl', 'Peter Vandamme'], u'26 May 2016', u'In the 1990s several biocontrol agents on that contained Burkholderia strains were registered by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). After risk assessment these products were withdrawn from the market and a moratorium was placed on the registration of Burkholderia-containing products, as these strains may pose a risk to human health. However, over the past few years the number of novel Burkholderia species that exhibit plant-beneficial properties and are normally not isolated from infected patients has increased tremendously. In this commentary we wish to summarize recent efforts that aim at discerning pathogenic from beneficial Burkholderia strains.', u'/articles/5-1007/v1', ['Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases', 'Development & Evolution', 'Plant Biology, Ecology & Environmental Sciences'], [u'Department of Plant and Microbial Biology, University Z\xfcrich, Zurich, CH-8008, Switzerland', u'Laboratory of Microbiology, Ghent University, Ledeganckstraat 35, B-9000 Gent, Belgium']]

[u'Non-ionotropic signaling by the NMDA receptor: controversy and opportunity', ['John A. Gray', 'Karen Zito', 'Johannes W. Hell'], u'26 May 2016', u'Provocative emerging evidence suggests that the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor can signal in the absence of ion flux through the receptor. This non-ionotropic signaling is thought to be due to agonist-induced conformational changes in the receptor, independently of channel opening. Non-ionotropic NMDA receptor signaling has been proposed to be sufficient to induce synaptic long-term depression (LTD), directly challenging the decades-old model that prolonged low-level calcium influx is required to induce LTD. Here, we briefly review these recent findings, focusing primarily on the potential role of non-ionotropic signaling in NMDA receptor-mediated LTD. Further reports concerning additional roles of non-ionotropic NMDA receptor signaling are also discussed. If validated, this new view of NMDA receptor-mediated signaling will usher in an exciting new era of exploring synapse function and dysfunction.', u'/articles/5-1010/v1', ['Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry', 'Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology'], [u'Center for Neuroscience, University of California, Davis, CA, USA', u'Department of Neurology, University of California, Davis, CA, USA', u'Department of Neurobiology, Physiology & Behavior, University of California, Davis, CA, USA', u'Department of Pharmacology, University of California, Davis, CA, USA']]
