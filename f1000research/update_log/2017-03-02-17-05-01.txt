[u'Cause and age-related mortality trends in Bangladesh (2000-2008)', ['Aziza Sultana Rosy Sarkar', 'Nurul Islam', 'Aminul Hoque'], u'02 Mar 2017', u'Background\r\nThe purpose of this study was to analyze mortality trends in Bangladesh from 2000 to 2008, to identify the main causes of death, and categorize them by sex and age group.\nMethods\r\nThis study used vital registration, maternal and child health data collected from Matlab, a rural area of Bangladesh, in 2000, 2004 and 2008.The data were collected and published by Health and Demographic Surveillance System of ICDDR, B.\nResults\r\nThis study indicates a downward trend in communicable disease, neonatal and maternal, injury and miscellaneous mortality. Only non-communicable diseases (NCDs) revealed an uprising trend for both males and females. Among the NCDs, circulatory system related diseases were most common in Bangladesh. The second major cause of death was neoplasm. The risk of deaths from non-communicable diseases increased with age. The overall death rates were higher for males than females. Males of ages 45 and above were greatly affected by circulatory system related diseases and neoplasm. Circulatory system related deaths were highest (34.01%) in the 70-79 age group. Neoplasm related deaths were highest (34.38%) in the 60-69 age group. Similar patterns were observed for females. Circulatory system related diseases, respiratory related diseases and neoplasms greatly affected females of the 45-59 and above age group. The highest percentage (38.65%) of circulatory system related deaths was found in the 70-79 age group; neoplasm related deaths were highest (29.41%) in the 45-49 age group; and the highest percentage (32.69%) of respiratory related diseases was found in the 60-69 age group.\nConclusions\r\nIt was observed that a large portion of the population died because of non-communicable diseases. Public awareness about common NCDs and the risk factors involved should be raised. Promoting health-related content both in male and female education can bring improvements in reducing NCDs.', u'/articles/6-210/v1', ['Public Health & Epidemiology'], [u'Department of Statistics, Faculty of Science, Rajshahi College, National University, Rajshahi, Bangladesh', u'Department of Statistics, Faculty of Science, University of Rajshahi, Rajshahi, Bangladesh']]
[u'Engaging bioscientists in science communication: Evidence from an international survey', ['Andrea Boggio', 'Giorgio Scita', 'Carmen Sorrentino', 'David Hemenway', 'Andrea Ballabeni'], u'02 Mar 2017', u"Background: Exchanges between scientists and nonscientists are critical to realizing the social value of basic research. These exchanges rest in part on the willingness and ability of scientists to engage effectively in science communication activities. In this paper, we discuss the perception and willingness of basic scientists in the biological and biomedical fields to engage in science outreach. Methods: The analysis is based on qualitative data collected as part of a survey on the social value of basic research and is framed by the theory of planned behavior. This is a well-established theory of human behavior that relies on the premise that a person\u2019s intention to engage in a behavior is the single best predictor of whether that person will in fact engage in that behavior. Results: Our data show that, while bioscientists maintain a positive attitude towards science communication, their intentions are influenced by some negative feelings with regard to how nonscientists react to science communication efforts. Interactions with institutional actors, governmental bodies and the public are particularly problematic. On the other hand, interactions with clinicians and patients are framed in positive terms. Finally, some study participants raised concerns as to their ability to communicate science effectively, the availability of time and resources, and the lack of proper rewards, particularly in terms of career advancement, for those who engage in science efforts. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that bioscientists' intentions to engage in science communication efforts must be better studied to develop empirically-informed interventions to increase scientists\u2019 participation in science outreach efforts.", u'/articles/6-209/v1', ['Publishing, Education & Communication'], [u'Department of History and Social Sciences, Bryant University, Smithfield, RI, 02917, USA', u'IFOM - The FIRC Institute of Molecular Oncology, Milan, 20139, Italy', u'Department of Health Policy and Management, Harvard T.H.

[u'The impact factor of an open access journal does not contribute to an article\u2019s citations', ['SK Chua', 'Ahmad M Qureshi', 'Vijay Krishnan', 'Dinker R Pai', 'Laila B Kamal', 'Sharmilla Gunasegaran', 'MZ Afzal', 'Lahiru Ambawatta', 'JY Gan', 'PY Kew', 'Than Winn', 'Suneet Sood'], u'02 Mar 2017', u'Background\r\nCitations of papers are positively influenced by the journal\u2019s impact factor (IF). For non-open access (non-OA) journals, this influence may be due to the fact that high-IF journals are more often purchased by libraries, and are therefore more often available to researchers, than low-IF journals. This positive influence has not, however, been shown specifically for papers published in open access (OA) journals, which are universally accessible, and do not need library purchase. It is therefore important to ascertain if the IF influences citations in OA journals too.\r\nMethods\r\n203 randomized controlled trials (102 OA and 101 non-OA) published in January 2011 were included in the study. Five-year citations for papers published in OA journals were compared to those for non-OA journals. Source papers were derived from PubMed. Citations were retrieved from Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases. The Thompson-Reuter\u2019s IF was used.\r\nResults\r\nOA journals were found to have significantly more citations overall compared to non-OA journals (median 15.5 vs 12, p=0.039). The IF did not correlate with citations for OA journals (Spearman\u2019s rho =0.187, p=0.60). The increase in the citations with increasing IF was minimal for OA journals (beta coefficient = 3.346, 95% CI -0.464, 7.156, p=0.084). In contrast, the IF did show moderate correlation with citations for articles published in non-OA journals (Spearman\u2019s rho=0.514, p<0.001). The increase in the number of citations was also significant (beta coefficient = 4.347, 95% CI 2.42, 6.274, p<0.001).\r\nConclusion\r\nIt is better to publish in an OA journal for more citations. It may not be worth paying high publishing fees for higher IF journals, because there is minimal gain in terms of increased number of citations. On the other hand, if one wishes to publish in a non-OA journal, it is better to choose one with a high IF.', u'/articles/6-208/v1', ['Publishing, Education & Communication'], [u'Jeffrey Cheah School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Monash University Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia', u'Department of Public Health, Jeffrey Cheah School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Monash University Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia', u'All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India', u'Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, JurongHealth, Jurong East, Singapore', u'Department of Community Medicine, MAHSA University, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia', u'Department of Surgery, Jeffrey Cheah School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Monash University Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia']]
