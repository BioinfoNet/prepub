[u'Annotated mitochondrial genome with Nanopore R9 signal for Nippostrongylus brasiliensis', ['Jodie Chandler', 'Mali Camberis', 'Tiffany Bouchery', 'Mark Blaxter', 'Graham Le Gros', 'David A Eccles'], u'19 Jan 2017', u'Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, a nematode parasite of rodents, has a parasitic life cycle that is an extremely useful model for the study of human hookworm infection, particularly in regards to the induced immune response. The current reference genome for this parasite is highly fragmented with minimal annotation, but new advances in long-read sequencing suggest that a more complete and annotated assembly should be an achievable goal. We de-novo\xa0assembled a single contig mitochondrial genome from N. brasiliensis\xa0using MinION R9 nanopore data. The assembly was error-corrected using existing Illumina HiSeq reads, and annotated in full (i.e. gene boundary definitions without substantial gaps) by comparing with annotated genomes from similar parasite relatives. The mitochondrial genome has also been annotated with a preliminary electrical consensus sequence, using raw signal data generated from a Nanopore R9 flow cell.', u'/articles/6-56/v1', ['Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases', 'Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'Malaghan Institute of Medical Research, Wellington, New Zealand', u'\xc9cole Polytechnique F\xe9d\xe9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland', u'Institute of Evolutionary Biology, School of Biological Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK']]
