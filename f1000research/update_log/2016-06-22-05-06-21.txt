[u'Bringing your tools to CyVerse Discovery Environment using Docker', ['Upendra Kumar Devisetty', 'Kathleen Kennedy', 'Paul Sarando', 'Nirav Merchant', 'Eric Lyons'], u'21 Jun 2016', u'Docker has become a very popular container-based virtualization platform for software\xa0distribution that has revolutionized the way in which scientific software and software\xa0dependencies (software stacks) can be packaged, distributed, and deployed. Docker makes\xa0the complex and time-consuming installation procedures needed for scientific software a\xa0one-time process. Because it enables platform-independent installation, versioning of software\xa0environments, and easy redeployment and reproducibility, Docker is an ideal candidate\xa0for the deployment of identical software stacks on different compute environments such as\xa0XSEDE and Amazon AWS. CyVerse\u2019s Discovery Environment also uses Docker for integrating\xa0its powerful, community-recommended software tools into CyVerse\u2019s production environment\xa0for public use. This paper will help users bring their tools into CyVerse Discovery\xa0Environment (DE) which will not only allows users to integrate their tools with relative ease\xa0compared to the earlier method of tool deployment in DE but will also help users to share\xa0their apps with collaborators and release them for public use.', u'/articles/5-1442/v1', ['Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'CyVerse, University of Arizona, Tucson, AR, 85721, USA']]
