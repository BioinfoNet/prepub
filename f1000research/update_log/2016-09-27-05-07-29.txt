[u'Development of a clinical algorithm for treating urethral strictures based on a large retrospective single-center cohort', ['Yuri Tolkach', 'Thomas Herrmann', 'Axel Merseburger', 'Martin Burchardt', 'Mathias Wolters', 'Stefan Huusmann', 'Mario Kramer', 'Markus Kuczyk', 'Florian Imkamp'], u'26 Sep 2016', u'Aim\r\nTo analyze clinical data from male patients treated with urethrotomy and to develop a clinical decision algorithm.\nMaterials and methods\r\nTwo large cohorts of male patients with urethral strictures were included in this retrospective study, historical (1985-1995, n=491) and modern cohorts (1996-2006, n=470). All patients were treated with repeated internal urethrotomies (up to 9 sessions). Clinical outcomes were analyzed and systemized as a clinical decision algorithm.\nResults\r\nThe overall recurrence rates after the first urethrotomy were 32.4% and 23% in the historical and modern cohorts, respectively. In many patients, the second procedure was also effective with the third procedure also feasible in selected patients. The strictures with a length \u2264 2 cm should be treated according to the initial length. In patients with strictures \u2264 1 cm, the second session could be recommended in all patients, but not with penile strictures, strictures related to transurethral operations or for patients who were 31-50 years of age. The third session could be effective in selected cases of idiopathic bulbar strictures. For strictures with a length of 1-2 cm, a second operation is possible for the solitary low-grade bulbar strictures, given that the age is > 50 years and the etiology is not post-transurethral resection of the prostate. For penile strictures that are 1-2 cm, urethrotomy could be attempted in solitary but not in high-grade strictures.\nConclusions\r\nWe present data on the treatment of urethral strictures with urethrotomy from a single center. Based on the analysis, a clinical decision algorithm was suggested, which could be a reliable basis for everyday clinical practice.', u'/articles/5-2378/v1', ['Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases', 'Urology, Gynecology & Obstetrics'], [u'Department of Urology and Urological Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany', u'Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany', u'Clinic of Urology, University Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany']]

We adapted an existing, commercial, off-the-shelf, in-vehicle device for naturalistic, longitudinal research to better understand daily driving behavior in older drivers.\nDesign: The Azuga G2 Tracking DeviceTM was installed in each participant\u2019s vehicle, and we collected data over 5 months (speed, latitude/longitude) every 30-seconds when the vehicle was driven.\xa0\nSetting: The Knight Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Center at Washington University School of Medicine.\nParticipants: Five individuals enrolled in a larger, longitudinal study assessing preclinical Alzheimer disease and driving performance.\xa0 Participants were aged 65+ years and had normal cognition.\nMeasurements: \xa0Spatial components included Primary Location(s), Driving Areas, Mean Centers and Unique Destinations.\xa0 Temporal components included number of trips taken during different times of the day.\xa0 Behavioral components included number of hard braking, speeding and sudden acceleration events.\nMethods: \xa0Individual 30-second observations, each comprising one breadcrumb, and trip-level data were collected and analyzed in R and ArcGIS.\xa0\nResults: Primary locations were confirmed to be 100% accurate when compared to known addresses.\xa0 Based on the locations of the breadcrumbs, we were able to successfully identify frequently visited locations and general travel patterns.\xa0 Based on the reported time from the breadcrumbs, we could assess number of trips driven in daylight vs. night.\xa0 Data on additional events while driving allowed us to compute the number of adverse driving alerts over the course of the 5-month period.\nConclusions: This pilot study indicated that Driving Profiles for older adults can be created and compared month-to-month or year-to-year, allowing researchers to identify changes in driving patterns that are unavailable in controlled conditions.', u'/articles/5-2376/v1', ['Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry'], [u'Charles F. and Joanne Knight Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Center, Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, 63130, USA', u'Data and GIS Services, University Libraries, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO, 63130, USA', u'Pathology and Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, 63110, USA', u'Physical Therapy, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, 63110, USA', u'Occupational Therapy, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, 63110, USA', u'Departments of Medicine and Neurology, Divisions of Geriatrics and Nutritional Science/Neurorehabilitation, St. Louis, MO, 63110, USA', u'Department of Neurology, Warren Alpert Medical School, Brown University, and Rhode Island Hospital, Providence, Rhode Island, USA']]

We present frequency statistics, and inter-observer reliability measures that qualify and quantify semantic conflict in the stimulus. While the number of identified events is limited, this annotation nevertheless enriches the knowledge about the complex high-level structure of this stimulus, and can help to evaluate its utility for future studies, and the usability of the existing brain imaging data regarding this aspect of cognition.', u'/articles/5-2375/v1', ['Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry'], [u'Psychoinformatics Lab, Department of Psychology, University of Magdeburg, Magdeburg, 39106, Germany', u'Center for Behavioral Brain Sciences, Magdeburg, Germany']]
