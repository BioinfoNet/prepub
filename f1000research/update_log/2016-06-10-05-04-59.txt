[u'Facebook and mental wellbeing: a crossover randomised controlled study', ['Achim Wolf'], u'09 Jun 2016', u'Objective:\xa0To study the effect of reducing Facebook use for two weeks on self-reported mental wellbeing in a student population.\nMethods:\xa0Students at the University of Oxford (n=78) participated in a randomised crossover study which consisted of two consecutive two-week periods of minimised Facebook use, followed by normal Facebook use, or vice-versa. Participants were evaluated after each two-week period using the 14-item Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (WEMWBS), and completed questionnaires about their Facebook use. Differences in WEMWBS scores were evaluated using a paired t-test.\nResults:\xa0Of those enrolled, 57 (73%) students completed the entire study. 93% reported reduced Facebook use during the intervention period. When limiting their Facebook use, participants had an average WEMWBS score of 46.0, compared to 43.7 during the control period, equating to a difference of 2.3 points (95% CI: 0.4 to 4.2; p=0.016; Cohen\u2019s d = 0.33).\xa0 There were no significant differences in dropout between the two groups (p=0.3), or differences in effect when stratifying by gender (p=0.9) or relationship status (p=0.6).\nConclusion:\xa0Reducing Facebook use may be an effective intervention for improving mental wellbeing in university students. Future studies should examine effects in other participant groups, and use longer follow-up periods.', u'/articles/5-1311/v1', ['Publishing, Education & Communication', 'Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry'], [u'Department of Psychiatry, Warneford Hospital, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 7JX, UK']]
[u'A step-by-step overview of the dynamic process of epitope selection by major histocompatibility complex class II for presentation to helper T cells', ['Scheherazade Sadegh-Nasseri'], u'09 Jun 2016', u'T cell antigen receptors (TCRs) expressed on cytotoxic or helper T cells can only see their specific target antigen as short sequences of peptides bound to the groove of proteins of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I, and class II respectively. In addition to the many steps, several participating proteins, and multiple cellular compartments involved in the processing of antigens, the MHC structure, with its dynamic and flexible groove, has perfectly evolved as the underlying instrument for epitope selection. In this review, I have taken a step-by-step, and rather historical, view to describe antigen processing and determinant selection, as we understand it today, all based on decades of intense research by hundreds of laboratories.', u'/articles/5-1305/v1', ['Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases', 'Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, 21205, USA']]
[u'RiboProfiling: a Bioconductor package for standard Ribo-seq pipeline processing', ['Alexandra Popa', 'Kevin Lebrigand', 'Agnes Paquet', 'Nicolas Nottet', 'Karine Robbe-Sermesant', 'Rainer Waldmann', 'Pascal Barbry'], u'09 Jun 2016', u'The ribosome profiling technique (Ribo-seq) allows the selective sequencing of translated\xa0RNA regions. Recently, the analysis of genomic sequences associated to Ribo-seq reads\xa0has been widely employed to assess their coding potential. These analyses led to the identification\xa0of differentially translated transcripts under different experimental conditions, and/or\xa0ribosome pausing on codon motifs. In the context of the ever-growing need for tools analyzing\xa0Ribo-seq reads, we have developed \u2018RiboProfiling\u2019, a new Bioconductor open-source\xa0package. \u2018RiboProfiling\u2019 provides a full pipeline to cover all key steps for the analysis of ribosome\xa0footprints. This pipeline has been implemented in a single R workflow. The package\xa0takes an alignment (BAM) file as input and performs ribosome footprint quantification at a\xa0transcript level. It also identifies footprint accumulation on particular amino acids or multi\xa0amino-acids motifs. Report summary graphs and data quantification are generated automatically.\xa0The package facilitates quality assessment and quantification of Ribo-seq experiments. Its\xa0implementation in Bioconductor enables the modeling and statistical analysis of its output\xa0through the vast choice of packages available in R. This article illustrates how to identify\xa0codon-motifs accumulating ribosome footprints, based on data from Escherichia coli.', u'/articles/5-1309/v1', ['Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'Institut de Pharmacologie Mol\xb4eculaire et Cellulaire, University Nice Sophia Antipolis and CNRS, Sophia- Antipolis, 06560, France']]
