At the heart of this are the data resources, tools and services that ELIXIR offers to the life-sciences community, providing stable and sustainable access to biological data. ELIXIR aims to ensure that these resources are available long-term and that the life-cycles of these resources are managed such that they support the scientific needs of the life-sciences, including biological research.\n\r\nELIXIR Core Data Resources are defined as a set of European data resources that are of fundamental importance to the wider life-science community and the long-term preservation of biological data. They are complete collections of generic value to life-science, are considered an authority in their field with respect to one or more characteristics, and show high levels of scientific quality and service. Thus, ELIXIR Core Data Resources are of wide applicability and usage.\n\r\nThis paper describes the structures, governance and processes that support the identification and evaluation of ELIXIR Core Data Resources. It identifies key indicators which reflect the essence of the definition of an ELIXIR Core Data Resource and support the promotion of excellence in resource development and operation. It describes the specific indicators in more detail and explains their application within ELIXIR\u2019s sustainability strategy and science policy actions, and in capacity building, life-cycle management and technical actions.\n\r\nEstablishing the portfolio of ELIXIR Core Data Resources and ELIXIR Services is a key priority for ELIXIR and publicly marks the transition towards a cohesive infrastructure.', u'/articles/5-2422/v1', ['Publishing, Education & Communication', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Lausanne, Switzerland', u'European Molecular Biology Laboratory, European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), Cambridge, UK', u'ELIXIR, Cambridge, UK', u'SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Geneva, Switzerland', u'Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncol\xf3gicas, Madrid, Spain']]
