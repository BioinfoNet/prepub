[u'Predictors and brain connectivity changes associated with arm motor function improvement from intensive robotic practice in chronic stroke', ['George F. Wittenberg', 'Lorie G. Richards', 'Lauren M. Jones-Lush', 'Steven R. Roys', 'Rao P. Gullapalli', 'Suzy Yang', 'Peter D. Guarino', 'Albert C. Lo'], u'31 Aug 2016', u'Background and Purpose: The brain changes that underlie therapy-induced improvement\xa0in motor function after stroke remain obscure. This study sought to\xa0demonstrate the feasibility and utility of measuring motor system physiology in\xa0a clinical trial of intensive upper extremity rehabilitation in chronic stroke-related\xa0hemiparesis.\nMethods: This was a substudy of two multi-center clinical trials of\xa0intensive robotic arm therapy in chronic, significantly hemiparetic, stroke patients.\xa0Transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to measure motor cortical output to the\xa0biceps and extensor digitorum communus muscles. Magnetic resonance imaging\xa0(MRI) was used to determine the cortical anatomy, as well as to measure fractional\xa0anisotropy, and blood oxygenation (BOLD) during an eyes-closed rest state.\xa0Region-of-interest time-series correlation analysis was performed on the BOLD signal\xa0to determine interregional connectivity. Functional status was measured with\xa0the upper extremity Fugl-Meyer and Wolf Motor Function Test.\nResults: Motor\xa0evoked potential (MEP) presence was associated with better functional outcomes,\xa0but the effect was not significant when considering baseline impairment. Affected\xa0side internal capsule fractional anisotropy was associated with better function at\xa0baseline. Affected side primary motor cortex (M1) activity became more correlated\xa0with other frontal motor regions after treatment. Resting state connectivity\xa0between affected hemisphere M1 and dorsal premotor area (PMAd) predicted recovery.\xa0\nConclusions: Presence of motor evoked potentials in the affected motor\xa0cortex and its functional connectivity with PMAd may be useful in predicting recovery.\xa0Functional connectivity in the motor network shows a trends towards increasing\xa0after intensive robotic or non-robotic arm therapy.\r\nClinical Trial Registration URL:\xa0http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

[u'Predicting Outcomes of Hormone and Chemotherapy in the Molecular\xa0Taxonomy of\xa0Breast Cancer\xa0International\xa0Consortium (METABRIC) Study by Biochemically-inspired Machine Learning', ['Iman Rezaeian', 'Eliseos J. Mucaki', 'Katherina Baranova', 'Huy Q. Pham', 'Dimo Angelov', 'Alioune Ngom', 'Luis Rueda', 'Peter K. Rogan'], u'31 Aug 2016', u'Genomic aberrations and gene expression-defined subtypes in the large METABRIC patient cohort have been used to stratify and predict survival. The present study used normalized gene expression signatures of paclitaxel drug response to predict outcome for different survival times in METABRIC patients receiving hormone (HT) and, in some cases, chemotherapy (CT) agents. This machine learning method, which distinguishes sensitivity vs. resistance in breast cancer cell lines and validates predictions in patients, was also used to derive gene signatures of other HT \xa0(tamoxifen) and CT agents (methotrexate, epirubicin, doxorubicin, and 5-fluorouracil) used in METABRIC. Paclitaxel gene signatures exhibited the best performance, however the other agents also predicted survival with acceptable accuracies. A support vector machine (SVM) model of paclitaxel response containing the ABCB1, ABCB11, ABCC1, ABCC10, BAD, BBC3, BCL2, BCL2L1, BMF, CYP2C8, CYP3A4, MAP2, MAP4, MAPT, NR1I2, SLCO1B3, TUBB1, TUBB4A, TUBB4B genes was 78.6% accurate in 84 patients treated with both HT and CT (median survival \u2265 4.4 yr). Accuracy was lower (73.4%) in 304 untreated patients. The performance of other machine learning approaches were also evaluated at different survival thresholds. Minimum redundancy maximum relevance feature selection of a paclitaxel-based SVM classifier based on expression of ABCB11, ABCC1, BAD, BBC3 and BCL2L1 was 79% accurate in 53 CT patients. A random forest (RF) classifier produced a gene signature (ABCB11, ABCC1, BAD, BCL2, CYP2C8, CYP3A4, MAP4, MAPT, NR1I2, TUBB1, GBP1, OPRK1) that predicted >3 year survival with 82.4% accuracy in 420 HT patients. A similar RF gene signature showed 79.6% accuracy in 504 patients treated with CT and/or HT. These results suggest that tumor gene expression signatures refined by machine learning techniques can be useful for predicting survival after drug therapies.', u'/articles/5-2124/v1', ['Oncology & Hematology', 'Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'Department of Computer Science, University of Windsor, Windsor, Canada', u'Department of Biochemistry, University of Western Ontario, London, Canada', u'Department of Computer Science, University of Western Ontario, London, Canada', u'CytoGnomix Inc, London, Canada']]
[u'A step-by-step workflow for low-level analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data', ['Aaron T.L. Lun', 'Davis J. McCarthy', 'John C. Marioni'], u'31 Aug 2016', u'Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is widely used to profile the transcriptome of individual cells. This provides biological resolution that cannot be matched by bulk RNA sequencing, at the cost of increased technical noise and data complexity. The differences between scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq data mean that the analysis of the former cannot be performed by recycling bioinformatics pipelines for the latter. Rather, dedicated single-cell methods are required at various steps to exploit the cellular resolution while accounting for technical noise. This article describes a computational workflow for low-level analyses of scRNA-seq data, based primarily on software packages from the open-source Bioconductor project. It covers basic steps including quality control, data exploration and normalization, as well as more complex procedures such as cell cycle phase assignment, identification of highly variable and correlated genes, clustering into subpopulations and marker gene detection. Analyses were demonstrated on gene-level count data from several publicly available data sets involving haematopoietic stem cells, brain-derived cells, T-helper cells and mouse embryonic stem cells. This will provide a range of usage scenarios from which readers can construct their own analysis pipelines.', u'/articles/5-2122/v1', ['Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute, Cambridge, UK', u'EMBL European Bioinformatics Institute, Cambridge, UK', u'St Vincent\u2019s Institute of Medical Research, Fitzroy, Australia', u'Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Cambridge, UK']]
