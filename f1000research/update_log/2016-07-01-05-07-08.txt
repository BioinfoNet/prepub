Injudicious transfusion is frequently performed in current practice, even though it is not always needed. This study aimed to identify the predictive factors of blood loss in the PCNL procedure and evaluate the perioperative transfusion practice.\r\n\xa0\nMethods\r\nA prospective study of PCNL was randomly performed by two consultants of endo-urology at our institution. The inclusion criteria were adults with kidney pelvic stones >20 mm or stone in inferior calyx >10 mm or staghorn stone. Those with coagulopathy, under anti-coagulant treatment or open conversion were excluded. A full blood count was taken at baseline and during 12, 24, 36, 72-hours post-operatively. Factors such as stone burden, sex, body surface area, shifting of hematocrit level and amount of blood transfused were analyzed statistically using line regression to identify the predictive factors of total blood loss (TBL).\n\xa0\r\nResults\r\nEighty-five patients were enrolled in this study. Mean TBL was 560.92 \xb1 428.43 mL for both endo-urology surgeons. Stone burden was the most influential factor for TBL (p=0.037). Our results revealed that TBL (mL) = -153.379 + 0.229 \xd7 stone burden (mm2) + 0.203 x baseline serum hematocrit (%); thus considerably predicted the need for blood transfusion. A total of 87.1% patients did not receive perioperative transfusion, 3.5% received intra-operative transfusion, 7.1% received post-operative transfusion, 23% had both intra and post-operative transfusion, resulting in a cross-matched transfusion ratio of 7.72. Mean perioperative blood transfused was 356.00 \xb1 145.88 mL.', u'/articles/5-1550/v1', ['Cardiopulmonary & Vascular Disorders', 'Hepatology & Nephrology', 'Urology, Gynecology & Obstetrics'], [u'Department of Urology, Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital / Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia, Jakarta, 10430, Indonesia']]
[u'Revitalizing biomedical research: recommendations from the Future of Research Chicago Symposium', ['Kyle T. Dolan', 'Joseph F. Pierre', 'Erin J.

Input from junior scientists into the nature of how these challenges affect both the quality of the enterprise and career outcomes is essential to craft effective reforms that will bring a new era of robustness into biomedical research. In October 2015, junior scientists based in Chicago organized the Future of Research Chicago Symposium. The goals of the meeting were twofold: first, to educate the local community about structural problems in biomedical science; and second, to survey scientists in the Midwest, particularly postdocs, in order to find out their views on these issues and solicit suggestions for improvement. We present the recommendations of Symposium participants as distilled by the organizers. These recommendations reflect junior scientists\u2019 desire for diversification of career development opportunities within the framework of doctoral and postdoctoral training and for policies at funding agencies that demonstrate a stronger commitment to supporting trainees and new investigators. We discuss practical steps that can be taken to enable these reforms, highlighting the responsibilities of junior scientists, faculty, funding agencies, and other stakeholders in working toward the goal of a revitalized biomedical research system.', u'/articles/5-1548/v1', ['Publishing, Education & Communication'], [u'Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, 60637, USA', u'Office of Graduate and Postdoctoral Affairs, Biological Sciences Division, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, 60637, USA']]

[u'Evaluation of unique identifiers used for citation linking', ['Heidi Holst Madsen', 'Dicte Madsen', 'Marianne Gauffriau'], u'29 Jun 2016', u'Unique identifiers (UID) are seen as an effective tool to create links between identical publications in databases or identify duplicates in a database. The purpose of the present study is to investigate how well UIDs work for citation linking. We have two objectives:\r\n\nExplore the coverage, precision, and characteristics of publications matched versus not matched with UIDs as the match key.\r\n\t\xa0\nIllustrate how publication sets formed by using UIDs as the match key may affect the bibliometric indicators: Number of publications, number of citations and the average number of citations per publication.\n\r\n\xa0\r\nThe objectives are addressed in a literature review and a case study. The literature review shows that only a few studies evaluate how well UIDs work as a match key. From the literature we identify four error types: Duplicate digital object identifiers (DOI), incorrect DOIs in reference lists and databases, DOIs not registered by the database where a bibliometric analysis is performed, and erroneous optical or special character recognition.\r\n\xa0\r\nThe case study explores the use of UIDs in the integration between the databases Pure and SciVal. Specifically journal publications in English are matched between the two databases. We find all error types except erroneous optical or special character recognition in our publication sets. In particular the duplicate DOIs constitute a problem for the calculation of bibliometric indicators as both keeping the duplicates to improve the reliability of citation counts and deleting them to improve the reliability of publication counts will distort the calculation of average number of citations per publication.\r\n\xa0\r\nThe use of UIDs as a match key in citation linking is implemented in many settings, and the availability of UIDs may become critical for the inclusion of a publication or a database in a bibliometric analysis.', u'/articles/5-1539/v1', ['Publishing, Education & Communication'], [u'Faculty Library of Natural and Health Sciences, Copenhagen University Library, The Royal Library, Copenhagen, DK-2200, Denmark', u'SUND Research & Innovation, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, DK-2200, Denmark']]

As microscopy techniques advanced, the early microscopists became the first cell biologists to observe the inner workings and subcellular structures that control life. This ability to see organelles within a cell provided scientists with the first understanding of how cells function. The visualization of the dynamic architecture of subcellular structures now often drives questions as researchers seek to understand the intricacies of the cell. With the advent of fluorescent labeling techniques, better and new optical techniques, and more sensitive and faster cameras, a whole array of questions can now be asked.

Treatment is directed toward the prevention of recurrent infection through use of continuous antibiotic prophylaxis during a period of observation for spontaneous resolution or by surgical correction.

[u'Plant adaptation to drought stress', ['Supratim Basu', 'Venkategowda Ramegowda', 'Anuj Kumar', 'Andy Pereira'], u'30 Jun 2016', u'Plants in their natural habitats adapt to drought stress in the environment through a variety of mechanisms, ranging from transient responses to low soil moisture to major survival mechanisms of escape by early flowering in absence of seasonal rainfall. However, crop plants selected by humans to yield products such as grain, vegetable, or fruit in favorable environments with high inputs of water and fertilizer are expected to yield an economic product in response to inputs. Crop plants selected for their economic yield need to survive drought stress through mechanisms that maintain crop yield. Studies on model plants for their survival under stress do not, therefore, always translate to yield of crop plants under stress, and different aspects of drought stress response need to be emphasized. The crop plant model rice (Oryza sativa) is used here as an example to highlight mechanisms and genes for adaptation of crop plants to drought stress.', u'/articles/5-1554/v1', ['Development & Evolution', 'Plant Biology, Ecology & Environmental Sciences'], [u'Crop, Soil, and Environmental Sciences, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, Arkansas, 72701, USA']]
[u'Circadian clock regulation of skeletal muscle growth and repair', ['Somik Chatterjee', 'Ke Ma'], u'30 Jun 2016', u'Accumulating evidence indicates that the circadian clock, a transcriptional/translational feedback circuit that generates ~24-hour oscillations in behavior and physiology, is a key temporal regulatory mechanism involved in many important aspects of muscle physiology. Given the clock as an evolutionarily-conserved time-keeping mechanism that synchronizes internal physiology to environmental cues, locomotor activities initiated by skeletal muscle enable entrainment to the light-dark cycles on earth, thus ensuring organismal survival and fitness. Despite the current understanding of the role of molecular clock in preventing age-related sarcopenia, investigations into the underlying molecular pathways that transmit clock signals to the maintenance of skeletal muscle growth and function are only emerging. In the current review, the importance of the muscle clock in maintaining muscle mass during development, repair and aging, together with its contribution to muscle metabolism, will be discussed. Based on our current understandings of how tissue-intrinsic muscle clock functions in the key aspects muscle physiology, interventions targeting the myogenic-modulatory activities of the clock circuit may offer new avenues for prevention and treatment of muscular diseases.

[u'Recent Insights into Cell Surface Heparan Sulphate Proteoglycans and Cancer', ['John R Couchman', 'Hinke Multhaupt', 'Ralph D. Sanderson'], u'29 Jun 2016', u'A small group of cell surface receptors are proteoglycans, possessing a core protein with one or more covalently attached glycosaminoglycan chains. They are virtually ubiquitous and their chains are major sites at which protein ligands of many types interact. These proteoglycans can signal and regulate important cell processes, such as adhesion, migration, proliferation, and differentiation. Since many protein ligands, such as growth factors, morphogens, and cytokines, are also implicated in tumour progression, it is increasingly apparent that cell surface proteoglycans impact tumour cell behaviour. Here, we review some recent advances, emphasising that many tumour-related functions of proteoglycans are revealed only after their modification in processes subsequent to synthesis and export to the cell surface. These include enzymes that modify heparan sulphate structure, recycling of whole or fragmented proteoglycans into exosomes that can be paracrine effectors or biomarkers, and lateral interactions between some proteoglycans and calcium channels that impact the actin cytoskeleton.', u'/articles/5-1541/v1', ['Oncology & Hematology', 'Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'Department of Biomedical Sciences and Biotech Research & Innovation Center, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark', u'Department of Pathology and University of Alabama at Birmingham Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA']]

These projects have provided unprecedented opportunities to interrogate the epigenome of cultured cancer cell lines as well as normal and tumor tissues with high genomic resolution. The bioconductor project offers more than 1,000 open-source software and statistical packages to analyze high-throughput genomic data. However, most packages are designed for specific data types (e.g. expression, epigenetics, genomics) and there is no comprehensive tool that provides a complete integrative analysis harnessing the resources and data provided by all three public projects. A need to create an integration of these different analyses was recently proposed.
