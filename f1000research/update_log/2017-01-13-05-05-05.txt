[u'Genome-wide characterization of folate transporter proteins of eukaryotic pathogens', ['Mofolusho Falade', 'Benson Otarigho'], u'12 Jan 2017', u'Background: Medically important pathogens are responsible for the death of millions every year. For many of these pathogens, there are limited options for therapy and resistance to commonly used drugs is fast emerging. The availability of genome sequences of many eukaryotic protozoa is providing important data for understanding parasite biology and identifying new drug and vaccine targets. The folate synthesis and salvage pathway are important for eukaryote pathogen survival and organismal biology and may present new targets for drug discovery.\nMethods: We applied a combination of bioinformatics methods to examine the genomes of pathogens in the EupathDB for genes encoding homologues of proteins that mediate folate salvage in a bid to identify and assign putative functions. We also performed phylogenetic comparisons of identified proteins. .\nResults: We identified 234 proteins to be involve in folate transport in 63 strains, 28 pathogen species and 12 phyla, 60% of which were identified for the first time. Many of the genomes examined contained genes encoding transporters such as folate-binding protein YgfZ, folate/pteridine transporter, folate/biopterin transporter, reduced folate carrier family protein, folate/methotrexate transporter FT1. The mitochondrion is the predicted location of the majority of the proteins, with 15% possessing signal peptides. Phylogeny computation shows the similarity of the proteins identified.\nConclusion: These findings offer new possibilities for potential drug development targeting folate-salvage proteins in eukaryotic pathogens.', u'/articles/6-36/v1', ['Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases', 'Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology', 'Physiology, Pharmacology & Drug Discovery'], [u'Cellular Parasitology Programme, Department of Zoology, University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria', u'Department of Biological Science, Edo University, Iyamho, Nigeria']]
[u'Texture analysis of the developing human brain using customization of a knowledge-based system', ['Hugues Gentillon', 'Ludomir Stefanczyk', 'Micha Strzelecki', 'Maria Respondek-Liberska'], u'12 Jan 2017', u'Background: Pattern recognition software originally designed for geospatial and other technical applications could be trained by physicians and used as texture-analysis tools for evidence-based practice, in order to improve diagnostic imaging examination during pregnancy.\r\n\xa0\r\nMethods: Various machine-learning techniques and customized datasets were assessed for training of an integrable knowledge-based system (KBS), to determine a hypothetical methodology for texture classification of closely-related anatomical structures in fetal brain magnetic resonance (MR) images. Samples were manually categorized according to the magnetic field of the MRI scanner (i.e. 1.5-tesla (1.5T), 3-tesla (3T)), rotational planes (i.e. coronal, sagittal and axial), and signal weighting (i.e. spin-lattice, spin-spin, relaxation, proton density). In the machine-learning sessions, the operator manually selected relevant regions of interest (ROI) in 1.5/3T MR images. Semi-automatic procedures in MaZda/B11 were performed to determine optimal parameter sets for ROI\xa0classification. Four classes were defined: ventricles, thalamus, grey matter, and white matter. Various textures analysis methods were tested. The KBS performed automatic data pre-processing and semi-automatic classification of ROIs.\r\n\xa0\r\nResults: After testing 3456 ROIs, statistical binary classification revealed that combination of reduction techniques with linear discriminant algorithms (LDA) or nonlinear discriminant algorithms (NDA) yielded the best scoring in terms of sensitivity (both 100%, 95% CI: 99.79-100), specificity (both 100%, 95% CI: 99.79-100) and Fisher coefficient (\u2248E+4, \u2248E+5, respectively).\r\n\xa0\r\n\xa0Conclusions: LDA and NDA in MaZda can be useful data mining tools for screening a population of interest subjected to a clinical test.', u'/articles/6-40/v1', ['Neuroscience, Neurology & Psychiatry'], [u'Department of Radiology and Diagnostic Imaging, Barlicki University Hospital, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland', u'Institute of Electronics, The Faculty of Electrical, Electronic, Computer and Control Engineering, Technical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland', u'Diagnosis and Prevention of Congenital Malformations, Instytut Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki, Lodz, Poland']]
[u'Genome-wide measurement of spatial expression in patterning mutants of Drosophila melanogaster', ['Peter A. Combs', 'Michael B. Eisen'], u'12 Jan 2017', u'Patterning in the Drosophila melanogaster embryo is affected by multiple maternal factors, but the effect of these factors on spatial gene expression has not been systematically analyzed. Here we characterize the effect of the maternal factors Zelda, Hunchback and Bicoid by cryosectioning wildtype and mutant blastoderm stage embryos and sequencing mRNA from each slice. The resulting atlas of spatial gene expression highlights the intersecting roles of these factors in regulating spatial patterns, and serves as a resource for researchers studying spatial patterning in the early embryo. We identify a large number of genes with both expected and unexpected patterning changes, and through integrated analysis of transcription factor binding data identify common themes in genes with complex dependence on these transcription factors.', u'/articles/6-41/v1', ['Molecular, Cellular & Structural Biology', 'Genomics, Computational & Systems Biology'], [u'Graduate Program in Biophysics, University of California, Berkley, USA', u'Department of Molecular and Cell Biology and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of California, Berkeley, USA']]
