[u'Mechanical activation of epithelial Na+ channel relies on an interdependent activity of the extracellular matrix and extracellular N-glycans of \u03b1ENaC', ['Fenja Knoepp', 'Zoe Ashley', 'Daniel Barth', 'Marina Kazantseva', 'Pawel P Szczesniak', 'Wolfgang G Clauss', 'Mike Althaus', 'Diego Alvarez de la Rosa', 'Martin Fronius'], u'January 25, 2017.', u'Mechanotransduction describes how cells perceive their mechanical environment and mechanosensitive ion channels are important for this process. ENaC (epithelial Na+ channel)/DEG (degenerin) proteins form mechanosensitive ion channels and it is hypothesized their interaction with the extracellular matrix (ECM) via `tethers \u0301 is required for mechanotransduction. Channels formed by vertebrate \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 ENaC proteins are activated by shear force (SF) and mediate electrolyte/fluid-homeostasis and blood pressure regulation. Here, we report an interdependent activity of ENaC and the ECM that mediates SF effects in murine arteries and heterologously expressed channels. Furthermore, replacement of conserved extracellular N-glycosylated asparagines of \u03b1ENaC decreased the SF response indicating that the attached N-glycans provide a connection to the ECM. Insertion of N-glycosylation sites into a channel subunit, innately lacking these motifs, increased its SF response. These experiments confirm an interdependent channel/ECM activity of mechanosensitive ENaC channel and highlight the role of channel N-glycans as new constituents for the translation of mechanical force into cellular signals.', u'/content/early/2017/01/24/102756', [u'Cell Biology'], [u'University Giessen;', u'University of Otago;', u'University of La Laguna']]
[u'G\u03b1q Mediates Clozapine Effects in Caenorhabditis elegans', ['Limin Hao', 'Yongguang Tong', 'Kristin Harrington', "Jessica L. O'Neill", 'Afsaneh Sheikholeslami', 'Xin Wang', 'Jonathan H. Freedman', 'Bruce M. Cohen', 'Edgar A. Buttner'], u'January 24, 2017.', u'Clozapine binds and has significant effects on multiple neurotransmitter receptors, notably including some dopamine receptors. Downstream of these receptors, clozapine affects the balance of Gi- and Gq-dependent second-messenger signaling. We used Caenorhabiditis elegans as a genetic model to study further how clozapine affects both dopamine receptors and downstream Gq mediated signaling. Four of six worm dopamine receptor orthologs, dop-1, dop-2, dop-4, and dop-5 produced resistance to clozapine induced developmental delay when mutated, suggesting that both type I and type II dopamine receptors mediate the behavioral effects of clozapine in C. elegans. Beyond these receptors, reduction of function of one of the G proteins, egl-30 (G\u03b1q), produced greatly increased susceptibility to clozapine. G\u03b1q has multiple known downstream effects. Among these is the control of acetylcholine release, which is in balance with monoamines in the human brain and is another target of clozapine and other antipsychotic drugs. We tested for downstream effects on acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction upon clozapine treatment but found no evidence for effects of clozapine. In contrast, modulation of G\u03b1q upstream leads to worms that are either more resistant or more susceptible to clozapine, emphasizing the importance of G\u03b1q proteins in mediating effects of clozapine. A genetic screen for suppressors of egl-30 recovered eight mutants. By characterizing the behavioral effects of these mutants, we found that clozapine exerts its function on development by affecting G\u03b1q signaling through control of the pharyngeal pumping rate. A whole-genome sequencing technique was utilized and identified a list of candidate genes for these suppressor mutations. Further characterization of these mutants promises the discovery of novel components participating in G\u03b1q signaling and a better understanding of the mechanisms of action of clozapine.', u'/content/early/2017/01/24/101998', [u'Genetics'], [u'Program for Neuropsychiatric Research, McLean Hospital, 115 Mill St., Belmont MA 02478;', u'Laboratory of Toxicology and Pharmacology, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences;', u'Dept of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Universilogy, University of Louisville School of Medicine, KY']]
