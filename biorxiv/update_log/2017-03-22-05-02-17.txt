[u'Reversing the Thyroid Hormone Mediated Repression of a HSV-1 Promoter through Computationally Guided Site Directed Mutagenesis', ['Robert William Figliozzi', 'Feng Chen', 'Victor Hsia'], u'March 21, 2017.', u"Thyroid hormones (TH or T3) and their DNA binding nuclear receptors (TRs), direct transcriptional regulation in different ways depending on the host cell environment and specific promoter characteristics of TH sensitive genes. This study sought to elucidate the impact on repression of nucleotide sequence/orientation of TR binding sites, TR elements, (TREs) within TH sensitive promoters. Computational analysis of the HSV-1 thymidine kinase (TK) gene TRE bound by TR and RXR revealed a single TRE point mutation sufficient to reverse the TRE orientation. In vitro experiments corroborated that the TRE point mutation exhibited distinct impacts on promoter activity, sufficient to reverse the TH dependent negative regulation in neuro-endocrine differentiated cells. EMSA and ChIP experiments suggest that this point mutation altered the promoter's regulatory mechanism through discrete changes in transcription factor Sp1 and TR occupancy and altered enrichment of repressive chromatin, histone-3-lysine-9-trimethyl (H3K9Me3). Incites relating to this negative TRE (nTRE) mechanism impacts the understanding of other nTREs and TRE mutations associated with TH and herpes diseases.", u'/content/early/2017/03/21/119115', [], [u'Univ.

Although Pa isolates from CF have long been recognized for their overall higher resistance rate calculated generally by reduced "percent susceptible", this study takes the approach to compare and contrast Etest MIC distributions between two distinct cohorts of clinical strains (n=224 from 56 CF patients and n=130 from 68 non-CF patients respectively) isolated in 2013. Logarithmic transformed MIC (logMIC) values of 11 antimicrobial agents were compared between the two groups. CF isolates tended to produce heterogeneous and widely dispersed MICs compared to non-CF isolates. By applying a test for equality of variances, we were able to confirm that the MICs generated from CF isolates against 9 out of the 11 agents were significantly more dispersed than those from non-CF (p<0.02-<0.001). Quantile-quantiles plots indicated little agreement between the two cohorts of isolates. Based on whole genome sequencing of 19 representative CF Pa isolates, divergent gain- or loss-of-function mutations in efflux and porin genes and their regulators between isogenic or intra-clonal associates were evident. Not one, not a few, but the net effect all adaptive mutational changes in the genomes of CF Pa, both shared and unshared between isogenic strains, are responsible for the divergent heteroresistance patterns. Moreover, the isogenic variations are suggestive of a bacterial syntrophic lifestyle when "locked" inside a host focal airway environment over prolonged periods.', u'/content/early/2017/03/21/118109', [], [u"Seattle Children's Hospital, University of Washington;", u'University of Washington;', u"Seattle Children's Hospital;", u"Shanghai Children's Medical Center"]]
[u'Identifying drivers of parallel evolution: A regression model approach', ['Susan F Bailey', 'Qianyun Guo', 'Thomas Bataillon'], u'March 21, 2017.', u'Parallel evolution, defined as identical changes arising in independent populations, is often attributed to similar selective pressures favoring the fixation of identical genetic changes. However, some level of parallel evolution is also expected if mutation rates are heterogeneous across regions of the genome. Theory suggests that mutation and selection can have equal impacts on patterns of parallel evolution, however empirical studies have yet to jointly quantify the relative importance of these two processes. Here, we introduce several statistical models to examine the contributions of mutation and selection heterogeneity to shaping parallel evolutionary changes at the gene-level. Using this framework we analyze published data from forty experimentally evolved Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations. We can partition the effects of a number of genomic variables into those affecting patterns of parallel evolution via effects on the rate of arising mutations, and those affecting the retention versus loss of the arising mutations (i.e. selection). Our results suggest that gene-to-gene heterogeneity in both mutation and selection, associated with gene length, recombination rate, and number of protein domains drive parallel evolution at both synonymous and nonsynonymous sites.', u'/content/early/2017/03/21/118695', [], [u'Clarkson University;', u'Aarhus University']]

Genes of the ancestral autosomes are often assumed to have undertaken these transitions on uniform terms, but we hypothesized that they varied in their dosage constraints. We inferred such constraints from conservation of microRNA (miRNA)-mediated repression, validated by analysis of experimental data. X-linked genes with a surviving Y homolog have the most conserved miRNA target sites, followed by genes with no Y homolog and subject to XCI, and then genes with no Y homolog but escaping XCI; this heterogeneity existed on the ancestral autosomes. Similar results for avian Z-linked genes, with or without a W homolog, lead to a model of XY/ZW evolution incorporating preexisting dosage sensitivities of individual genes in determining their evolutionary fates, and ultimately shaping the mammalian and avian sex chromosomes.', u'/content/early/2017/03/21/119016', [], [u'Whitehead Institute, United States']]

[u'Prior expectations induce pre-stimulus sensory templates', ['Peter Kok', 'Pim Mostert', 'Floris P De Lange'], u'March 21, 2017.', u'Perception can be described as a process of inference, integrating bottom-up sensory inputs and top-down expectations. However, it is unclear how this process is neurally implemented. It has been proposed that expectations lead to pre-stimulus baseline increases in sensory neurons tuned to the expected stimulus, which in turn affects the processing of subsequent stimuli. Recent fMRI studies have revealed stimulus-specific patterns of activation in sensory cortex as a result of expectation, but this method lacks the temporal resolution necessary to distinguish pre- from post-stimulus processes. Here, we combined human MEG with multivariate decoding techniques to probe the representational content of neural signals in a time-resolved manner. We observed a representation of expected stimuli in the neural signal well before they were presented, demonstrating that expectations indeed induce a pre-activation of stimulus templates. These results suggest a mechanism for how predictive perception can be neurally implemented.', u'/content/early/2017/03/21/119073', [u'Neuroscience'], [u'Princeton University;', u'Radboud University']]
[u'Assessing dynamic functional connectivity in heterogeneous samples', ['Brieuc C L Lehmann', 'Simon R White', 'Richard N Henson', 'Linda Geerligs'], u'March 21, 2017.', u"Several methods have been developed to measure dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) in fMRI data. These methods are often based on a sliding-window analysis, which aims to capture how the brain's functional organization varies over the course of a scan. The aim of many studies is to compare dFC across groups, such as younger versus older people. However, spurious group differences in measured dFC may be caused by other sources of heterogeneity between people. For example, the shape of the haemodynamic response function (HRF) and levels of measurement noise have been found to vary with age. We use a generic simulation framework for fMRI data to investigate the effect of such heterogeneity on estimates of dFC. Our findings show that, despite no differences in true dFC, individual differences in measured dFC can result from other (non-dynamic) features of the data, such as differences in neural autocorrelation, HRF shape, connectivity strength and measurement noise. We also find that common dFC methods such as k-means and multilayer modularity approaches can detect spurious group differences in dynamic connectivity due to inappropriate setting of their hyperparameters. fMRI studies therefore need to consider alternative sources of heterogeneity across individuals before concluding differences in dFC.", u'/content/early/2017/03/21/118968', [u'Neuroscience'], [u'MRC Biostatistics Unit, University of Cambridge;', u'MRC Cognition & Brain Sciences Unit']]
[u'Exploring The Role Of Competition Induced By Non-Vaccine Serotypes For Herd Protection', ['Giovanni Masala', 'Marc Lipsitch', 'Christian Bottomley', 'Stefan Flasche'], u'March 21, 2017.', u'The competitive pressure from non-vaccine serotypes may have helped pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) to limit vaccine serotype (VT) prevalence. We aim to investigate if, consequently, the indirect protection of higher valency vaccines could fall short of the profound effects of current formulations. We compare three previously described pneumococcal models harmonized to simulate 20 serotypes with a combined pre-vaccination prevalence in <5y old children of 40%. We simulate vaccines of increasing valency by adding serotypes in order of their competitiveness and explore their ability to reduce VT carriage by 95% within 10 years after introduction. All models predict that additional valency will reduce indirect vaccine effects and hence the overall vaccine impact on carriage both in children and adults. Consequently, the minimal effective coverage (efficacy against carriage * vaccine coverage) needed to eliminate vaccine type carriage increases with increasing valency. One model predicts this effect to be modest while the other two predict that high-valency vaccines may struggle to eliminate VT pneumococci unless vaccine efficacy against carriage can be substantially improved. Similar results were obtained when settings of higher transmission intensity and different PCV formulations were explored. Failure to eliminate carriage as a result of increased valency could lead to overall decreased impact of vaccination if the disease burden caused by the added serotypes is low. Hence a comparison of vaccine formulations of varying valency, and pan-valent formulations in particular, should consider the invasiveness of targeted serotypes, as well as efficacy against carriage.', u'/content/early/2017/03/21/092593', [u'Ecology'], [u'LSHTM;', u'Harvard']]

[u'MSAP In Tiger Snakes: Island Populations Are Epigenetically More Divergent', ['Carlos M Rodriguez Lopez', 'Moumouni Konate', 'Vicki A Thomson'], u'March 21, 2017.', u'Research on changes in phenotypic plasticity within wild animal populations is centuries old, however far fewer studies have investigated the role that epigenetics play in the development or persistence of natural variation in response to environmental change. Tiger snakes (Notechis scutatus) are an ideal study organism to investigate the link between epigenetics and phenotypic responses to environmental change, as they live on a range of offshore islands with different environments and prey types while exhibiting gigantism and dwarfism in body and head size. In this study, we have generated methylation sensitive amplified polymorphism (MSAP) data and found that, in general, Tiger Snakes are more epigenetically differentiated than genetically differentiated. Each island group has a distinctive epigenetic signal, suggesting the Tiger Snakes on each island group have adapted to their specific environment. This is also supported by the strong positive relationship between epigenetic differentiation and isolation age, as well as between epigenetic/genetic signal and both temperature and precipitation. The Tiger Snakes from Kangaroo Island, which has a complex landscape/environment like the mainland rather than the simple landscape/environment of each of the smaller islands, are both genetically and epigenetically more like the mainland. As the MSAP loci are randomly distributed across the genome, we believe a closer examination of the epigenetic modifications near genes involved in growth, development, and lipid metabolism will allow us to investigate the epigenetic basis for the natural variation in head size and body size on the islands.', u'/content/early/2017/03/21/118836', [u'Evolutionary Biology'], [u'University of Adelaide']]

Taravella', 'Sarah Emery', 'Krishna R. Veeramah', 'Adam R. Boyko', 'Jeffrey M. Kidd'], u'March 21, 2017.', u'Dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) were domesticated from gray wolves between 20-40kya in Eurasia, yet details surrounding the process of domestication remain unclear. The vast array of phenotypes exhibited by dogs mirror numerous other domesticated animal species, a phenomenon known as the Domestication Syndrome. Here, we use signatures persisting in the dog genome to identify genes and pathways altered by the intensive selective pressures of domestication. We identified 37 candidate domestication regions containing 17.5Mb of genome sequence and 172 genes through whole-genome SNP analysis of 43 globally distributed village dogs and 10 wolves. Comparisons with three ancient dog genomes indicate that these regions reflect signatures of domestication rather than breed formation. Analysis of genes within these regions revealed a significant enrichment of gene functions linked to neural crest cell migration, differentiation and development. Genome copy number analysis identified regions of localized sequence and structural diversity, and discovered additional copy-number variation at the amylase-2b locus. Overall, these results indicate that primary selection pressures targeted genes in the neural crest as well as components of the minor spliceosome, rather than genes involved in starch metabolism. Smaller jaw sizes, hairlessness, floppy ears, tameness, and diminished craniofacial development distinguish wolves from domesticated dogs, phenotypes of the Domestication Syndrome that can result from decreased neural crest cells at these sites. We propose that initial selection acted on key genes in the neural crest and minor splicing pathways during early dog domestication, giving rise to the phenotypes of modern dogs.', u'/content/early/2017/03/21/118794', [u'Evolutionary Biology'], [u'University of Michigan;', u'Cornell University']]
[u'DBD-RCO: Derivative Based Detection And Reverse Combinatorial Optimization To Improve Heart Beat Detection For Wearable Devices', ['Andrea Bizzego', 'Cesare Furlanello'], u'March 21, 2017.', u'The diffusion of wearable sensors enables the monitoring of heart physiology in real-life contexts. Wearable technology is characterized by important advantages but also by technical limitations that affect the quality of the collected signals in terms of movement artifacts and presence of noise. Therefore specific signal processing algorithms are required to cope with the lower quality and different characteristic of signals collected with wearable sensor units. Here we propose and validate a pipeline to detect heartbeats in cardiac signals, extract the Inter Beat Intervals (IBI) and compute the Heart Rate Variability (HRV) indicators from wearable devices. In particular, we describe the novel Derivative-Based Detection (DBD) algorithm to estimate the beat position in Blood Volume Pulse (BVP) signals and the Reverse Combinatorial Optimization (RCO) algorithm to identify and correct IBI extraction errors. The pipeline is first validated on data from clinical-grade sensors, then on a benchmark dataset including examples of  movement artifacts in a real-life context. The accuracy of the DBD algorithm is assessed in terms of precision and recall of the detection; error in the IBI values is quantified by root mean square error. The reliability of HRV indicators is evaluated by the Bland-Altman ratio. The DBD algorithm performs better than a state-of-art algorithm for both medical-grade and wearable devices. However, as already found in similar studies, worse reliability is found with the BVP signal in computing frequency domain HRV indicators, in particular with wearable devices.', u'/content/early/2017/03/21/118943', [u'Physiology'], [u'University of Trento;', u'FBK']]

In nematode zygote, cortical dynein pulls on microtubules transiently, raising the question of its targeting and dynamics. Tracking and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy revealed that in the cytoplasm, dynein spots displayed directed motions toward the cortex, localized at microtubule plus-ends through EBP-2/EB but are not actively transported. Surprisingly CLIP-1/CLIP170 is not involved. ebp-2(0) slightly reduced spindle rocking, thus most cortical forces remain suggesting a redundant mechanism. At the cortex, to relate dynein residency and forces generating, we tracked dynein and found two dynamically distinct populations. One of them would correspond to force generating events.
