[u'Logic Synthesis of Recombinase-Based Genetic Circuits', ['Tai-Yin Chiu', 'Jie-Hong Roland Jiang'], u'November 21, 2016.', u'A synthetic approach to biology is a promising technique for various applications. Recent advancements have demonstrated the feasibility of constructing synthetic two-input logic gates in Escherichia coli cells with long-term memory based\non DNA inversion induced by recombinases. On the other hand, recent evidences indicate that DNA inversion mediated by genome editing tools is possible; powerful genome editing technologies, such as CRISPR-Cas9 systems, have great potential to be exploited to implement large-scale recombinase-based circuits. What remains unclear is how to construct arbitrary Boolean functions based on these emerging technologies. In this paper, we lay the theoretical foundation formalizing the connection between recombinase-based genetic circuits and Boolean functions. It enables systematic construction of any given Boolean function using recombinase-based logic gates. We further develop a methodology leveraging existing electronic design automation (EDA) tools to automate the synthesis of complex recombinase-based genetic circuits with respect to area and delay optimization. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed method.', u'/content/early/2016/11/21/088930', [], [u'Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Taiwan University']]

However, the folding times of CLN025 and Trp-cage predicted from the simulations3 are more than 4\u221210 times longer than the experimental values4,5, indicating an accuracy gap between experiment and simulation for folding speed. Here I report how combining a new protein simulation method6 and a revised AMBER forcefield7 results in accurate folding of CLN025 and Trp-cage in 40 distinct, independent, unrestricted, unbiased, and isobaric\u2212isothermal molecular dynamics simulations. According to a survival analysis of these simulations using a C\u03b1-and-C\u03b2 RMSD cutoff of 0.98 \xc5, the simulated folding times of CLN025 at 293 and 300 K and Trp-cage at 280 and 300 K are 279 ns (95% CI: 204\u2212380 ns), 198 ns (95% CI: 146\u2212270 ns), 2.4 \u03bcs (95% CI: 1.8\u22123.3 \u03bcs), and 0.8 \u03bcs (95% CI: 0.6\u22121.0 \u03bcs), respectively. The corresponding experimental values are 261 ns, 137 ns, 2.4 \u03bcs, and 1.4 \u03bcs, respectively4,5. These results show that CLN025 and Trp-cage now can autonomously fold in silico as fast as they do in experiments, indicating that the accuracy of folding simulations begins to overlap with the accuracy of folding experiments.

However, no consensus exists regarding the ubiquity and abundance of these bacterioplankton, which is necessary to evaluate their ecological importance. The present study investigated the bacterioplankton community in the oxygenated hypolimnia of 10 deep freshwater lakes. Despite the broad geochemical characteristics of the lakes, 16S rRNA gene sequencing demonstrated that many predominant lineages in the hypolimnion were shared by several lakes and consisted of members occurring in the entire water layer and members specific to the hypolimnion. Catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization (CARD-FISH) revealed that representative hypolimnion-specific lineages, CL500-11 (Chloroflexi), CL500-3, CL500-37, CL500-15 (Planctomycetes), and the MGI group (Thaumarchaeota), together accounted for 1.5-32.9% of all bacterioplankton in the hypolimnion of the lakes. Furthermore, an analysis of micro-diversification based on single-nucleotide variation in the partial 16S rRNA gene sequence (oligotyping) suggested the presence of hypolimnion-specific ecotypes among the lineages occurring in the entire water layer (e.g., acI and Limnohabitans). Collectively, these results demonstrate the uniqueness, ubiquity, and quantitative significance of bacterioplankton in the oxygenated hypolimnion, motivating future studies to focus on their eco-physiological characteristics.', u'/content/early/2016/11/21/088864', [], [u'Kyoto University;', u'National Institute for Environmental Studies;', u'Nihon University']]

Complete knowledge of all genetic variants, as provided by whole genome sequence (WGS), will help, but is currently financially prohibitive for well powered GWAS studies. To explore the advantages of WGS in a well powered setting, we performed eQTL mapping using WGS and RNA-seq, and showed that the lead eQTL variants called using WGS are more likely to be causal. We derived properties of the causal variant from simulation studies, and used these to propose a method for implicating likely causal SNPs. This method predicts that 25% - 70% of the causal variants lie in open chromatin regions, depending on tissue and experiment. Finally, we identify a set of high confidence causal variants and show that they are more enriched in GWAS associations than other eQTL.

[u'Estimating Drivers of Cell State Transitions Using Gene Regulatory Network Models', ['Daniel Schlauch', 'Kimberly Glass', 'Craig P Hersh', 'Edwin K Silverman', 'John Quackenbush'], u'November 21, 2016.', u'Specific cellular states are often associated with distinct gene expression patterns. These states are plastic, changing during development, or in the transition from health to disease. One relatively simple extension of this concept is to recognize that we can classify different cell-types by their active gene regulatory networks and that, consequently, transitions between cellular states can be modeled by changes in these underlying regulatory networks. Here we describe MONSTER, Modeling Network State Transitions from Expression and Regulatory data, a regression-based method for inferring transcription factor drivers of cell state conditions at the gene regulatory network level. As a demonstration, we apply MONSTER to four different studies of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to identify transcription factors that alter the network structure as the cell state progresses toward the disease-state. Our results demonstrate that MONSTER can find strong regulatory signals that persist across studies and tissues of the same disease and that are not detectable using conventional analysis methods based on differential expression.

Estrogens also activate the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER), however the function of GPER in vivo is less well understood. Here we find that GPER is required to maintain normal heart rate in zebrafish embryos. Acute exposure to estrogens increased heart rate in wildtype and in ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 mutant embryos but not in GPER mutants. Nuclear estrogen receptor signaling remained normal in GPER mutant embryos, however GPER mutant embryos exhibited reduced basal heart rate while heart rate was normal in ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 mutants. We detected GPER transcript in discrete regions of the brain but not in the heart. In the brain, we observed gper expression in cells lacking nuclear estrogen receptor activity, suggesting that GPER acts in the brain to regulate heart rate independently of nuclear estrogen receptor signaling. Our results demonstrate that estradiol plays a previously unappreciated role in the acute modulation of heart rate during zebrafish embryonic development and that GPER functions as an autonomous estrogen receptor in vivo to regulate basal heart rate.', u'/content/early/2016/11/21/088955', [u'Pharmacology and Toxicology'], [u'University of Alabama at Birmingham']]
[u'Visual crowding is a combination of an increase of positional uncertainty, source confusion, and featural averaging', ['William J Harrison', 'Peter J Bex'], u'November 21, 2016.', u'Although we perceive a richly detailed visual world, our ability to identify individual objects is severely limited in clutter, particularly in peripheral vision. Models of such crowding have generally been driven by the phenomenological misidentifications of crowded targets: using stimuli that do not easily combine to form a unique symbol (e.g. letters or objects), observers typically confuse the source of objects and report either the target or a distractor, but when continuous features are used (e.g. orientated gratings or line positions) observers report a feature somewhere between the target and distractor. To reconcile these accounts, we develop a hybrid method of adjustment that allows detailed analysis of these multiple error categories. Observers reported the orientation of a target, under several distractor conditions, by adjusting an identical foveal target. We apply new modelling to quantify whether perceptual reports show evidence of positional uncertainty, source confusion, and featural averaging on a trial-by-trial basis. Our results show that observers make a large proportion of source-confusion errors. However, our study also reveals the distribution of perceptual reports that underlie performance in this crowding task more generally: aggregate errors cannot be neatly labelled because they are heterogeneous and their structure depends on target-distractor distance.', u'/content/early/2016/11/21/088898', [u'Neuroscience'], [u'University of Cambridge;', u'Northeastern University']]

Such analyses can reveal detailed expression dynamics and functional relationships for differentiation. To further elucidate differentiation processes, more insight into gene regulatory networks is required. The pseudo-time can be regarded as time information and, therefore, single-cell RNA-Seq data are time-course data with high time resolution. Although time-course data are useful for inferring networks, conventional inference algorithms for such data suffer from high time complexity when the number of samples and genes is large. Therefore, a novel algorithm is necessary to infer networks from single-cell RNA-Seq during differentiation.\n In this study, we developed the novel and efficient algorithm SCODE to infer regulatory networks, based on ordinary differential equations. We applied SCODE to three single-cell RNA-Seq datasets and confirmed that SCODE can reconstruct observed expression dynamics. We evaluated SCODE by comparing its inferred networks with use of a DNaseI-footprint based network. The performance of SCODE was best for two of the datasets and nearly best for the remaining dataset. We also compared the runtimes and showed that the runtimes for SCODE are significantly shorter than for alternatives. Thus, our algorithm provides a promising approach for further single-cell differentiation analyses.\n The R source code of SCODE is available at https://github.com/hmatsu1226/SCODE.', u'/content/early/2016/11/21/088856', [u'Bioinformatics'], [u'RIKEN;', u'The University of Tokyo;', u'Keio University School of Medicine']]

Gamete fate regulatory networks have been analyzed in nematodes, flies and mammals, but only in C. elegans have terminal intrinsic regulators been identified, which include a Tob/BTG protein family member, FOG-3. Canonical Tob/BTG proteins function as monomeric adaptor proteins that link RNA binding proteins to deadenylases. To ask if FOG-3 functions similarly, we first determined its crystal structure. FOG-3 harbors a classical Tob/BTG fold, but unlike other Tob/BTG proteins, FOG-3 dimerizes and these FOG-3 dimers assemble into polymers. The importance of FOG-3 polymers to sperm fate specification was confirmed in vivo using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to create mutations designed to disrupt the polymer interface. The FOG-3 surface potential is highly basic, suggesting binding to nucleic acid. We find that FOG-3 binds RNA directly with a strong preference for 3'UTRs of oogenic mRNAs.

High-temperature (HT) stress can inhibit microsporogenesis, but the involvement of autophagy in HT injury is unknown. Here we show that Arabidopsis autophagy-defective (atg) mutants are hypersensitive to HT stress during microsporogenesis but not during seedling growth. Fertility was normal at 23 \t\xb0C, but sporophytic male sterility occurred at 30 \t\xb0C. At 30 \t\xb0C, wild-type developing anthers showed increased vacuolization in tapetum and lipophagy in microspores. The atg5-1 mutant did not show these autophagic phenomena, but instead showed irregularly enlarged vacuoles and subsequent shrinkage, and failure of the tapetum to degenerate completely. HT specifically upregulated ATG8 in the developing anther, but not in seedlings, and reduced MYB80 signaling in the anther, which is required for the regulation of tapetal programmed cell death to promote microspore maturation. Interestingly, inhibition of auxin activated the ATG8 signal in seedlings at both 23 and 30 \t\xb0C.
