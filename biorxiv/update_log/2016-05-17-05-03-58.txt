All of these data need to pass some form of quality control processing and checking before they can be used for any analysis. The large number of samples that are run through Illumina sequencing machines makes the process of quality control an onerous and time-consuming task that requires multiple pieces of information from several sources.\n\nResults: AlmostSignificant is an open-source platform for aggregating multiple sources of quality metrics as well as meta-data associated with DNA sequencing runs from Illumina sequencing machines. AlmostSignificant is a graphical platform to streamline the quality control of DNA sequencing data, to collect and store these data for future reference and to collect extra meta-data associated with the sequencing runs to check for errors and monitor the volume of data produced by the associated machines. AlmostSignificant has been used to track the quality of over 80 sequencing runs covering over 2500 samples produced over the last three years.\n\nAvailability: The code and documentation for AlmostSignificant is freely available at https://github.com/bartongroup/AlmostSignificant.', u'/content/early/2016/05/16/053702', [], [u'University of Dundee']]
[u'Dynamic substrate preferences and predicted metabolic properties of a simple microbial consortium', ['Onur Erbilgin', 'Benjamin P Bowen', 'Suzanne M Kosina', 'Stefan Jenkins', 'Rebecca K Lau', 'Trent R Northen'], u'May 16, 2016.', u'Microorganisms are typically found as complex microbial communities that altogether govern global biogeochemical cycles. Microbes have developed highly regulated metabolic capabilities to efficiently use available substrates including preferential substrate usage that can result in diauxic shifts. This and other metabolic behaviors have been discovered in studies of microbes in mono-culture when grown on low-complexity (e.g. two-component) mixtures of substrates, however, little is known about how species partition environmental substrates through substrate competition in more complex substrate mixtures. Here we use exometabolomic profiling to examine the time-varying substrate depletion from a mixture of 19 amino acids and glucose by two Pseudomonads and one Bacillus species isolated from ground water. We examine if the first substrates depleted result in maximal growth rate, or relate to growth medium or biomass composition and find surprisingly few correlations. Patterns of substrate depletion are modeled, and these models are used to examine if substrate usage preferences and substrate depletion kinetics of three microbial isolates can be used to predict the metabolism of the pooled isolates in co-culture.  We find that most of the substrates fit the model predictions, indicating that the microbes are not altering their behaviors for these substrates in the presence of competitors. Glucose and histidine were depleted more slowly than predicted, while proline, glycine, glutamate, lysine, and arginine were all consumed significantly faster; these compounds highlight substrates that could be involved in species-species interactions within the consortium.', u'/content/early/2016/05/16/053777', [], [u'Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory;', u'Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Joint Genome Institute']]
[u'Stochastic simulation tools and continuum models for describing two-dimensional collective cell spreading with universal growth functions', ['Wang Jin', 'Catherine Penington', 'Scott McCue', 'Matthew Simpson'], u'May 16, 2016.', u'Two-dimensional collective cell migration assays are used to study malignant spreading and tissue repair.  These assays involve combined cell migration and cell proliferation processes, both of which are modulated by cell-to-cell crowding effects.  Previous discrete models of two-dimensional collective cell migration assays involve a nearest-neighbour proliferation mechanism where crowding effects are incorporated by aborting potential proliferation events if the randomly chosen target site is occupied. There are two potential limitations of this traditional approach: (i) it seems unreasonable to abort a potential proliferation event based on the occupancy of a single, randomly chosen target site; and, (ii) the continuum limit description of this mechanism leads to the standard logistic growth function, but there is increasing evidence suggesting that cells do not always grow logistically.  Motivated by these limitations we introduce a generalised proliferation mechanism into a two-dimensional lattice-based exclusion process model, which allows non-nearest neighbour proliferation events to take place over a template of <em>r</em> \u2265 1 concentric rings of  lattice sites. Further,  the decision to abort potential proliferation events is made using a <em>crowding function</em>, <em>f</em>(<em>C</em>) \u2208 [0,1] with <em>f</em>(0) = 1 and <em>f</em>(1) = 0.  This approach accounts for the density of agents within a group of lattice sites rather than dealing with the occupancy of a single site only.  Analysing the continuum limit description of the stochastic model shows that the standard logistic source term, \u03bb<em>C</em> (1 \u2212 <em>C</em>), where \u03bb is the proliferation rate, is generalised to a universal growth function, <em>\u03bb</em>C<em>f</em>(<em>C</em>).  Comparing the solution of the continuum description with averaged simulation data indicates that the continuum model performs well for many choices of <em>f</em>(<em>C</em>) and <em>r</em>.  For nonlinear <em>f</em>(<em>C</em>), the quality of the continuum-discrete match increases with <em>r</em>.  Therefore, we suggest that estimating <em>r</em> from time lapse images will help distinguish between situations where the simpler continuum model is adequate from other situations where repeated simulations of the stochastic algorithm is required.', u'/content/early/2016/05/16/052969', [], [u'Queensland University of Technology']]
[u'gmos: Rapid detection of genome mosaicism over short evolutionary distances', ['Mirjana Domazet-Loso', 'Tomislav Domazet-Loso'], u'May 16, 2016.', u'Prokaryotic and viral genomes are often altered by recombination and horizontal gene transfer. The existing methods for detecting recombination are primarily aimed at viral genomes or sets of loci, since the expensive computation of underlying statistical models often hinders the comparison of complete prokaryotic genomes. As an alternative, alignment-free solutions are more efficient, but cannot map (align) a query to subject genomes. To address this problem, we have developed gmos (Genome MOsaic Structure), a new program that determines the mosaic structure of query genomes when compared to a set of closely related subject genomes. The program first computes local alignments between query and subject genomes and then reconstructs the query mosaic structure by choosing the best local alignment for each query region. To accomplish the analysis quickly, the program mostly relies on pairwise alignments and constructs multiple sequence alignments over short overlapping subject regions only when necessary. This fine-tuned implementation achieves an efficiency comparable to an alignment-free tool. The program performs well for simulated and real data sets of closely related genomes and can be used for fast recombination detection; for instance, when a new prokaryotic pathogen is discovered. As an example, gmos was used to detect genome mosaicism in a pathogenic Enterococcus faecium strain compared to seven closely related genomes. The analysis took less than two minutes on a single 2.1 GHz processor. The output is available in fasta format and can be visualized using an accessory program, gmosDraw (freely available with gmos).', u'/content/early/2016/05/16/053694', [], [u'University of Zagreb Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing;', u'Ru\u0111er Boskovi\u0107 Institute']]
[u'Markov models of the apo-MDM2 lid region reveal diffuse yet two-state binding dynamics and receptor poses for computational docking', ['Sudipto Mukherjee', 'George A Pantelopulos', 'Vincent A Voelz'], u'May 16, 2016.', u'MDM2 is a negative regulator of p53 activity and an important target for cancer therapeutics.  The N-terminal lid region of MDM2 modulates interactions with p53 via competition for its binding cleft, exchanging slowly between docked and undocked conformations in the absence of p53. To better understand these dynamics, we constructed Markov State Models (MSMs) from large collections of unbiased simulation trajectories of apo-MDM2, and find strong evidence for diffuse, yet two-state folding and binding of the N-terminal region to the p53 receptor site. The MSM also identifies holo-like receptor conformations highly suitable for computational docking, despite initiating trajectories from closed-cleft receptor structures unsuitable for docking.  Fixed-anchor docking studies using a test set of high-affinity small molecules and peptides show simulated receptor ensembles achieve docking successes comparable to cross-docking studies using crystal structures of receptors bound by alternative ligands. For p53, the best-scoring receptor structures have the N-terminal region lid region bound in a helical conformation mimicking the bound structure of p53, suggesting lid region association induces receptor conformations suitable for binding. These results suggest that MD+MSM approaches can sample binding-competent receptor conformations suitable for computational peptidomimetic design, and that inclusion of disordered regions may be essential to capturing the correct receptor dynamics.', u'/content/early/2016/05/16/053603', [], [u'Temple University']]

Cassava brown streak disease (CBSD), is caused by Cassava brown streak virus (CBSV) and Ugandan cassava brown streak virus (UCBSV) is suppressing cassava yields in East Africa at an alarming rate. Previous studies have documented CBSV is more devastating than UCBSV. This is because CBSV is harder to breed resistance for, causes more infections and yield losses in cassava, and its species delimitation is more challenging.  We set out to characterize the CBSV and UCBSV whole genomes from the 26 previously published genomes and three new from Uganda, using NGS data with the goal of uncovering genetic patterns that explain the observed biological differences. In this paper, we report phylogenetic relationships, rates of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions, and whole genome-based evolutionary rates for CBSV and UCBSV. Using the whole genome sequences we produced the first coalescent based species tree estimation for CBSV and UCBSV which supports previously published studies pointing to multiple species of both CBSV and UCBSV. This new species framework led to the finding that CBSV has a faster rate of evolution when compared with UCBSV. The genes responsible for CBSVs rapid rate of evolution are NIa, 6K2, NIb and P1. Furthermore, we have discovered that for CBSV, rates of nonsynonomous substitutions are more predominant than synonymous substitution and occur across the entire genome. All comparative analyses between CBSV and UCBSV presented suggests CBSV is outsmarting the cassava immune system, thus is more devastating and harder to control.', u'/content/early/2016/05/16/053546', [], [u'National Crops Resources Research Institute;', u'Mikocheni Agricultural Research Institute;', u'The Ohio State University;', u'DAFWA;', u'The University of Western Australia']]

The accuracy evaluation using Illumina-like simulated reads showed that accuracy varies by read length, but overall BWA aln was most accurate, followed by BWA mem and Bowtie2. BWA mem was most accurate with Ion Torrent-like read sets. STAR was at least 5 fold faster than Bowtie2 or BWA mem.

The F36M substitution, in which Phe36 in the ligand-binding pocket is changed to Met, leads to formation of antiparallel FKBP dimers, which can be dissociated into monomers by ligand binding. This FKBP(M) mutant has been employed in the mammalian secretory pathway to generate aggregates that can be dissolved by ligand addition to create cargo waves. However, when testing this approach in yeast, we found that dissolution of FKBP(M) aggregates was inefficient. An improved reversibly dimerizing FKBP formed aggregates that dissolved more readily. This FKBP(L,V) mutant carries the F36L mutation, which increases the affinity of ligand binding, and the I90V mutation, which accelerates ligand-induced dissociation of the dimers.

[u'Dopamine neurons change the type of excitability in response to stimuli', ['Ekaterina Morozova', 'Denis Zakharov', 'Boris Gutkin', 'Christopher Lapish', 'Alexey Kuznetsov'], u'May 16, 2016.', u'The dynamics of neural excitability determine the neuronal response to stimuli, its synchronization and resonance properties and, ultimately, the computations it performs in the brain. We investigated the dynamical mechanisms underlying the excitability type of dopamine (DA) neurons, using a conductance based biophysical model, and its regulation by intrinsic and synaptic currents. By calibrating the model to reproduce low frequency tonic firing, NMDA excitation is balanced by GABA-mediated inhibition and leads to type I excitable behavior characterized by a continuous decrease in firing frequency in response to hyperpolarizing currents. Furthermore, we analyzed how excitability type of the DA neuron model is influenced by changes in the intrinsic current composition. A subthreshold sodium current is necessary for a continuous frequency decrease during application of a negative current, and the low-frequency balanced state during simultaneous activation of NMDA and GABA receptors. Blocking this current switches the neuron to type II. Enhancing the anomalous rectifier Ih current also switches the excitability to type II. Key characteristics of synaptic conductances that may be observed in vivo also change the type of excitability: a depolarized GABAR reversal potential or co-activation of AMPARs leads to an abrupt frequency drop to zero, which is typical for type II excitability. Coactivation of NMDARs together with AMPARs and GABARs shifts the the type I/II boundary toward more hyperpolarized GABAR reversal potentials. To better understand how altering each of the aforementioned currents leads to changes in excitability profile of DA neuron, we provide a thorough dynamical analysis. Collectively, these results imply that type I excitability in dopamine neurons might be important for low firing rates and fine-tuning basal dopamine levels, while switching excitability to type II during NMDAR and AMPAR activation may facilitate a transient increase in dopamine concentration, as type II neurons are more amenable to synchronization.', u'/content/early/2016/05/16/053637', [], [u'Indiana University;', u'Institute of Applied Physics;', u'Ecole Normale Superieure PSL University;', u'Indiana University - Purdue University']]

The introduction of ABHR and hand hygiene to Australian hospitals from 2002 has been associated with a decrease in Staphylococcus aureus infections.  However, this decrease has been paralleled by a nationwide increase in vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE Efm) infections. Here, we tested the hypothesis that recent clinical isolates of Efm are more tolerant than stored historical isolates to the alcohols now used extensively in hospital hand hygiene programs.\nMethods: We studied 77 stored clinical isolates of Efm, 66 randomly selected by year from our hospital over 18 years (1998-2015), and 11 obtained recently from other Australian hospitals with sequence types not encountered locally. We measured log10 reduction in colony forming units after five minutes exposure to isopropyl alcohol, stratified by year of isolation and multi-locus sequence type.\nResults: There was a highly significant increase in Efm alcohol tolerance over time observed across all sequence types tested in this assay, with differences of up to 4.6 log10 kill at five minutes between invasive isolates from 1998 compared to those from 2015 (log10 reduction after alcohol exposure by year of isolation; Spearman Rank r = 0.43, p < 0.0004).\nConclusions: Recent isolates of Efm obtained from bloodstream infections were significantly more tolerant to alcohol than the earliest isolates tested. The progressive gain in alcohol tolerance partly explains the failure of standard precautions that rely on alcohol-based hand rubs to control VRE cross-transmission.', u'/content/early/2016/05/16/053728', [], [u'University of Melbourne;', u'Austin Health;', u'Murdoch University']]

According to the current consensus, erroneously active parallel fibre synapses are depressed by complex spikes arising as climbing fibres signal movement errors. However, this theory cannot solve the credit assignment problem of using the limited information from a global movement evaluation to optimise behaviour by guiding the plasticity in numerous neurones. We identify the possible implementation of an algorithm solving this problem, whereby spontaneous complex spikes perturb ongoing movements, create an eligibility trace for plasticity and signal resulting error changes to guide plasticity. These error changes are extracted by adaptively cancelling the average error. This framework, stochastic gradient descent with estimated global errors, generates specific predictions for synaptic plasticity rules that contradict the current consensus.  However, in vitro plasticity experiments under physiological conditions verified our predictions, highlighting the sensitivity of plasticity studies to unphysiological conditions. Using numerical and analytical approaches we demonstrate the convergence and estimate the capacity of learning in our implementation.

However, deleterious alleles segregate in the human population and some disease-associated variants are maintained at considerable frequencies. Here we test the hypothesis that balancing selection may counteract purifying selection in neighboring regions and thus maintain deleterious variants at higher frequency than expected from their detrimental fitness effect. We first show in realistic simulations that balancing selection reduces the density of polymorphic sites surrounding a locus under balancing selection, but at the same time markedly increases the population frequency of the remaining variants, including even substantially deleterious alleles. To validate our simulation results empirically, we then use whole exome sequencing data from 6,500 human individuals and focus on the most established example for balancing selection in the human genome, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Our analysis shows an elevated frequency of putatively deleterious coding variants in non-HLA genes localized in the MHC region. The mean frequency of these variants declined with physical distance from the classical HLA genes, indicating dependency on genetic linkage. These results reveal an indirect cost of the genetic diversity maintained by balancing selection, which has hitherto been perceived as mostly advantageous, and have implications both for the evolution of recombination and also for the epidemiology of various MHC-associated diseases.', u'/content/early/2016/05/16/053793', [], [u'Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology;', u"Brigham & Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School"]]

Due to their sheer size, these jackpot events, first discovered by Luria and Delbrueck, are thought to have momentous roles in short-term evolutionary processes, including the adaptation from standing variation, evolutionary rescue, drug resistance evolution, and the somatic evolution of genetic diseases. However, because the emergence of jackpot events has been understood only in uniformly growing populations, it is currently impossible to predict their impact on the evolution of many naturally structured populations. To study jackpot events in spatially structured populations, we tracked mutant clones in microbial populations using fluorescent microscopy and population sequencing. High-frequency mutations were massively enriched in microbial colonies compared to well-shaken liquid cultures, as a result of late-occurring mutations surfing at the edge of range expansions. We provide a mathematical theory that explains the observed excess of jackpot events and predicts their role in promoting rare evolutionary outcomes. In particular, we show that resistant clones generated by surfing can become unleashed under high selection pressures, and thus represent a drug resistance hazard for high-dose drug treatments. An excess of mutational jackpot events is shown to be a general consequence of non-uniform growth and, therefore, could be relevant to the mutational load of developing biofilm communities, solid tumors and multi-cellular organisms.', u'/content/early/2016/05/16/053405', [u'Evolutionary Biology'], [u'UC Berkeley;', u'University of California, Berkeley']]

In recent work, we have suggested a direct and primary role for bacterial lipopolysaccharide in this hypercoagulability, but it seems never to have been tested directly. Here we show that the addition of tiny concentrations (0.2 ng.L-1) of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to both whole blood and platelet-poor plasma of normal, healthy donors leads to marked changes in the nature of the fibrin fibres so formed, as observed by ultrastructural and fluorescence microscopy (the latter implying that the fibrin is actually in an amyloid \u03b2-sheet-rich form.  They resemble those seen in a number of inflammatory (and also amyloid) diseases, consistent with an involvement of LPS in their aetiology. These changes are mirrored by changes in their viscoelastic properties as measured by thromboelastography. Since the terminal stages of coagulation involve the polymerisation of fibrinogen into fibrin fibres, we tested whether LPS would bind to fibrinogen directly. We demonstrated this using isothermal calorimetry.  Finally, we show that these changes in fibre structure are mirrored when the experiment is done simply with purified fibrinogen and thrombin (\xb1 0.2 ng.L-1 LPS). This ratio of concentrations of LPS:fibrinogen in vivo represents a molecular amplification by the LPS of more than 108-fold, a number that is probably unparalleled in biology. The observation of a direct effect of such highly substoichiometric amounts of LPS on both fibrinogen and coagulation can account for the role of very small numbers of dormant bacteria in disease progression, and opens up this process to further mechanistic analysis and possible treatment.', u'/content/early/2016/05/16/053538', [u'Microbiology'], [u'University of Pretoria;', u'University of Pretoris;', u'The University of Manchester']]
