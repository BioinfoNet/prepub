While this effect is limited to the local genomic region of the sweep in panmictic populations, we find that in spatially-extended populations the combined effects of many unlinked sweeps can affect patterns of ancestry (and therefore neutral genetic diversity) across the whole genome. Even low rates of sweeps can be enough to skew the spatial locations of ancestors such that neutral mutations that occur in individuals living outside a small region in the center of the range have virtually no chance of fixing in the population.', u'/content/early/2016/10/30/084426', [], [u'Emory University']]
[u'Level-Based Analysis of Genetic Algorithms and Other Search Processes', ['Dogan Corus', 'Duc-Cuong Dang', 'Anton Eremeev', 'Per Kristian Lehre'], u'October 30, 2016.', u'Understanding how the time-complexity of evolutionary algorithms\n(EAs) depend on their parameter settings and characteristics of\nfitness landscapes is a fundamental problem in evolutionary\ncomputation.

However, since few\nof these techniques apply effortlessly to population-based EAs, most\ntime-complexity results concern simplified EAs, such as the (1+1) EA.\n\nThis paper describes the \\emph{level-based theorem}, a new technique\ntailored to population-based processes.

[u"Single-cell entropy for quantification of differentiation potency from a cell's transcriptome", ['Andrew E Teschendorff'], u'October 30, 2016.', u'The ability to quantify differentiation potential of single cells is a task of critical importance for single-cell studies. So far however, there is no robust general molecular correlate of differentiation potential at the single cell level. Here we show that\ndifferentiation potency of a single cell can be approximated by computing the signaling promiscuity, or entropy, of a cells transcriptomic profile in the context of a cellular interaction network, without the need for model training or feature selection. We\nvalidate signaling entropy in over 7,000 single cell RNA-Seq profiles, representing all main differentiation stages, including time-course data. We develop a novel algorithm called Single Cell Entropy (SCENT), which correctly identifies known cell\nsubpopulations of varying potency, enabling reconstruction of cell-lineage trajectories.\nBy comparing bulk to single cell data, SCENT reveals that expression heterogeneity within single cell populations is regulated, pointing towards the importance of cell-cell interactions. In the context of cancer, SCENT can identify drug resistant cancer\nstem-cell phenotypes, including those obtained from circulating tumor cells. In summary, SCENT can directly estimate the differentiation potency and plasticity of single-cells, allowing unbiased quantification of intercellular heterogeneity, and\nproviding a means to identify normal and cancer stem cell phenotypes.', u'/content/early/2016/10/30/084202', [u'Systems Biology'], [u'University College London + CAS-MPG Partner Institute for Computational Biology']]

Sanders', 'Yi Hu', 'Corrie Moreau', 'Daniel Kronauer', "Sean O'Donnell", 'Ryuichi Koga', 'Jacob A. Russell'], u'October 30, 2016.', u'Symbiotic bacteria play important roles in the biology of their arthropod hosts. Yet the microbiota of many diverse and influential groups remain understudied, resulting in a paucity of information on the fidelities and histories of these associations. Motivated by prior findings from a smaller scale, 16S rRNA-based study, we conducted a broad phylogenetic and geographical survey of microbial communities in the ecologically dominant New World army ants (Formicidae: Dorylinae). Amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene across 28 species spanning the five New World genera showed that the microbial communities of army ants consist of very few common and abundant bacterial species. The two most abundant microbes, referred to as Unclassified Firmicutes and Unclassified Entomoplasmatales, appear to be specialized army ant associates that dominate microbial communities in the gut lumen of three host genera, Eciton, Labidus and Nomamyrmex. Both are present in other army ant genera, including those from the Old World, suggesting that army ant symbioses date back to the Cretaceous. Extensive sequencing of bacterial protein-coding genes revealed multiple strains of these symbionts co-existing within colonies, but seldom within the same individual ant. Bacterial strains formed multiple host species-specific lineages on phylogenies, which often grouped strains from distant geographic locations. These patterns deviate from those seen in other social insects, and raise intriguing questions about the influence of army ant colony swarm-founding and within-colony genetic diversity on strain co-existence, and the effects of hosting a diverse suite of symbiont strains on colony ecology.', u'/content/early/2016/10/30/084376', [u'Evolutionary Biology'], [u'Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, U.S.A.;', u'Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, U.S.A.;', u'Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago, IL, U.S.A.;', u'Rockefeller University, New York, NY, U.S.A.;', u'National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Japan']]
[u'Interplay of Driver, Mini-Driver, and Deleterious Passenger Mutations on Cancer Progression', ['Xin Li', 'Dave Thirumalai'], u'October 30, 2016.', u'Cancer is caused by the accumulation of a critical number of somatic mutations (drivers) that offer fitness advantage to tumor cells. Moderately deleterious passengers, suppressing cancer progression, and mini-drivers, mildly beneficial to tumors, can profoundly alter the cancer evolutionary landscape. This observation prompted us to develop a stochastic evolutionary model intended to probe the interplay of drivers, mini-drivers and deleterious passengers in tumor growth over a broad range of fitness values and mutation rates. Below a (small) threshold number of drivers tumor growth exhibits a plateau (dormancy) with large burst occurring when a driver achieves fixation, reminiscent of intermittency in dissipative dynamical systems. The predictions of the model, in particular the relationship between the average number of passenger mutations versus drivers in a tumor, is in accord with clinical data on several cancers. When deleterious drivers are included, we predict a non-monotonic growth of tumors as the mutation rate is varied with shrinkage and even reversal occurring at very large mutation rates. This surprising finding explains the paradoxical observation that high chromosomal instability (CIN) correlates with improved prognosis in a number of cancers compared with intermediate CIN.', u'/content/early/2016/10/30/084392', [u'Cancer Biology'], [u'University of Texas at Austin']]
[u'Phosphorylation energy and nonlinear kinetics as key determinants for G2/M transition in fission yeast cell cycle', ['Teng Wang', 'Jian Zhao', 'Qi Ouyang', 'Hong Qian', 'Yu V. Fu', 'Fangting Li'], u'October 30, 2016.', u'The living cell is an open nonequilibrium biochemical system, where ATP hydrolysis serves as the energy source for a wide range of intracellular processes including the assurance for decision-making. In the fission yeast cell cycle, the transition from G2 phase to M phase is triggered by the activation of Cdc13/Cdc2 and Cdc25, and the deactivation of Wee1. Each of these three events involves a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation (PdP) cycle, and together they form a regulatory circuit with feedback loops. Almost all quantitative models for cellular networks in the past have invalid thermodynamics due to the assumption of irreversible enzyme kinetics. We constructed a thermodynamically realistic kinetic model of the G2/M circuit, and show that the phosphorylation energy (\u0394G ), which is determined by the cellular ATP/ADP ratio, critically controls the dynamics and the bistable nature of Cdc2 activation. Using fission yeast nucleoplasmic extract (YNPE), we are able to experimentally verify our model prediction that increased , being synergistic to the accumulation of Cdc13, drives the activation of Cdc2. Furthermore, Cdc2 activation exhibits bistability and hysteresis in response to changes in phosphorylation energy. These findings suggest that adequate maintenance of phosphorylation energy ensures the bistability and robustness of the activation of Cdc2 in the G2/M transition. Free energy might play a widespread role in biological decision-making processes, connecting thermodynamics with information processing in biology.', u'/content/early/2016/10/30/084400', [u'Systems Biology'], [u'School of Physics, Center for Quantitative Biology, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China;', u'State Key Laboratory of Microbial Resources, Institute Of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences,;', u'Department of Applied Mathematics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195, U.S.A.']]
[u'Rapid evolution of the human mutation spectrum', ['Kelley Harris', 'Jonathan Pritchard'], u'October 30, 2016.', u'DNA is a remarkably precise medium for copying and storing biological information, with a mutation rate in humans of about 1e-8 per base pair per generation. This extraordinary fidelity results from the combined action of hundreds of genes involved in DNA replication and proofreading, and repair of spontaneous damage. Recent studies of cancer have shown that mutation of specific genes often leads to characteristic mutational "signatures"--i.e., increased mutation rates within particular sequence contexts. We therefore hypothesized that more subtle variation in replication or repair genes within natural populations might also lead to differences in mutational signatures. As a proxy for mutational input, we examined SNV variation across human and other great ape populations. Remarkably we found that mutational spectra differ substantially among species, human continental groups and even, in some cases, between closely-related populations. Closer examination of one such signal, an increased rate of TCC->TTC mutations reported previously in Europeans, indicates a burst of mutations from about 15,000 to 2,000 years ago, perhaps due to the appearance, drift, and ultimate elimination of a genetic modifier of mutation rate.', u'/content/early/2016/10/30/084343', [u'Evolutionary Biology'], [u'Stanford University']]
[u'Arabidopsis MADS-box transcription factor AGL21 acts as environmental surveillance for seed germination by regulating ABI5', ['Chengbin Xiang', 'Lin-Hui Yu', 'Jie Wu', 'Zi-Qing Miao', 'Ping-Xia Zhao', 'Zhen Wang'], u'October 30, 2016.', u'Seed germination is a crucial checkpoint for plant survival under unfavorable environmental conditions. Abscisic acid (ABA) and its signaling play a vital role in integrating environmental information to regulate seed germination. MCM1/AGAMOUS/DEFICIENS/SRF (MADS)-box transcription factors are mainly known as key regulators of seed and flower development in Arabidopsis. However, their functions in seed germination are still poorly understood. Here we report that MADS-box transcription factor AGL21 negatively modulates seed germination and post-germination growth by controlling the expression of ABA-INSENSITIVE 5 (ABI5) in Arabidopsis. AGL21 responds to multiple environmental stresses and plant hormones. The AGL21-overexpressing plants are hypersensitive to ABA, salt and osmotic stresses during seed germination and early post-germination growth, whereas agl21 mutants are less sensitive. AGL21 positively regulates ABI5 expression in seeds. Genetic analyses reveal that AGL21 is epistatic to ABI5 in controlling seed germination. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays further demonstrate that AGL21 could directly bind to the ABI5 promoter in plant cells. Taken together, our results suggest that AGL21 acts as a surveillance integrator that incorporates environmental cues and endogenous hormonal signals into ABA signaling to regulate seed germination and early post-germination growth.', u'/content/early/2016/10/30/082164', [u'Plant Biology'], [u'School of Life Sciences, USTC']]

Hence, we aim to identify non-polio enteroviruses recovered from the faeces of children diagnosed with AFP in Nigeria.\n\nMethods: Ninety-six isolates, (95 unidentified and one previously confirmed Sabin poliovirus 3) recovered on RD cell culture from the stool of children <15 years old diagnosed with AFP in 2014 were analyzed. All isolates were subjected to RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and three different PCR reactions (one panenterovirus 5-UTR and two VP1 amplification assays). VP1 amplicons were then sequenced isolates identified.\n\nResults:  93.75% (90/96) of the isolates were detected by at least one of the three assays as an enterovirus. Precisely, 79.17% (76/96), 6.25% (6/96), 7.295% (7/96) and 6.25% (6/96) of the isolates were positive for both, positive and negative, negative and positive, as well as negative for both the 5-UTR and VP1 assays, respectively. In this study, sixty-nine (69) of the 83 VP1 amplicons sequenced were identified as 27 different enterovirus types. The most commonly detected were CV-B3 (10 isolates) and EV-B75 (5 isolates). Specifically, one, twenty-four and two of the enterovirus types identified in this study belong to EV-A, EV-B and EV-C respectively.\n\nDiscussion: This study reports the circulating strains of 27 non-polio enterovirus types in Nigerian children with AFP in 2014 and Nigerian strains of CV-B2, CV-B4, E17, EV-B80, EV-B73, EV-B97, EV-B93, EV-C99 and EV-A120.', u'/content/early/2016/10/30/084350', [u'Epidemiology'], [u'Ekiti State University;', u'University of Ibadan;', u'Obafemi Awolowo University;', u'Kings University']]
