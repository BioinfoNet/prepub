[u'Sociality and DNA methylation are not evolutionary dependent', ['Adam J Bewick', 'Kevin J Vogel', 'Allen J Moore', 'Robert J Schmitz'], u'July 6, 2016.', u'Despite widespread conservation across the tree of life, little is known about how DNA methylation contributes to the evolution of complex traits. In particular, DNA methylation has been hypothesized to allow the evolution of highly flexible traits, such as sociality. We sought to better understand patterns of DNA methylation and its association between the expression of advanced social behavior across insects. DNA methylation in insects is widespread and found in social and solitary species from all orders, except Diptera (flies). Solitary species within Blattodea (cockroaches, termites) had the highest levels of DNA methylation. The presence/absence of underlying methyltransferases corroborates most patterns observed, but alternative DNA methylation pathways may exist. Furthermore, we found no evidence that supports evolutionary dependency between either advanced social behavior or division of labor and DNA methylation within insects using phylogenetically corrected comparisons. These results suggest that DNA methylation is not the driver of social behavior.', u'/content/early/2016/07/06/062455', [], [u'University of Georgia']]

Amorphous aggregation of \u03b3-crystallins in the eye lens causes a widespread disease of aging, cataract. We combined simulations and experiments to study the mechanism of aggregation of two \u03b3D-crystallin mutants, W42R and W42Q - the former a congenital cataract mutation, and the latter a mimic of age-related oxidative damage. We found that formation of an internal disulfide was necessary and sufficient for aggregation under physiological conditions. Two-chain all-atom simulations predicted that one non-native disulfide in particular, between Cys32 and Cys41, was likely to stabilize an unfolding intermediate prone to intermolecular interactions. Mass spectrometry and mutagenesis experiments confirmed the presence of this bond in the aggregates and its necessity for oxidative aggregation under physiological conditions in vitro. Mining the simulation data linked formation of this disulfide to extrusion of the N-terminal \u03b2-hairpin and rearrangement of the native \u03b2-sheet topology. Specific binding between the extruded hairpin and a distal \u03b2-sheet, in an intermolecular chain reaction similar to domain swapping, is the most probable mechanism of aggregate propagation.', u'/content/early/2016/07/06/062430', [], [u'MIT;', u'Harvard']]

ZIKV spread from Africa to Pacific and South American territories, emerging as an etiological pathogen of neurological disorders, during fetal development and in adulthood. Therefore, antiviral drugs able to inhibit ZIKV replication are necessary. Broad spectrum antivirals, such as interferon, ribavirin and favipiravir, are harmful for pregnant animal models and women. The clinically approved uridine nucleotide analog anti-HCV drug, sofosbuvir, has not been affiliated to teratogenicity. Sofosbuvir target the most conserved protein over the members of the Flaviviridae family, the viral RNA polymerase. We thus studied ZIKV susceptibility to sofosbovir. We initially characterized a Brazilian ZIKV strain for use in experimental assays. Sofosbuvir inhibits the Brazilian ZIKV replication in a dose-dependent manner, both in BHK-21 cells and SH-Sy5y, by targeting ZIKV RNA polymerase activity, with the involvement of conserved amino acid residues over the members of Flaviviridae family. The identification of clinically approved antiviral drugs endowed with anti-ZIKV could reduce the time frame in pre-clinical development. Altogether, our data indicates that sofosbuvir chemical structure is endowed with anti-ZIKV activity.', u'/content/early/2016/07/06/061671', [], [u'Fiocruz;', u'UFRJ;', u'BMK consortium;', u'Oswaldo Cruz Foundation']]
[u'Primate ventromedial prefrontal cortex neurons continuously encode the willingness to engage in reward directed behavior.', ['Aurore San Galli', 'Chiara Varazzani', 'Raphaelle Abitbol', 'Mathias Pessiglione', 'Sebastien Bouret'], u'July 6, 2016.', u'To survive in their complex environment, primates must integrate information over time and adjust their actions beyond immediate events. The underlying neurobiological processes, however, remain unclear. Here, we assessed the contribution of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), a brain region important for value-based decision making. We recorded single VMPFC neurons in monkeys performing a task where obtaining fluid rewards required squeezing a grip. The willingness to perform the action was modulated not only by visual information about Effort and Reward levels, but also by contextual factors such as Trial Number (i.e fatigue and/or satiety) or behavior in recent trials. A greater fraction of VMPFC neurons encoded contextual information, compared to visual stimuli. Moreover, the dynamics of VMPFC firing was more closely related to slow changes in motivational states driven by these contextual factors rather than rapid responses to individual task events. Thus, the firing of VMPFC neurons continuously integrated contextual information and reliably predicted the monkeys willingness to perform the task. This function might be critical when animals forage in a complex environment and need to integrate information over time. Its relation with motivational states also resonates with the VMPFC implication in the default mode or in mood disorders.', u'/content/early/2016/07/06/062315', [u'Neuroscience'], [u'INSERM;', u'ICM;', u'CNRS']]
[u'Should tissue structure suppress or amplify selection to minimize cancer risk?', ['Laura Hindersin', 'Benjamin Werner', 'David Dingli', 'Arne Traulsen'], u'July 6, 2016.', u'It has been frequently argued that tissues evolved to suppress the accumulation\nof growth enhancing cancer inducing mutations. \nA prominent example is the hierarchical structure of tissues with high cell turnover, where a small number of tissue specific stem cells produces a large number of specialised progeny during multiple differentiation steps. \nAnother well known mechanism is the spatial organisation of stem cell populations and it is thought that this organisation suppresses fitness enhancing mutations.  \nHowever, in small populations the suppression of advantageous mutations typically also implies an increased accumulation of deleterious mutations.  \nThus, it becomes an important question whether the suppression of potentially few advantageous mutations outweighs the combined effects of many deleterious mutations.  \nWe argue that the distribution of mutant fitness effects, e.g. the probability to hit a strong driver compared to many deleterious mutations, is crucial for the optimal organisation of a cancer suppressing tissue architecture and should\nbe taken into account in arguments for the evolution of such tissues. \nWe show that for systems that are composed of few cells reflecting the typical organisation of a stem cell niche, amplification or suppression of selection can arise from subtle changes in the architecture. \nMoreover, we discuss special tissue structures that can suppress most types of non-neutral mutations simultaneously.', u'/content/early/2016/07/06/062356', [u'Evolutionary Biology'], [u'Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology, August-Thienemann-Str. 2, 24306 Ploen, German;', u'The Centre for Evolution and Cancer, The Institute of Cancer Research, 123 Old Brompton Road, London;', u'Division of Hematology and Department of Molecular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, 200 First Street SW, Roche;', u'MPI Evolutionary Biology']]

Despite the large variability between trials during naturalistic stimulation, we replicated previous findings from the literature: frequency, animacy, word order.

Research identified factors required for axonal regeneration outside the CNS, but little is known about regeneration triggered by dendrotomy. To determine how neurons regenerate dendrites following injury we study the C. elegans PVD polymodal neurons that display an arborized pattern of repetitive menorah-like structures. We injure dendrites by laser microsurgery, follow their fate and show that broken primary dendrites often regenerate via fusion. We describe how PVD dendrites regenerate and present roles for EFF-1 and AFF-1 glycoproteins in fusion and remodeling of menorahs. Menorahs lose self-avoidance and AFF-1 fuses them, bypassing the injury site. Branch sprouting, EFF-1-mediated pruning, and arbor simplification completes regeneration. When auto-fusion fails the distal arbor degenerates. Surprisingly, AFF-1 acts non-cell autonomously to mediate dendrite fusion. We propose that extracellular vesicles derived from the lateral epidermis fuse severed dendrites in a process reminiscent of enveloped virus-mediated cell fusion without infection.', u'/content/early/2016/07/06/062372', [u'Neuroscience'], [u'Technion- Israel Institute of Technology']]
[u'Humans do not evidence choice biases in simple discrimination tasks', ['Daniel Linares', 'Joan Lopez-Moliner'], u'July 6, 2016.', u'Choice behavior in detection tasks demonstrates that perceptual decision-making not only depends on sensory evidence, but also on choice biases: the tendency to choose one alternative over the others independently of the sensory evidence. To assess whether choice biases pervade other perceptual decision scenarios, we asked humans to perform a simple common perceptual discrimination task with two symmetric alternatives. We found that participants did not choose the two alternatives equally often, which is consistent with the occurrence of choice biases, but also with the occurrence of sensory biases. To test these possibilities, participants performed the task reversing the mapping between perception and the category of the alternatives. With this simple manipulation, participants reversed the frequency of choosing the two alternatives, which supports that the biased choice behavior was caused by biased sensory evidence. Perceptual decision-making in simple tasks, thus, might be entirely based on the representation of sensory information.', u'/content/early/2016/07/06/062380', [u'Neuroscience'], [u'University of Barcelona']]

A conflict arises when several mutations are required for adaptation, but each mutation is separately deleterious. The process of a population evolving from a genotype encoding for a local fitness maximum to a higher fitness genotype is termed an adaptive peak shift.\nHere we suggest cooperative behavior as a factor that can facilitate adaptive peak shifts. We model cooperation in a public goods scenario, wherein each individual contributes resources that are later equally redistributed among all cooperating individuals. We use mathematical modeling and stochastic simulations to study the effect of cooperation on peak shifts in well-mixed populations and structured ones. Our results show that cooperation can accelerate the rate of complex adaptation. Furthermore, we show that cooperation increases the population diversity throughout the peak shift process, thus increasing the robustness of the population to drastic environmental changes. \nOur work could help explain adaptive valley crossing in natural populations and suggest that the long term evolution of a species depends on its social behavior.', u'/content/early/2016/07/06/062323', [u'Evolutionary Biology'], [u'Tel-Aviv University;', u'Tel Aviv University']]

However, these lethal concentrations may not be representative of the concentrations bacteria face in soil, a recognition that has lead to questions of the role of antibiotics in soil environments as well as the dynamics of resistance evolution during sub-lethal challenge. Here we examine the evolution of resistance to sub-MIC concentrations of streptomycin in the filamentous soil bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor. First, we show that spontaneous resistance to streptomycin causes an average fitness deficit of ~21% in the absence of drugs; however, these costs are eliminated at concentrations as low as 1/10 the MIC of susceptible strains. Using experimental evolution, we next show that resistance readily evolves at these non-lethal doses. More important, S. coelicolor resistance that evolves at sub-MIC streptomycin is cost-free. Whole-genome analyses reveal that sub-MIC evolved clones fix a distinct set of mutations to those isolated at high drug concentrations. Our results broaden the conditions under which resistance can evolve in nature and suggest that the long-term persistence of these strains is facilitated by the absence of pleiotropic fitness costs. Finally, our data cast doubt on arguments that low-concentration antibiotics in nature are signals, instead supporting models that resistance evolves in response to antibiotics used as weapons.', u'/content/early/2016/07/06/062414', [u'Evolutionary Biology'], [u'Leiden University']]
[u'Chaotic provinces in the kingdom of the Red Queen', ['Hanna Schenk', 'Arne Traulsen', 'Chaitanya S Gokhale'], u'July 6, 2016.', u'The interplay between parasites and their hosts is found in all kinds of species and plays an important role in understanding the principles of evolution and coevolution. Usually, the different genotypes of hosts and parasites oscillate in their abundances. The well-established theory of oscillatory Red Queen dynamics proposes an ongoing change in frequencies of the different types within each species. So far, it is unclear in which way Red Queen dynamics persists with more than two types of hosts and parasites. In our analysis, an arbitrary number of types within two species are examined in a deterministic framework with constant or changing population size. This general framework allows for analytical solutions for internal fixed points and their stability. For more than two species, apparently chaotic dynamics has been reported. Here we show that even for two species, once more than two types are considered per species, irregular dynamics in their frequencies can be observed in the long run. The nature of the dynamics depends strongly on the initial configuration of the system; the usual regular Red Queen oscillations are only observed in some parts of the parameter region.', u'/content/early/2016/07/06/062349', [u'Evolutionary Biology'], [u'Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology;', u'MPI Evolutionary Biology']]
