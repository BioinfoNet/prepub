[u'Enhancer sharing promotes neighborhoods of transcriptional regulation across eukaryotes', ['Porfirio Quintero-Cadena', 'Paul Sternberg'], u'June 28, 2016.', u'Enhancers physically interact with transcriptional promoters, looping over distances that can span multiple regulatory elements. Given that enhancer-promoter (EP) interactions generally occur via common protein complexes, it is unclear whether EP pairing is predominantly deterministic or proximity guided. Here we present cross-organismic evidence suggesting that most EP pairs are compatible, largely determined by physical proximity rather than specific interactions. By re-analyzing transcriptome datasets, we find that the transcription of gene neighbors is correlated over distances that scale with genome size. We experimentally show that non-specific EP interactions can explain such correlation, and that EP distance acts as a scaling factor for the transcriptional influence of an enhancer. We propose that enhancer sharing is commonplace among eukaryotes, and that EP distance is an important layer of information in gene regulation.', u'/content/early/2016/06/28/061218', [], [u'California Institute of Technology, United States']]

In many cases, these nucleases are engineered to induce a DNA double-strand break (DSB) to stimulate precise genome editing by homologous recombination (HR). However, HR efficiency is nearly always hindered by competing DSB repair pathways such as non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). HR is also profoundly suppressed in non-replicating cells, thus precluding the use of homology-based genome engineering in a wide variety of cell types. Here, we report the development of a genetically encoded inhibitor of 53BP1 (known as TP53BP1), a regulator of DSB repair pathway choice. 53BP1 promotes NHEJ over HR by suppressing end resection, the formation of 3-prime single-stranded DNA tails, which is the rate-limiting step in HR initiation. 53BP1 also blocks the recruitment of the HR factor BRCA1 to DSB sites in G1 cells. The inhibitor of 53BP1 (or i53) was identified through the screening of a massive combinatorial library of engineered ubiquitin variants by phage display. i53 binds and occludes the ligand binding site of the 53BP1 Tudor domain with high affinity and selectivity, blocking its ability to accumulate at sites of DNA damage. i53 is a potent selective inhibitor of 53BP1 and enhances gene targeting and chromosomal gene conversion, two HR-dependent reactions. Finally, i53 can also activate HR in G1 cells when combined with the activation of end-resection and KEAP1 inhibition. We conclude that 53BP1 inhibition is a robust tool to enhance precise genome editing by canonical HR pathways.', u'/content/early/2016/06/28/060954.1', [u'Molecular Biology'], [u'Mount Sinai Hospital;', u'University of Toronto;', u'Sinai Health Systems']]

Convenient histological clearing techniques, such as CLARITY, enable immunostaining and imaging of large volumes for 3D reconstruction. However, such clearing works by removing lipids and, as an unintended consequence, also removes lipophilic dyes. To remedy this wash-out, the molecular structure of the dye can be altered to adhere to both membranes and proteins so the dye remains in the tissue after lipid clearing. Nevertheless, the capacity of such modified dyes to remain in tissue has not yet been tested. Here, we test dyes with molecular modifications that make them aldehyde-fixable to proteins. We use three Dil-analogue dyes, CM DiI, SP DiI and FM 1 43FX that are modified to be CLARITY compatible candidates. We use the challenging adult, myelin-rich spinal cord tissue, which requires prolonged lipid clearing, of rats and mice.

EPNs are also interesting from the perspective of insect biocontrol.  Like other parasitic nematodes, EPNs employ a sophisticated chemosensory apparatus to detect potential hosts and communicate with conspecifics. Understanding the underlying molecular basis of relevant host-finding behaviours could facilitate improved EPN biocontrol approaches, and could lend insight to similar behaviours in economically important animal parasites. FMRFamide-like peptides are enriched and conserved across the Phylum Nematoda, and have been linked with motor and sensory function, including dispersal and aggregating behaviours in the free living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.  RNA interference (RNAi) was used to knockdown the expression of the FMRFamide-like protein 21 (GLGPRPLRFamide) gene (flp-21) in Steinernema carpocapsae infective juveniles (IJs). Our data show that S. carpocapsae is sensitive to neuronal RNAi, and that knockdown of flp-21 has a significant impact on dispersal, nictation and jumping behaviours.  Immunocytochemical localisation of FLP-21 to paired anterior neurons corroborates the RNAi data, further suggesting a role in sensory modulation.  This study represents the first demonstration of a functional RNAi pathway in S. carpocapsae, through which we have linked a single gene product to the coordination of nematode jumping, nictation, and dispersal behaviours in IJs.

[u'Consensus or deadlock? Consequences of simple behavioral rules for coordination in group decisions', ['Helen McCreery', 'Nikolaus Correll', 'Michael Breed', 'Samuel Flaxman'], u'June 28, 2016.', u'Coordinated collective behaviors often emerge from simple rules governing the interactions of individuals in groups. We model mechanisms of coordination among ants during cooperative transport, a challenging task that requires a consensus on travel direction. Decisions required for cooperative transport differ from other, well-studied consensus decisions because groups often deadlock, with individuals trying to move in opposing directions, and cooperative transport groups are often relatively small. Small groups may be more affected by individual nonconformity. Using deterministic and stochastic models, we investigate behavioral factors that affect deadlock duration. Our goal is to determine whether groups following simple behavioral rules can reach a consensus using minimal information. We define and investigate multiple types of behavioral rules that govern individual behavior and also differ in the information available. We find that if individuals more readily give up when they are going against the majority, groups rapidly break deadlocks. This occurs through positive and negative feedbacks that are implemented in our model via a single mechanism. We also find that to quickly reach a consensus, groups must have either a shared bias, high sensitivity to group behavior, or finely tuned persistence. While inspired by ants, our results are generalizable to other collective decisions with deadlocks, and demonstrate that groups of behaviorally simple individuals with no memory and extremely limited information can break symmetry and reach a consensus in a decision between two equal options.', u'/content/early/2016/06/28/061010', [u'Animal Behavior and Cognition'], [u'University of Colorado, Boulder']]
[u'Plant Chimeras: the good, the bad, and the Bizzaria', ['Margaret H Frank', 'Daniel H Chitwood'], u'June 28, 2016.', u'Chimeras, organisms that are composed of cells of more than one genotype, captured the human imagination long before they were formally described and used in the laboratory. These organisms owe their namesake to a fire-breathing monster from Greek mythology that has the head of a lion, the body of a goat, and the tail of a serpent. The first description of a non-fictional chimera dates back to the middle of the seventeenth century when the Florentine gardener Pietro Nati discovered an adventitious shoot growing from the graft junction between sour orange (Citrus aurantium) and citron (C. medica). This perplexing chimera that grows with sectors phenotypically resembling each of the citrus progenitors inspired discussion and wonder from the scientific community and was fittingly named the Bizzaria. Initially, the Bizzaria was believed to be an asexual hybrid that formed from a cellular fusion between the grafted parents; however, in-depth cellular analyses carried out centuries later demonstrated that the Bizzaria, along with other chimeras, owe their unique sectored appearance to a conglomeration of cells from the two donors. Since this pivotal discovery at the turn of the twentieth century, chimeras have served both as tools and as unique biological phenomena that have contributed to our understanding of plant development at the cellular, tissue, and organismal level. Rapid advancements in genome sequencing technologies have enabled the establishment of new model species with novel morphological and developmental features that enable the generation of chimeric organisms. In this review, we show that genetic mosaic and chimera studies provide a technologically simple way to delve into the organismal, genetic, and genomic inner workings underlying the development of diverse model organisms. Moreover, we discuss the unique opportunity that chimeras present to explore universal principles governing intercellular communication and the coordination of organismal biology in a heterogenomic landscape.', u'/content/early/2016/06/28/060715', [u'Plant Biology'], [u'Donald Danforth Plant Research Center;', u'Donald Danforth Plant Science Center']]
[u'Assessment of carbon dioxide, carbon dioxide/ oxygen, isoflurane and pentobarbital killing methods in rats.', ['Jessie Chisholm', 'Daniel Pang'], u'June 28, 2016.', u'Background:\nExposure to carbon dioxide (CO2) gas as a killing method is aversive and exposure to high concentrations likely to be painful. Bradycardia during exposure to CO2 is associated with nociception and pain. However, it is unclear if bradycardia occurs before loss of consciousness as this is variably defined in the literature. The objectives of this study were to explore the relationship between recumbency, loss of righting reflex (LORR) and a quiescent electromyograph as measures of loss of consciousness, and identify the onset of bradycardia in relation to these measures.\nMethods:\nThirty-two adult, female Sprague-Dawley rats were instrumented with a telemetry device and randomly assigned to one of four killing methods (100% CO2, CO2 (70%)/O2 (30%), isoflurane (5%) and intraperitoneal pentobarbital (200 mg/kg). Time to achieve recumbency, LORR, quiescent electromyograph, isoelectric electrocorticograph, heart rate and apnea were recorded.\nResults:\nThe general order of progression was recumbency, LORR, quiescent electromyograph, isoelectric electrocorticograph and apnea. Recumbency preceded LORR in the majority of animals (CO2; 7/8, CO2/O2; 8/8, isoflurane; 5/8, pentobarbital; 4/8). Bradycardia occurred before recumbency in the CO2 (p = 0.0002) and CO2/O2 (p = 0.005) groups, with a 50% reduction in heart rate compared to baseline. The slowest (time to apnea) and least consistent killing methods were CO2/O2 (1180 \xb1 658.1s) and pentobarbital (875 [239 to 4680]s).\nConclusion:\nBradycardia, and consequently nociception and pain, occurs before loss of consciousness during CO2 exposure.

Since then, rapid advances in sequencing technologies have led to a multitude of assemblies generated from complex genomes, although many of these are of a fragmented nature with a significant fraction of bases in gaps. The development of long-read sequencing and improved software enable the generation of more contiguous genome assemblies.\nResults: By combining data from Illumina, 454 and the longer PacBio sequencing technologies, as well as integrating the results of multiple assembly programs, we have created a substantially improved version of the Atlantic cod genome assembly. The sequence contiguity of this assembly has increased fifty-fold and the proportion of gap-bases has been reduced 15-fold. Compared to other vertebrates, the assembly contains an unusual high density of tandem repeats (TRs). Indeed, retrospective analyses reveal that gaps in the first genome assembly were largely associated with these TRs. We show that 21 % of the TRs across the assembly, 19 % in the promoter regions and 12 % in the coding sequences are heterozygous in the sequenced individual.\nConclusions: The use of multiple assembly programs combined with inclusion of PacBio reads drastically improved the Atlantic cod genome assembly by successfully resolving long TRs. The high frequency of heterozygous TRs within or in the vicinity of genes in the genome indicate a considerable standing genomic variation in Atlantic cod populations, which likely is of evolutionary importance.', u'/content/early/2016/06/27/060921', [u'Genomics'], [u'University of Oslo;', u'Norwegian University of Life Sciences;', u'J.

By transiently priming cells for commitment to different lineages, these fluctuations are thought to be important to the maintenance of, and exit from, pluripotency. However, since temporal changes in intracellular protein abundances cannot be measured directly in live cells, these fluctuations are typically assessed using genetically engineered reporter cell lines that produce a fluorescent signal as a proxy for protein expression. Here, using a combination of mathematical modeling and experiment, we show that there are unforeseen ways in which widely used reporter strategies can systemically disturb the dynamics they are intended to monitor, sometimes giving profoundly misleading results. In the case of Nanog we show how genetic reporters can compromise the behavior of important pluripotency-sustaining positive feedback loops, and induce a bifurcation in the underlying dynamics that gives rise to heterogeneous Nanog expression patterns in reporter cell lines that are not representative of the wild-type.

High-order statistics are critical for conveying local features, but they are challenging to study, largely because their number and variety is large.  Here, via the use of two-dimensional Hermite (TDH) functions, we identify a covert symmetry in high-order statistics of natural images that simplifies this task.  This emerges from the structure of TDH functions, which are an orthogonal set of functions that are organized into a hierarchy of ranks.  Specifically, we find that the shape (skewness and kurtosis) of the distribution of filter coefficients depends only on the projection of the function onto a 1-dimensional subspace specific to each rank.

Of the latter, a key problem is how to choose the most appropriate 'time zero' to use in longitudinal models, a choice which affects results. Rather than a  pre-specified 'time zero' we propose a novel methodology -- Temporal Clustering -- that defines a new `time zero' using individual offsets inferred from the data. We applied this to longitudinal Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), where this approach ensures that individuals have similar estimated MMSE scores at this new 'time zero'. Simulations showed that it could accurately predict cluster membership after the application of a filter. Next we applied it to a cohort of 2412 individuals, with large variability in MMSE score at first visit. Temporal Clustering was used to split individuals into two clusters. The group showing faster decline had higher average levels of AD risk factors: cerebrospinal fluid tau and APOE e4. Cluster membership predicted by Temporal Clustering was less affected by individuals' cognitive ability at first visit than was the case for clusters found using Latent Class Mixture Models.
