[u'Effects of plant evolution on nutrient cycling couple aboveground and belowground processes', ['Nicolas Loeuille', 'Tiphaine Le Mao', 'Sebastien Barot'], u'August 23, 2016.', u"Plant strategies for nutrient acquisition and recycling are key components of ecosystem functioning. How the evolution of such strategies modifies ecosystem functioning and services is still not well understood. In the present work, we aim at understanding how the evolution of different phenotypic traits link aboveground and belowground processes, thereby affecting the functioning of the ecosystem at different scales and in different realms. Using a simple model, we follow the dynamics of a limiting nutrient inside an ecosystem. Considering trade-offs between aboveground and belowground functional traits, we study the effects of the evolution of such strategies on ecosystem properties (amount of mineral nutrient, total plant biomass, dead organic matter and primary productivity) and whether such properties are maximized. Our results show that when evolution leads to a stable outcome, it minimizes the quantity of nutrient available (following Tilman's R* rule). We also show that considering the evolution of aboveground and belowground functional traits simultaneously, total plant biomass and primary productivity are not necessarily maximized through evolution. The coupling of aboveground and belowground processes through evolution may largely diminish predicted standing biomass and productivity (extinction may even occur), and impact the evolutionary resilience (ie, the return time to previous phenotypic states) of the ecosystem in face of external disturbances. We show that changes in plant biomass and their effects on evolutionary change can be understood by accounting for the links between nutrient uptake and mineralization, and for indirect effects of nutrient uptake on the amount of detritus in the system.", u'/content/early/2016/08/23/071126', [], [u'UPMC;', u'IRD']]

Historically limited to homicide investigations, the integration of full time forensic entomology services to the medical examiner's office in Harris County has opened up the opportunity to apply entomology to a wide variety of manner of death classifications and types of scenes to make observations on a number of different geographical and species-level trends in Harris County, Texas, USA. In this study, a retrospective analysis was made of 203 forensic entomology cases analyzed during the course of medicolegal death investigations performed by the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences in Houston, TX, USA from January 2013 through April 2016. These cases included all manner of death classifications, stages of decomposition and a variety of different scene types that were classified into decedents transported from the hospital (typically associated with myiasis or sting allergy; 3.0%), outdoor scenes (32.0%) or indoor scenes (65.0%). Ambient scene air temperature at the time scene investigation was the only significantly different factor observed between indoor and outdoor scenes with average indoor scene temperature being slightly cooler (25.2\xb0C) than that observed outdoors (28.0\xb0C). Relative humidity was not found to be significantly different between scene types. Most of the indoor scenes were classified as natural (43.3%) whereas most of the outdoor scenes were classified as homicides (12.3%). All other manner of death classifications came from both indoor and outdoor scenes. Several species were found to be significantly associated with indoor scenes as indicated by a binomial test, including Blaesoxipha plinthopyga (Sarcophagidae), all Sarcophagidae including B. plinthopyga, Megaselia scalaris (Phoridae), Synthesiomyia nudiseta (Muscidae) and Lucilia cuprina (Calliphoridae). The only species that was a significant indicator of an outdoor scene was Lucilia eximia (Calliphoridae). All other insect species that were collected in five or more cases were collected from both indoor and outdoor scenes. A species list with month of collection and basic scene characteristics with the length of the estimated time of colonization is also presented. The data presented here provide valuable casework related species data for Harris County, TX and nearby areas on the Gulf Coast that can be used to compare to other climate regions with other species assemblages and to assist in identifying new species introductions to the area.

In most cases, ancestry components are inferred correctly, although sample sizes and times since admixture can influence the inferences. Similarly, the popular Gaussian approximation tends to perform poorly when branch lengths are long, although the tree topology is correctly inferred in all scenarios explored.

The fact that researchers can infer similarities between neural representations, despite limitations in what fMRI measures, implies that certain neural coding schemes are more likely than others. For fMRI to be successful given its low temporal and spatial resolution, the neural code must smooth at the subvoxel and functional level such that similar stimuli engender similar internal representations. Through proof and simulation, we evaluate a number of reasonable coding schemes and demonstrate that only a subset are plausible given both fMRI's successes and its limitations in measuring neural activity. Deep neural network approaches, which have been forwarded as computational accounts of the ventral stream, are consistent with the success of fMRI, though functional smoothness breaks down in the later network layers.

While theoretical models have emphasized the importance of distinct biological factors, such as protein folding, back mutations, species complexity, and mutational robustness at determining the DFE, it remains unclear which of these models can describe the DFE in natural populations. Here, we show that the theoretical models make distinct predictions about how the DFE will differ between species. We further show that humans have a higher proportion of strongly deleterious mutations than Drosophila melanogaster. Comparing four categories of theoretical models, only Fisher's Geometrical Model (FGM) is consistent with our data. FGM assumes that multiple phenotypes are under stabilizing selection, with the number of phenotypes defining a complexity of the organism.

Often, new goals require updating conceptual knowledge to reflect relationships based on different goal-relevant features. Here, our aim is to determine how hippocampal (HPC) object representations are organized and updated to reflect changing conceptual knowledge. Participants learned two classification tasks in which successful learning required attention to different stimulus features, thus providing a means to index how representations of individual stimuli are reorganized according to changing task goals. We used a computational learning model to capture how people attended to goal-relevant features and organized object representations based on those features during learning. Using representational similarity analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging data, we demonstrate that neural representations in left anterior HPC correspond with model predictions of concept organization. Moreover, we show that during early learning, when concept updating is most consequential, HPC is functionally coupled with prefrontal regions. Based on these findings, we propose that when task goals change, object representations in HPC can be organized in new ways, resulting in updated concepts that highlight the features most critical to the new goal.', u'/content/early/2016/08/23/071118', [], [u'University of Texas at Austin;', u'University College London']]

Their activity results in the GalNAc \u03b11-O-Thr/Ser structure, termed the Tn antigen, which is further decorated with additional sugars. In neoplastic cells, the Tn antigen is often overexpressed. Because O-glycosylation is controlled by the activity of GalNAc-Ts, their regulation is of great interest. Previous reports suggest that growth factors, EGF or PDGF, induce Golgi complex-to-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) relocation of both GalNAc-Ts and Tn antigen in HeLa cells, offering a mechanism for Tn antigen overexpression termed \u2033GALA\u2033. However, we were unable to reproduce these findings.

How the rhythmic signaling pulse delivered by the Segmentation Clock is translated into the periodic morphogenesis of somites remains poorly understood. Here, we focused on the role of Paraxial protocadherin (PAPC/Pcdh8) in this process. We show that in chicken and mouse embryos, PAPC expression is tightly regulated by the Clock and Wavefront system in the posterior PSM. We observed that PAPC exhibits a striking complementary pattern to N-Cadherin (CDH2), marking the interface of the future somite boundary in the anterior PSM. Gain and loss of function of PAPC in chicken embryos disrupt somite segmentation by altering the CDH2-dependent epithelialization of PSM cells. Our data suggest that clathrin-mediated endocytosis is increased in PAPC expressing cells, subsequently affecting CDH2 internalization in the anterior compartment of the future somite. This in turn generates a differential adhesion interface, allowing formation of the acellular fissure that defines the somite boundary. Thus periodic expression of PAPC downstream of the Segmentation Clock triggers rhythmic endocytosis of CDH2, allowing for segmental de-adhesion and individualization of somites.', u'/content/early/2016/08/23/071084', [u'Developmental Biology'], [u"Brigham and Women's Hospital;", u'Harvard Medical School']]

A common approach to study such questions begins with extracting a network of statistically significant pairwise co-occurrences from a matrix of observed operational taxonomic unit (OTU) abundances across sites. The structure of this network is assumed to encode information about ecological interactions and processes, resistance to perturbation, and the identity of keystone species.  However, common methods for identifying these pairwise interactions can contaminate the network with spurious patterns that obscure true ecological signals. Here, we describe this problem in detail and develop a solution that incorporates null models to distinguish ecological signals from statistical noise. We apply these methods to the initial OTU abundance matrix and to the extracted network. We demonstrate this approach by applying it to a large soil microbiome data set and show that many previously reported patterns for these data are statistical artifacts. In contrast, we find the frequency of three-way interactions among microbial OTUs to be highly statistically significant.

Consider, for instance, that technologies in the Hadoop ecosystem have been successfully used in data-driven industry to scale their processes to levels much larger than any biological- or health-driven work attempted thus far. In this work we demonstrate the scalability of a sequence alignment pipeline based on technologies from the Hadoop ecosystem -- namely, Apache Flink and Hadoop MapReduce, both running on the distributed Apache YARN platform. Unlike previous work, our pipeline starts processing directly from the raw BCL data produced by Illumina sequencers. A Flink-based distributed algorithm reconstructs reads from the Illumina BCL data, and then demultiplexes them -- analogously to the bcl2fastq2 program provided by Illumina. Subsequently, the BWA-MEM-based distributed aligner from the Seal project is used to perform read mapping on the YARN platform. While the standard programs by Illumina and BWA-MEM are limited to shared-memory parallelism (multi-threading), our solution is completely distributed and can scale across a large number of computing nodes. Results show excellent pipeline scalability, linear in the number of nodes. In addition, this approach automatically benefits from the robustness to hardware failure and transient cluster problems provided by the YARN pipeline, as well as the scalability of the Hadoop Distributed File System. Moreover, this YARN-based approach complements the up-and-coming version 4 of the GATK toolkit, which is based on Spark and therefore can run on YARN.

Associated loci showed higher replication rates when compared to loci identified by GWAS or by considering all DHSs, allowing the additional discovery of 327 loci (FDR<0.005) below typical GWAS significance threshold, 52 of which are novel and replicating discoveries. Finally, we integrated DHS associations from six autoimmune diseases, using a network model (bird's-eye view) and a regulatory Manhattan plot schema (per locus). Taken together, we described and validated a strategy to leverage finely resolved regulatory priors, enhancing the discovery, interpretability, and resolution of genetic associations, and providing actionable insights for follow up work.", u'/content/early/2016/08/23/070268', [u'Genetics'], [u'Cornell University;', u'Genentech, Inc.;', u"King's College London"]]
[u'Genetically targeted 3D visualisation of Drosophila neurons under Electron Microscopy and X-Ray Microscopy using miniSOG', ['Julian Ng', 'Alyssa Browning', 'Lorenz Lechner', 'Masako Terada', 'Gillian Howard', 'Gregory Jefferis'], u'August 22, 2016.', u'Large dimension, high-resolution imaging is important for neural circuit visualisation as neurons have both long- and short-range patterns: from axons and dendrites to the numerous synapses at their endings. Electron Microscopy (EM) is the favoured approach for synaptic resolution imaging but how such structures can be segmented from high-density images within large volume datasets remains challenging. \nFluorescent probes are widely used to localise synapses, identify cell-types and in tracing studies. The equivalent EM approach would benefit visualising such labelled structures from within sub-cellular, cellular, tissue and neuroanatomical contexts.\nHere we developed genetically-encoded, electron-dense markers using miniSOG. We demonstrate their ability in 1) labelling cellular sub-compartments of genetically-targeted neurons, 2) generating contrast under different EM modalities, and 3) segmenting labelled structures from EM volumes using computer-assisted strategies. We also tested non-destructive X-ray imaging on whole Drosophila brains to evaluate contrast staining. This enables us to target specific regions for EM volume acquisition.', u'/content/early/2016/08/22/070755', [u'Neuroscience'], [u'University of Cambridge;', u'Zeiss X-Ray Microscopy;', u'MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology']]
[u'Subcortical volume and white matter integrity abnormalities in major depressive disorder: findings from UK Biobank (N=4446)', ['Xueyi Shen', 'Lianne Reus', 'Mark Adams', 'Simon Cox', 'Ian Deary', 'David Liewald', 'Mark Bastin', 'Daniel Smith', 'Heather Whalley', 'Andrew McIntosh'], u'August 22, 2016.', u'Background: Previous reports of altered grey and white matter structure in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) have been inconsistent. Recent meta-analyses have, however, reported reduced hippocampal grey matter volume in MDD and reduced white matter integrity in several brain regions. The use of different diagnostic criteria, different scanners and imaging sequences may, however, obscure further anatomical differences. \nMethods: In this study, we tested for differences in subcortical grey matter volume and white matter integrity between depressed individuals and controls in a large sample of subjects from the first data release of the UK Biobank imaging study of 4446 individuals, which used consistent diagnostic criteria at a single assessment centre, with a single MRI scanner and protocol. \nResults: Whilst we found no significant differences in subcortical volumes, we report significant reductions in depressed individuals versus controls in global white matter integrity, as measured by fractional anisotropy (FA) (\u03b2 = -0.187, p = 0.017). We also report reductions in FA in association/commissural fibres (\u03b2 = -0.184, p = 0.019) and thalamic radiations (\u03b2 = -0.175, p = 0.027). Examining tracts individually, we report tract-specific FA reductions in the left superior longitudinal fasciculus (\u03b2 = -0.218, pcorrected = 0.012) and superior thalamic radiation (\u03b2 = -0.258, pcorrected = 0.010) in subjects with depression. \nConclusions: Our findings highlight the need for further large adequately-powered studies of depression and provide further evidence for disrupted white matter integrity in the disorder. Future studies would focus on exploring the typical neuro-phenotype in homogenous subgroups of depression.', u'/content/early/2016/08/22/070912', [u'Neuroscience'], [u'Division of Psychiatry, School of Clinical Sciences, The University of Edinburgh;', u'Centre for Cognitive Ageing and Cognitive Epidemiology, The University of Edinburgh;', u'Department of Psychology, The University of Edinburgh;', u'Institute of Health and Wellbeing, Mental Health and Wellbeing Research Group, University of Glasgow;', u'Division of Psychiatry, The University of Edinburgh']]
[u'Protein Collapse is Encoded in the Folded State Architecture', ['Himadri S Samanta', 'Pavel Zhuravlev', 'Michael Hinczewski', 'Naoto Hori', 'Shaon Chakrabarti', 'Dave Thirumalai'], u'August 22, 2016.', u'The propensity of single domain globular proteins, the workhorses in cells, to be compact is the key reason that their folded states achieve high packing density. It is known that the radius of gyration, Rg, of both the folded and unfolded (created by adding denaturants) states increase as N\u03bd where N is the number of amino acids in the protein. The values of  the celebrated Flory exponent \u03bd are, respectively, \u2248 \u2153 and \u2248 0.6 in the folded and unfolded states, which coincide with those found in homopolymers in poor and good solvents.  However, the extent of compaction of the unfolded state of a protein under low denaturant concentration, conditions favoring the formation of the folded state, is unknown. This problem which goes to the heart of how proteins fold and has implications for the evolution of foldable sequences is unsolved. We develop a theory based on polymer physics concepts that uses the contact map of proteins as input to quantitatively assess collapsibility of proteins. The model, which includes only two-body excluded volume interaction and interactions reflecting the strength of the contact map, has only expanded and compact states. Surprisingly, we find that although protein collapsibility is universal, the propensity to be compact depends on the protein architecture. Application of the theory to over two thousand proteins shows that the extent of collapsibility depends not only on N but also on the contact map reflecting the native fold structure.  A major prediction of the theory is that \u03b2-sheet proteins are far more collapsible than structures dominated by \u03b1-helices.  The theory fully resolves the apparent controversy between conclusions reached using different experimental probes assessing the extent of compaction of a couple proteins. In addition, it reveals that there are considerable similarities between the physical mechanisms of homopolymer and protein collapse. The theory provides quantitative insights into the reasons why single domain proteins are small and the physical reasons for the origin of multi-domain proteins. We also show that non-coding RNA molecules, whose collapsibility is similar to proteins with \u03b2-sheet structures, must undergo collapse prior to folding, adding support to \u201cCompaction Selection Hypothesis\u201d proposed in the context of RNA compaction.', u'/content/early/2016/08/22/070920', [u'Biophysics'], [u'University of Texas at Austin;', u'University of Maryland;', u'Case Western Reserve University']]
[u'Rhythmic entrainment source separation: Optimizing analyses of neural responses to rhythmic sensory stimulation', ['Michael X Cohen', 'Rasa Gulbinaite'], u'August 22, 2016.', u'The so-called steady-state evoked potentials (SSEPs) are rhythmic brain responses to rhythmic sensory stimulation, and are often used to study perceptual and attentional processes. We present a data analysis method for maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio of the narrow-band steady-state response in the frequency and time-frequency domains. The method, termed rhythmic entrainment source separation (RESS), is based on denoising source separation approaches that take advantage of the simultaneous but differential projection of neural activity to many non-invasively placed electrodes or sensors. Our approach is a combination and extension of existing multivariate source separation methods. We demonstrate that RESS performs well on both simulated and empirical data, and outperforms conventional SSEP analysis methods based on selecting electrodes with the strongest SSEP response. We also discuss the potential confound of overfitting, whereby the filter captures noise in absence of a signal. Matlab scripts are available to replicate and extend our simulations and methods. We conclude with some practical advice for optimizing SSEP data analyses and interpreting the results.', u'/content/early/2016/08/22/070862', [u'Neuroscience'], [u'Radboud University;', u'Centre de Recherche Cerveau & Cognition, Toulouse, France']]
[u'Empirical validation of directed functional connectivity', ['Ravi D Mill', 'Anto Bagic', 'Walter Schneider', 'Michael W Cole'], u'August 22, 2016.', u"Mapping directions of influence in the human brain connectome represents the next phase in understanding its functional architecture. However, a host of methodological uncertainties have impeded the application of directed connectivity methods, which have primarily been validated via 'ground truth' connectivity patterns embedded in simulated functional MRI (fMRI) and magneto-/electro-encephalography (MEG/EEG) datasets. Such simulations rely on many generative assumptions, and we hence utilized a different strategy involving empirical data in which a ground truth directed connectivity pattern could be anticipated with confidence. Specifically, we exploited the established 'sensory reactivation' effect in episodic memory, in which retrieval of sensory information reactivates regions involved in perceiving that sensory modality. Subjects performed a paired associate task in separate fMRI and MEG sessions, in which a ground truth reversal in directed connectivity between auditory and visual sensory regions was instantiated across task conditions. This directed connectivity reversal was successfully recovered across different algorithms, including Granger causality and Bayes network (IMAGES) approaches, and across fMRI ('raw' and deconvolved) and source-modeled MEG. These results extend simulation studies of directed connectivity, and offer practical guidelines for the use of such methods in clarifying causal mechanisms of neural processing.", u'/content/early/2016/08/22/070979', [u'Neuroscience'], [u'Center for Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience, Rutgers University, USA;', u'Department of Neurology, University of Pittsburgh, USA;', u'Center for Neuroscience, University of Pittsburgh, USA']]
