[u'Accurate alignment between correlated light, cryo-light, and electron cryo-microscopy data using sample support features', ['Karen L Anderson', 'Christopher Page', 'Mark F Swift', 'Dorit Hanein', 'Niels Volkmann'], u'January 7, 2017.', u'Combining fluorescence microscopy with electron cryo-tomography allows, in principle, spatial localization of tagged macromolecular assemblies and structural features within the cellular environment. To allow precise localization and scale integration between the two disparate imaging modalities, accurate alignment procedures are needed. Here, we describe a marker-free method for aligning images from light or cryo-light fluorescence microscopy and from electron cryo-microscopy that takes advantage of sample support features, namely the holes in the carbon film. We find that the accuracy of this method, as judged by prediction errors of the hole center coordinates, is better than 100 nm.', u'/content/early/2017/01/07/099077', [], [u'Sanford Burnham Prebys']]
[u'fastBMA: Scalable Network Inference and Transitive Reduction', ['Ling-Hong Hung', 'Kaiyuan Shi', 'Migao Wu', 'William Chad Young', 'Adrian Raftery', 'Ka Yee Yeung'], u'January 6, 2017.', u'BACKGROUND:  Inferring genetic networks from genome-wide expression data is extremely demanding computationally. We have developed fastBMA, a distributed, parallel and scalable implementation of Bayesian model av-eraging (BMA) for this purpose. fastBMA also includes a novel and computationally efficient method for eliminating redundant indirect edges in the network.  FINDINGS: We evaluated the performance of fastBMA on synthetic data and experimental genome-wide yeast and human datasets. When using a single CPU core, fastBMA is up to 100 times faster than the next fastest method, LASSO, with increased accuracy. It is a memory efficient, parallel and distributed application that scales to human genome wide expression data. A 10,000-gene regulation network can be obtained in a matter of hours using a 32-core cloud cluster.  CONCLUSIONS: fastBMA is a significant improvement over its predecessor ScanBMA. It is orders of magnitude faster and more accurate than other fast network inference methods such as LASSO. The improved scalability allows it to calculate networks from genome scale data in a reasonable timeframe. The transitive reduction method can improve accuracy in denser networks. fastBMA is available as code (M.I.T. license) from GitHub (https://github.com/lhhunghimself/fastBMA), as part of the updated networkBMA Bio-conductor package (https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/networkBMA.html) and as ready-to-deploy Docker images (https://hub.docker.com/r/biodepot/fastbma/).', u'/content/early/2017/01/06/099036', [u'Systems Biology'], [u'University of Washington Tacoma;', u'University of Washington Seattle']]
