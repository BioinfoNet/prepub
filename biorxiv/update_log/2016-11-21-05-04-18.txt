[u'Immunotropic aspect of the Bacillus coagulans probiotic action', ['Tatiana Bomko', 'Tatiana Nosalskaya', 'Tatiana Kabluchko', 'Yuriy Lisnyak', 'Artur Viktorovich Martynov'], u'November 19, 2016.', u'Objective\nCurrently, probiotics are increasingly used as the alternative to antibiotics as well as the preventive measures in humans. In particular, probiotics occupy a key position in the treatment of antibiotics-associated intestinal dysbiosis. A spore-forming microorganism lactobacillus Bacillus coagulans is one of the most promising probiotics. However, some of its pharmacological effects remain poorly understood. \nAim. This study is aimed at investigation of the effect of Bacillus coagulans (Laktovit Forte) on the intestinal dysbiosis syndrome in mice caused by streptomycin against the background of cyclophosphamide-induced cellular immunodeficiency.    \nMethods. Pharmacological method: mouse model in vivo with immunodeficiency caused by cyclophosphamide.\n\nKey findings. In mice with colitis caused by streptomycin treatment, the administration of Bacillus coagulans (Laktovit Forte medicinal product) resulted in an antidiarrheal effect, normalization of gastrointestinal motility, and prevention of the animals weight loss. Given the cyclophosphamide-induced immunosuppression and streptomycin-associated diarrhoea, the immunity was completely restored only under the action of Bacillus coagulans. \n\nConclusions. According to all parameters, Bacillus coagulans has been proved to be more effective as compared to the Linex Forte reference product containing lacto- and bifidobacteria.', u'/content/early/2016/11/19/088757', [u'Pharmacology and Toxicology'], [u'Mechnikov Institute of Microbiology and Immunology']]
[u'PhysiCell: an Open Source Physics-Based Cell Simulator for 3-D Multicellular Systems', ['Ahmadreza Ghaffarizadeh', 'Samuel H. Friedman', 'Shannon M. Mumenthaler', 'Paul Macklin'], u'November 19, 2016.', u'Many multicellular systems problems can only be understood by studying how cells move, grow, divide, interact, and die. Tissue-scale dynamics emerge from systems of many interacting cells as they respond to and influence their microenvironment. The ideal "virtual laboratory" for such multicellular systems simulates both the biochemical microenvironment (the "stage") and many mechanically and biochemically interacting cells (the "players" upon the stage). \n\nPhysiCell--physics-based multicellular simulator--is an open source agent-based simulator that provides both the stage and the players for studying many interacting cells in dynamic tissue microenvironments. It builds upon a specialized multi-substrate biotransport solver so that modelers can link cell phenotype to multiple diffusing substrates and signaling factors. It includes biologically-driven sub-models for cell cycling, apoptosis, necrosis, solid and fluid volume changes, mechanics, and motility "out of the box," allowing modelers to concentrate on microenvironment-driven hypotheses. The C++ code has minimal dependencies, making it simple to maintain across platforms. PhysiCell has been parallelized with OpenMP, and its performance scales linearly with the number of cells. Simulations up to 10^5-10^6 cells are feasible on quad-core desktop workstations; larger simulations are attainable on single HPC compute nodes. \n\nWe demonstrate PhysiCell by simulating impact of necrotic core biomechanics, 3-D geometry, and stochasticity on the dynamics of hanging drop tumor spheroids and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast. PhysiCell is a powerful multicellular systems simulator that will be continually improved with new sub-models, capabilities, and performance improvements. It also represents a significant independent code base for replicating results from other simulation platforms.
