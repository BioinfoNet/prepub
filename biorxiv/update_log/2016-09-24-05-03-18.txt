In 2015, ninety-nine years after his death, a state funeral was offered to his living family to honor his role in the struggle for Irish independence. However, due to inaccuracies in record keeping, the bodily remains from Cork prison that supposedly belonged to Kent could not be identified with absolute certainty. At the request of the Irish National Police (An Garda S\xedoch\xe1na), we identified the remains presumed to be those of Kent using a novel method that compared homozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms obtained from next-generation shotgun sequencing with genetic data from two of Kent's known living relatives who share with him a third degree relationship. DNA degradation resulted in low sequence depth of Thomas Kent's DNA and only a few loci appeared as heterozygous, rendering traditional methods of relatedness estimation unusable. To remove potential bias, all loci were therefore analysed as homozygous, leading to a process we refer to as ''forced homozygote approach''. This procedure reduces the expected degree of relatedness to half of what is expected when heterozygotes are included; thus, Kent had a relationship coefficient (Queller and Goodnight's Rxy) of 12.5% with his third-degree relatives instead of the expected 25%. The results were confirmed using simulated data for different relatedness classes (2000 simulated individuals per class), also confirming Thomas Kent's identity. We argue that this method provides a necessary alternative for relatedness estimations, not only in forensic analysis, but also in ancient DNA studies, where reduced amounts of genetic information can limit the application of traditional methods.", u'/content/early/2016/09/23/076992', [u'Bioinformatics'], [u'University College Dublin;', u'Emory University;', u'Institute for Anthropological Research Zagreb;', u'National Forensic Coordination Office Ireland;', u'Forensic Science Ireland']]

Using synthetic pathogen-like particles (PLPs) that mimic physical properties of bacteria or large-viruses, we have discovered that the quality and quantity of Toll-like-receptor-9 (TLR9)-signaling by CpG in mouse dendritic cells (mDC) is uniquely dependent on biophysical attributes, specifically the surface-density of CpG and size of the presenting PLP. These physical patterns control DC-programming by regulating kinetics and magnitude of MyD88-IRAK4 signaling, NF\u03baB-driven responses, and STAT3 phosphorylation, which in turn controls differential T cell responses and in vivo immune-polarization, especially T-helper 1 (Th1) versus T-helper 2 (Th2) antibody responses.

[u'Host-induced gene silencing compromises Verticillium wilt in tomato and Arabidopsis', ['Yin Song', 'Bart Thomma'], u'September 23, 2016.', u'Verticillium wilt, caused by soil-borne fungi of the genus Verticillium, is an economically important disease that affects a wide range of host plants. Unfortunately, host resistance against Verticillium wilts is not available for many plant species, and the disease is notoriously difficult to combat. Host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) is an RNA interference (RNAi) based process in which small RNAs are produced by the host plant to target parasite transcripts. HIGS has emerged as a promising strategy for improving plant resistance against pathogens by silencing genes that are essential for these pathogens. Here, we assessed whether HIGS can be utilized to suppress Verticillium wilt disease by silencing previously identified virulence genes of V. dahliae through the host plants tomato and Arabidopsis. In transient assays, tomato plants were agroinfiltrated with Tobacco rattle virus (TRV) constructs to target V. dahliae transcripts. Subsequent V. dahliae inoculation revealed suppression of Verticillium wilt disease in some, but not all, cases. Next, expression of RNAi constructs targeting V. dahliae transcripts was pursued in stable transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants. Also in this host, V. dahliae inoculation revealed reduced Verticillium wilt disease in some cases. Thus, our study suggests that, depending on the target gene chosen, HIGS against V. dahliae is operational in tomato and A. thaliana plants and may act as a plant protection approach that may be used in Verticillium wilt-susceptible crops.', u'/content/early/2016/09/23/076976', [u'Plant Biology'], [u'Wageningen University']]

Whole genome sequence data of 2 belted and 130 control cattle yielded only one private genetic variant in the critical interval in the two belted animals. The belt-associated variant was a copy number variant (CNV) involving the quadruplication of a 6 kb non-coding sequence located approximately 16 kb upstream of the TWIST2 gene. Increased copy numbers at this CNV were strongly associated with the belt phenotype in a cohort of 239 cases and 1303 controls (p = 1.3 x 10E-278). We hypothesized that the CNV causes aberrant expression of TWIST2 during neural crest development, which might negatively affect melanoblasts. Functional studies showed that ectopic expression of bovine TWIST2 in neural crest in transgenic zebrafish led to a decrease in melanocyte numbers. Our results thus implicate an unsuspected involvement of TWIST2 in regulating pigmentation and reveal a non-coding CNV underlying a captivating Mendelian character.', u'/content/early/2016/09/23/077065', [u'Genetics'], [u'University of Bern;', u'Chronix Biomedical;', u'University of G\xf6ttingen;', u'Bern University of Applied Sciences;', u'University of Zurich;', u'Dutch Belted Cattle Association;', u'Agroscope;', u'University of Bath']]

Its applications are however currently limited by a number of methodological issues, among which the difficulty in obtaining accurate source localizations. In particular, these issues have so far prevented EEG studies from showing brain networks similar to those previously detected by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Here, we report for the first time a robust detection of brain networks from resting state (256-channel) hdEEG recordings, with a spatial accuracy comparable to fMRI networks. This result was achieved by setting up a tailored analysis pipeline including state-of-the-art tools for data preprocessing, realistic head model generation, source localization and functional connectivity analysis. Specifically, we obtained the highest similarity between hdEEG and fMRI networks by means of realistic 12-layer head models and eLORETA source localization, together with spatial ICA for functional connectivity analysis. Spatial ICA overcomes the spatial leakage problem by identifying patterns of coherent power fluctuations that are spatially independent over time. Our analyses showed that the number of electrodes in particular, but also the accuracy of the head model and the source localization method used have impact on network reconstruction.

[u"Neuroprotective strategies for NMDAR-mediated excitotoxicity in Huntington's Disease", ['Kimberly Dayle Girling', 'Yu Tian Wang'], u'September 23, 2016.', u'BACKGROUND: Huntington\'s Disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease causing severe neurodegeneration of the striatum as well as marked cognitive and motor disabilities. Excitotoxicity, caused by overstimulation of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) has been shown to have a key role in the neuropathogenesis of HD, suggesting that targeting NMDAR-dependent signaling may be an effective clinical approach for HD. However, broad NMDAR antagonists are generally poor therapeutics in clinical practice. It has been suggested that GluN2A-containing, synaptically located NMDARs activate cell survival signaling pathways, while GluN2B-containing, primarily extrasynaptic NMDARs trigger cell death signaling. A better approach to development of effective therapeutics for HD may be to target, specifically, the cell-death specific pathways associated with extrasynaptic GluN2B NMDAR activation, while maintaining or potentiating the cell-survival activity of GluN2A-NMDARs.\n\nOBJECTIVE: This review outlines the role of NMDAR-mediated excitotoxicity in HD and overviews current efforts to develop better therapeutics for HD where NMDAR excitotoxicity is the target.\n\nMETHODS: A systematic review process was conducted using the PubMed search engine focusing on research conducted in the past 5-10 years. 250 articles were consulted for the review, with key search terms including "Huntington\'s Disease", "excitotoxicity", "NMDAR" and "therapeutics".\n\nRESULTS: A wide range of NMDAR excitotoxicity-based targets for HD were identified and reviewed, including targeting NMDARs directly by blocking GluN2B, extrasynaptic NMDARs and/or potentiating GluN2A, synaptic NMDARs, targeting glutamate release or uptake, or targeting specific downstream cell-death signaling of NMDARs.\nNMDA Excitotoxicity Huntington\'s Disease\n\nCONCLUSION: The current review identifies NMDAR-mediated excitotoxicity as a key player in HD pathogenesis and points to various excitotoxicity-focused targets as potential future preventative therapeutics for HD.\n\nKey words: Huntington\'s Disease, NMDA receptor, excitotoxicity, cell death, therapeutics', u'/content/early/2016/09/23/076885', [u'Neuroscience'], [u'University of British Columbia']]
[u'Comparative analysis of 2D and 3D distance measurements to study spatial genome organization', ['Elizabeth Finn', 'Gianluca Pegoraro', 'Sigal Shachar', 'Tom Misteli'], u'September 23, 2016.', u'The spatial organization of eukaryotic genomes is non-random, cell-type specific, and has been linked to cellular function.  The investigation of spatial organization has traditionally relied extensively on fluorescence microscopy. The validity of the imaging methods used to probe spatial genome organization often depends on the accuracy and precision of distance measurements. Imaging-based measurements may either use 2 dimensional datasets or 3D datasets including the z-axis information in image stacks. Here we compare the suitability of 2D versus 3D distance measurements in the analysis of various features of spatial genome organization. We find in general good agreement between 2D and 3D analysis with higher convergence of measurements as the interrogated distance increases, especially in flat cells. Overall, 3D distance measurements are more accurate than 2D distances, but are also more prone to noise.  In particular, z-stacks are prone to error due to imaging properties such as limited resolution along the z-axis and optical aberrations, and we also find significant deviations from unimodal distance distributions caused by low sampling frequency in z. These deviations can be ameliorated by sampling at much higher frequency in the z-direction. We conclude that 2D distances are preferred for comparative analyses between cells, but 3D distances are preferred when comparing to theoretical models in large samples of cells. In general, 2D distance measurements remain preferable for many applications of analysis of spatial genome organization.', u'/content/early/2016/09/23/076893', [u'Cell Biology'], [u'National Cancer Institute, NIH']]
