[u'An algorithm for fast preranked gene set enrichment analysis using cumulative statistic calculation', ['Alexey Sergushichev'], u'June 20, 2016.', u'Gene set enrichment analysis is a widely used tool for analyzing gene \nexpression data. However, current implementations are slow due to a large\nnumber of required samples for the analysis to have a good statistical power.\nIn this paper we present a novel algorithm, that efficiently reuses\none sample multiple times and thus speeds up the analysis.\nWe show that it is possible to make hundreds of thousands permutations \nin a few minutes, which leads to very accurate p-values. This, in turn,\nallows applying standard FDR correction procedures, which are\nmore accurate than the ones currently used.\nThe method is implemented in a form of an R package and \nis freely available at \\url{https://github.com/ctlab/fgsea}.', u'/content/early/2016/06/20/060012', [], [u'ITMO University']]
[u'A temperature-dependent shift in dietary preference alters the viable temperature range of Drosophila', ['Marko Brankatschk', 'Theresia Gutmann', 'Michal Grzybek', 'Beate Brankatschk', 'Uenal Coskun', 'Suzanne Eaton'], u'June 20, 2016.', u'How cold-blooded animals adapt their behaviour and physiology to survive seasonal changes in temperature is not completely understood - even for well-studied model organisms like Drosophila melanogaster. Here, we show that Drosophila can extend their viable temperature range through temperature-dependent changes in feeding behaviour.  Above 15\u02daC, Drosophila feed and lay eggs on yeast.  In contrast, below 15\u02daC, Drosophila prefer to feed and lay eggs on plant material.  The different lipids present in yeast and plants improve survival at high and low temperatures, respectively. Yeast lipids promote high tempera-ture survival by increasing systemic insulin signalling.  This expands the range over which developmental rate increases with temperature, suggesting that faster nutrient utilization is required to fuel biochemical reactions driven faster by ki-netic energy. In addition to speeding development, yeast lipids increase fertility. Thus, yeast provide cues that could help Drosophila to exploit a transient summer food resource. Plant lipids, on the other hand, are required to maintain mem-brane lipid fluidity at low temperature, and increase cold-resistance of larvae and adults. The cold-resistance and lowered insulin signalling conferred by feeding on plants allows adults to survive for many months at temperatures consistent with overwintering in temperate climates. Thus, temperature-dependent changes in feeding behaviour produce physiological changes that could promote seasonal adaption.', u'/content/early/2016/06/20/059923', [], [u'Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics;', u'German Center for Diabetes Research;', u'Paul Langerhans Institute Dresden of the Helmholtz Centre Munich at the University Clinic Carl Gusta']]
[u'Emergence of microbial diversity due to cross-feeding interactions in a spatial model of gut microbial metabolism', ['Milan J.A. van Hoek', 'Roeland M.H. Merks'], u'June 20, 2016.', u"Background:\nThe human gut contains approximately 10e+14 bacteria, belonging to hundreds of different species. Together, these microbial species form a complex food web that can break down food sources that our own digestive enzymes cannot handle, including complex polysaccharides, producing short chain fatty acids and additional metabolites, e.g., vitamin K. The diversity of microbial diversity is important for colonic health: Changes in the composition of the microbiota have been associated with inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, obestity and Crohn's disease, and make the microbiota more vulnerable to infestation by harmful species, e.g., Clostridium difficile. To get a grip on the controlling factors of microbial diversity in the gut, we here propose a multi-scale, spatiotemporal dynamic flux-balance analysis model to study the emergence of metabolic diversity in a spatial gut-like, tubular environment. The model features genome-scale metabolic models of microbial populations, resource sharing via extracellular metabolites, and spatial population dynamics and evolution.\nResults:\nIn this model, cross-feeding interactions emerge readily, despite the species' ability to metabolize sugars autonomously. Interestingly, the community requires cross-feeding for producing a realistic set of short-chain fatty acids from an input of glucose, If we let the composition of the microbial subpopulations change during invasion of adjacent space, a complex and stratifed microbiota evolves, with subspecies specializing on cross-feeding interactions via a mechanism of compensated trait loss. The microbial diversity and stratification collapse if the flux through the gut is enhanced to mimic diarrhea. \nConclusions:\nIn conclusion, this in silico model is a helpful tool in systems biology to predict and explain the controlling factors of microbial diversity in the gut. It can be extended to include, e.g., complex food source, and host-microbiota interactions via the gut wall.", u'/content/early/2016/06/20/059956', [], [u'Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica']]
[u'Genomic dissection of an Icelandic epidemic of equine respiratory disease', ['Sigriur Bjornsdottir', 'Simon R Harris', 'Vilhjalmur Svansson', 'Eggert Gunnarsson', 'Olof Sigurardottir', 'Kristina Gammeljord', 'Karen F Steward', 'J Richard Newton', 'Carl Robinson', 'Amelia R. L. Charbonneau', 'Julian Parkhill', 'Matthew T. G. Holden', 'Andrew S. Waller'], u'June 20, 2016.', u'The native horse population of Iceland has remained free of major infectious diseases. Between May and July 2010 an epidemic of respiratory disease swept through the population. Initial microbiological investigations ruled out known equine viral agents as the cause of the infections, but identified the opportunistic pathogen Streptococcus zooepidemicus as being frequently isolated from diseased animals. This diverse bacterial species has a broad host range and is usually regarded as a commensal of horses. By genome sequencing S. zooepidemicus recovered from horses during the epidemic we show that although multiple clones of S. zooepidemicus were present in the population, one particular clone, ST209, was responsible for the epidemic. Concurrent with the epidemic, ST209 caused zoonotic infections, highlighting the pathogenic potential of this clone. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the original ST209 strain entered Iceland in late 2008 or early 2009. Epidemiological investigation revealed that the incursion of this strain into a training yard that utilized a submerged treadmill between the 5th and 19th of February 2010 was a critical trigger for the ensuing epidemic of disease, provided a nidus for the infection of multiple horses, and subsequent distribution of these animals to multiple sites in Iceland.', u'/content/early/2016/06/20/059949', [u'Microbiology'], [u'MAST Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority;', u'Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute;', u'University of Iceland;', u'University of Copenhagen;', u'Animal Health Trust;', u'University of St Andrews']]

To define the smoke-induced immune responses in the lung we performed bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) on smokers and non-smokers, both MS-patients and healthy volunteers. In the BAL, non-smokers with MS showed an increased preformed CD40L expression in CD4+ T-cells while smokers displayed an increase in proliferating (Ki-67+) T-cells. In addition, our results confirm that smoking induces an increase of alveolar macrophages in BAL, and further defined a significant attenuation of this response in carriers of the HLA-DRB1*15 allele, in both MS patients and healthy controls. This first systematic investigation of the immune response in the lungs of smokers and non-smokers diagnosed with MS, thus suggests an MS-associated lung T-cell phenotype, involvement of a specific T-cell response to smoke, and a genetic regulation of the macrophage response', u'/content/early/2016/06/20/054502', [u'Immunology'], [u'Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden;', u'Karolinska Institutet']]
[u'The importance of litter quality for the role of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in plant litter decomposition', ['Eva Leifheit', 'Matthias C Rillig'], u'June 20, 2016.', u'Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) have been shown to positively and negatively affect plant litter decomposition. The use of litter types with different quality and different observation periods might be responsible for these contradictory results. Therefore, we performed a 10-week laboratory experiment with 7 litter types differing in their C:N ratio, and tested for effects of litter quality and the presence of AMF on litter decomposition. We found that decomposition of plant litter with higher C:N ratios was only beginning and was stimulated by AMF, whereas decomposition of plant litter with lower C:N ratios had already progressed and was decreased by AMF. With this study we show that not only litter quality is important for effects of AMF on litter decomposition, but also the stage of litter decomposition.', u'/content/early/2016/06/20/059907', [u'Ecology'], [u'Freie Universitaet Berlin, Institut fuer Biologie;', u'Freie Universitaet Berlin, Insitut fuer Biologie, Plant Ecology']]
