[u'The Time and Place of European Admixture in the Ashkenazi Jewish History', ['James Xue', 'Todd Lencz', 'Ariel Darvasi', "Itsik Pe'er", 'Shai Carmi'], u'July 10, 2016.', u'The Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) population is important in medical genetics due to its high rate of Mendelian disorders and other unique genetic characteristics. Ashkenazi Jews have appeared in Europe in the 10th century, and their ancestry is thought to involve an admixture of European (EU) and Middle-Eastern (ME) groups. However, both the time and place of admixture in Europe are obscure and subject to intense debate. Here, we attempt to characterize the Ashkenazi admixture history using a large Ashkenazi sample and careful application of new and existing methods. Our main approach is based on local ancestry inference, assigning each Ashkenazi genomic segment as EU or ME, and comparing allele frequencies across EU segments to those of different EU populations. The contribution of each EU source was also evaluated using GLOBETROTTER and analysis of IBD sharing. The time of admixture was inferred using multiple tools, relying on statistics such as the distributions of segment lengths and the total EU ancestry per chromosome and the correlation of ancestries along the chromosome. Our simulations demonstrated that distinguishing EU vs ME ancestry is subject to considerable noise at the single segment level, but nevertheless, conclusions could be drawn based on chromosome-wide statistics. The predominant source of EU ancestry in AJ was found to be Southern European (\u224860-80%), with the rest being likely Eastern European. The inferred admixture time was \u224835 generations ago, but multiple lines of evidence suggests that it represents an average over two or more admixture events, pre- and post-dating the founder event experienced by AJ in late medieval times. The time of the pre-bottleneck admixture event was bounded to 25-55 generations ago.', u'/content/early/2016/07/10/063099', [], [u'Harvard University;', u'North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System;', u'The Hebrew University of Jerusalem;', u'Columbia University']]

[u'Competition between continuously evolving lineages in asexual populations', ['Noah Ribeck', 'Joseph S. Mulka', 'Luis Zaman', 'Brian D. Connelly', 'Richard E. Lenski'], u'July 10, 2016.', u'In an asexual population, the fate of a beneficial mutation depends on how its lineage competes against other mutant lineages in the population. With high beneficial mutation rates or large population sizes, competition between contending mutations is strong, and successful lineages can accumulate multiple mutations before any single one achieves fixation. Most current theory about asexual population dynamics either neglects this multiple-mutations regime or introduces simplifying assumptions that may not apply. Here, we develop a theoretical framework that describes the dynamics of adaptation and substitution over all mutation-rate regimes by conceptualizing the population as a collection of continuously adapting lineages. This model of \u201clineage interference\u201d shows that each new mutant\u2019s advantage over the rest of the population must be above a critical threshold in order to likely achieve fixation, and we derive a simple expression for that threshold. We apply this framework to examine the role of beneficial mutations with different effect sizes across the transition to the multiple-mutations regime.', u'/content/early/2016/07/10/062976', [], [u'Michigan State University, United States;', u'University of Washington, United States']]

Molecular\ndynamics experiments with flavavirus RdRp suggest that the conformation of the conservative motif F in the\npolymerase is highly sensitive to the bond lengths between the zinc atoms and their four coordinating atoms. In the experimental structures of flavavirus RdRp, motif F is presented in two different conformations. The polymerase acts as a catalyst only in one of the motif F conformations. We hypothesize that the second conformation is required for the formation of the viral replicative complex and that it is the quantum transition in the zinc atoms which slightly changes the bond lengths; thus assisting the switch between the two motif F conformations.', u'/content/early/2016/07/10/063024', [], [u'LIN SB RAS']]

The characteristic symptoms of schizophrenia such as delusions, hallucinations, passivity experiences etc. are suggested to reflect a disordered self-awareness. In the present study, we used a novel fMRI paradigm, the "Hallucination Attentional Modulation Task (HAMT)", to examine the functional connectivity patterns underlying the experience of auditory verbal hallucinations in contrast to the patterns associated with processing of visual stimuli. We found that there was substantial overlap amongst healthy (n=8) and schizophrenia (n=6) subjects with respect to the functional connectivity patterns during the \'free attention\' and \'visual attention\' conditions of the paradigm. In patients with schizophrenia having continuous auditory verbal hallucinations, the connectivity between the bilateral superior parietal lobules and bilateral thalami were stronger during the \'hallucination attention\' condition.

Lasseigne', 'Andrew Hardigan', 'Laura Palacio', 'David Gunther', 'Marie Kirby', 'Richard M. Myers', 'Sara J. Cooper'], u'July 10, 2016.', u'Despite advances in cancer diagnosis and treatment strategies, robust prognostic signatures remain elusive in most cancers. Cell proliferation has long been recognized as a prognostic marker in cancer, but it has not been thoroughly investigated across multiple cancers. Here we explore the role of cell proliferation across 19 cancers (n=6,581 patients) using tissue-based RNA sequencing from The Cancer Genome Atlas project by employing a "proliferative index" derived from gene expression associated with PCNA expression. This proliferative index is significantly associated with patient survival (Cox, p-value<0.05) in 7/19 cancers, which we have defined as "proliferation-informative cancers" (PICs). In PICs the proliferative index is strongly correlated with tumor stage and nodal invasion. PICs paradoxically demonstrate reduced baseline expression of proliferation machinery relative to non-PICs suggesting that non-PICs saturate their proliferative capacity early in tumor development and allow other factors to dictate prognostic outcomes. We also identify chemotherapies whose efficacy is correlated with proliferation index and highlight drugs capable of inhibiting proliferation associated expression. Additionally, we find that proliferative index is significantly associated with gross somatic mutation burden (Spearman, p=1.76x10-23) as well mutations in individual driver genes. This analysis provides a comprehensive characterization of tumor proliferation rates and their association with disease progression and prognosis across cancer types and highlights specific cancers that may be particularly susceptible to improved targeting of this classic cancer hallmark.', u'/content/early/2016/07/10/063057', [], [u'HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology, University of Alabama at Birmingham;', u'HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology']]

[u'Whole genome analysis of the methylome and hydroxymethylome in normal and malignant lung and liver', ['Xin Li', 'Yun Liu', 'Tal Salz', 'Kasper D Hansen', 'Andrew P Feinberg'], u'July 10, 2016.', u'DNA methylation at the 5-postion of cytosine (5mC) is a well-established epigenetic modification which regulates gene expression and cellular plasticity in development and disease. The ten-eleven translocation (TET) gene family is able to oxidize 5mC to 5-hydroxymethyl-cytosine (5hmC), providing an active mechanism for DNA demethylation, and may also provide its own regulatory function. Here we applied oxidative bisulfite sequencing to generate whole-genome DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation maps at single-base resolution in paired human liver and lung normal and cancer. We found that 5hmC is significantly enriched in CpG island (CGI) shores while depleted in CGIs themselves, in particular at active genes, resulting in a 5hmC but not 5mC bimodal distribution around CGI corresponding to H3K4me1 marks. Hydroxymethylation on promoters, gene bodies, and transcription termination regions showed strong positive correlation with gene expression within and across tissues, suggesting that 5hmC is a mark of active genes and could play a role gene expression mediated by DNA demethylation. Comparative analysis of methylomes and hydroxymethylomes revealed that 5hmC is significantly enriched in both tissue specific DMRs (t-DMRs) and cancer specific DMRs (c-DMRs), and 5hmC is negatively correlated with methylation changes, particularly in non-CGI associated DMRs. Together these findings indicate that changes in 5mC as well as in 5hmC and coupled to H3K4me1 correspond to differential gene expression in tissues and matching tumors, revealing an intricate gene expression regulation through interplay of methylome, hydroxyl-methylome, and histone modifications.', u'/content/early/2016/07/10/062588', [], [u'Johns Hopkins University']]

Taylor', 'Salvador Almagro-Moreno'], u'July 10, 2016.', u'Some microbes can transition from an environmental lifestyle to a pathogenic one. This ecological switch typically occurs through the acquisition of horizontally acquired virulence genes. However, the genomic features that must be present in a population prior to the acquisition of virulence genes and emergence of pathogenic clones remain unknown. We hypothesized that virulence adaptive polymorphisms (VAPs) circulate in environmental populations and are required for this transition. We developed a comparative genomic framework for identifying VAPs, using Vibrio cholerae as a model. We then characterized several environmental VAP alleles to show that one of them reduced the ability of clinical strains to colonize a mammalian host, whereas two other alleles conferred efficient colonization. These results show that VAPs are present in environmental bacterial populations prior to the emergence of virulent clones. We propose a scenario in which VAPs circulate in the environment, they become selected and enriched under certain ecological conditions, and finally a genomic background containing several VAPs acquires virulence factors that allows for its emergence as a pathogenic clone.', u'/content/early/2016/07/10/063115', [], [u'University of Montreal;', u'Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth']]

As distribution coefficients capture both thermodynamic effects (the free energy of transfer between phases) and chemical effects (protonation state and tautomer effects in aqueous solution), they provide an exacting test of the thermodynamic and chemical accuracy of physical models without the long correlation times inherent to the prediction of more complex properties of relevance to drug discovery, such as protein-ligand binding affinities. For the SAMPL5 challenge, we carried out a blind prediction exercise in which participants were tasked with the prediction of distribution coefficients to assess its potential as a new route for the evaluation and systematic improvement of predictive physical models. These measurements are typically performed for octanol-water, but we opted to utilize cyclohexane for the nonpolar phase. Cyclohexane was suggested to avoid issues with the high water content and persistent heterogeneous structure of water- saturated octanol phases, since it has which has greatly reduced water content and a homogeneous liquid structure. Using a modified shake-flask LC-MS/MS protocol, we collected cyclohexane/water distribution coefficients for a set of 53 druglike compounds at pH 7.4. These measurements were used as the basis for the SAMPL5 Distribution Coefficient Challenge, where 18 research groups predicted these measurements before the experimental values reported here were released.

[u'Boosting alignment accuracy through adaptive local realignment', ['Dan DeBlasio', 'John Kececioglu'], u'July 10, 2016.', u'Motivation: While mutation rates can vary across the residues of a protein, when computing alignments of protein sequences the same setting of values for substitution score and gap penalty parameters is typically used across their entire length. We provide for the first time a new method called adaptive local realignment that automatically uses diverse parameter settings in different regions of the input sequences when computing multiple sequence alignments. This allows parameter settings to adapt to more closely match the local mutation rate across a protein.\n\nMethod: Our method builds on our prior work on global alignment parameter advising with the Facet alignment accuracy estimator. Given a computed alignment, in each region that has low estimated accuracy, a collection of candidate realignments is generated using a precomputed set of alternate parameter settings. If one of these alternate realignments has higher estimated accuracy than the original subalignment, the region is replaced with the new realignment, and the concatenation of these realigned regions forms the final alignment that is output.\n\nResults: Adaptive local realignment significantly improves the quality of alignments over using the single best default parameter setting. In particular, this new method of local advising, when combined with prior methods for global advising, boosts alignment accuracy by as much as 26% over the best default setting on hard-to-align benchmarks (and by 6.4% over using global advising alone).\n\nAvailability: A new version of the Opal multiple sequence aligner that incorporates adaptive local realignment using Facet for parameter advising, is available free for non-commercial use at http://facet.cs.arizona.edu.', u'/content/early/2016/07/10/063131', [], [u'University of Arizona']]
