[u'Experiment-friendly kinetic analysis of single molecule data in and out of equilibrium', ['Sonja Schmid', 'Markus Gotz', 'Thorsten Hugel'], u'May 23, 2016.', u"We present a simple and robust technique to extract kinetic rate models and thermodynamic quantities from single molecule time traces. SMACKS (Single Molecule Analysis of Complex Kinetic Sequences) is a maximum likelihood approach that works equally well for long trajectories as for a set of short ones. It resolves all statistically relevant rates and also their uncertainties. This is achieved by optimizing one global kinetic model based on the complete dataset, while allowing for experimental variations between individual trajectories. In particular, neither a priori models nor equilibrium have to be assumed. The power of SMACKS is demonstrated on the kinetics of the multi-domain protein Hsp90 measured by smFRET (single molecule F\xf6rster resonance energy transfer). Experiments in and out of equilibrium are analyzed and compared to simulations, shedding new light on the role of Hsp90's ATPase function. SMACKS pushes the boundaries of single molecule kinetics far beyond current methods.", u'/content/early/2016/05/23/054577', [u'Biophysics'], [u'University of Freiburg']]
[u'NCS1 regulates Ca2+-Dependent Focal Exocytosis of Golgi-derived Vesicles to Help Phagocytic uptake in Macrophages', ['Nimi Vashi', 'Syed Bilal Ahmad Andrabi', 'Swapnil S Ghanwat', 'Mrutyunjay Suar', 'Dhiraj Kumar'], u'May 23, 2016.', u'During phagocytic uptake by macrophages, role of Golgi apparatus or vesicles derived from it has never been established. Using fluorescently tagged Mannosidase-II, a marker for Golgi-derived vesicles, we show these vesicles are recruited during uptake of diverse targets including latex beads, E. coli, Salmonella Typhimurium and Mycobacterium tuberculosis in both human and mouse macrophages. The recruitment of Mannosidase-II vesicles occurred very early during phagocytosis, which was mediated by focal exocytosis. The focal movement of Mannosidase-II vesicles required Ca2+ from both extra- and intra-cellular sources apart from PI3Kinase, microtubules and dynamin-2. At the site of uptake voltage-gated Ca2+ channels help establish a Ca2+-dependent local PIP3 gradient, which guide the focal movement. Mannosidase-II vesicles also contained Neuronal Calcium Sensor-1 (NCS1) and resembled secretory vesicles. Depleting NCS1 blocked the recruitment of Mannosidase-II vesicles and inhibited phagocytic uptake of diverse targets. We propose Golgi-derived vesicles provide membrane for phagosome biogenesis and are universally required for phagocytosis, the key innate defense function.', u'/content/early/2016/05/23/054858', [u'Cell Biology'], [u'ICGEB;', u'School of Biotechnology, KIIT University;', u'International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology']]
[u'Beta regression improves the detection of differential DNA methylation for epigenetic epidemiology', ['Timothy J Triche', 'Peter W. Laird', 'Kimberly D. Siegmund'], u'May 23, 2016.', u'DNA methylation is the most readily assayed epigenetic mark, possessing confirmed relationships with gene expression, imprinting, and chromatin accessibility.  Given the increasingly widespread use of DNA methylation microarrays in population-scale epidemiological applications, we sought to determine which methods provided the greatest statistical power to reproducibly detect differences in DNA methylation across various conditions, using publicly available data sets on tissue type and aging.\n\nBeta regression, as proposed originally by Ferrari and Cribari-Neto, yielded more validated hits in each of our comparisons than any other method under consideration, both in a regression setting and in comparisons to two-group tests such as the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney, Student t, and Welch t tests.  In large cohorts of whole blood samples, we corrected for compositional differences and batch effects, and found that marginal likelihood ratio tests from beta regression models uniformly dominate popular alternatives based on linear models.  The superior sensitivity and specificity exhibited by beta regression in epidemiologically relevant cohort sizes corresponded to approximately a 2% increase in sensitivity at the same specificity when compared to linear models fitted on raw beta values (proportion of signal intensity due to the methylated allele), M-values, or rank quantile normalized values.\n\nInvestigators should consider beta regression to maximize statistical power in studies of DNA methylation using microarrays.  At epidemiologically relevant sample sizes, with typical quality control procedures (compositional and batch effect correction), cross-cohort agreement uniformly favors beta regression over popular alternatives.', u'/content/early/2016/05/23/054643', [u'Bioinformatics'], [u'USC;', u'Van Andel Research Institute']]
