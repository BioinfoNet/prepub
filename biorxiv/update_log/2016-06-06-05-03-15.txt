[u'On the optimal response vigor and choice under variable motivational drives', ['Amir Dezfouli'], u'June 5, 2016.', u'Within a rational framework, a decision-maker selects actions based on the reward-maximisation principle, i.e., acquiring the highest amount of reward with the lowest cost. Action selection can be divided into two dimensions: (i) selecting an action among several alternatives, and (ii) choosing the response vigor, i.e., how fast the selected action should be executed. Previous works have addressed the computational substrates of such a selection process under the assumption that outcome values are stationary and do not change during the course of a session. This assumption does not hold when the motivational drive of the decision-maker is variable, because it leads to changes in the values of the outcomes, e.g., satiety decreases the value of the outcome. Here, we utilize an optimal control framework and derive the optimal choice and response vigor under different experimental conditions. The results imply that, in contrast to previous suggestions, even under conditions that the values of the outcomes are changing during the session, the optimal response rate in an instrumental conditioning experiment is a constant response rate rather than decreasing. Furthermore, we prove that the uncertainty of the decision-maker about the duration of the session explains the commonly observed decrease in response rates within a session. We also show that when the environment consists of multiple outcomes, the model explains probability matching as well as maximisation choice strategies. These results, therefore, provide a quantitative analysis of optimal choice and response vigor under variable motivational drive, and provide predictions for future testing.', u'/content/early/2016/06/05/057208', [], [u'CSIRO']]
[u'Deleterious variants in Asian rice and the potential cost of domestication', ['Qingpo Liu', 'Yongfeng Zhou', 'Peter L. Morrell', 'Brandon S. Gaut'], u'June 5, 2016.', u'SNPs that are predicted to encode deleterious amino acid variants provide unique insights into population history, the dynamics of selection, and the genetic bases of phenotypes. This may be especially true for domesticated species, where a history of bottlenecks and selection can contribute to the accumulation of deleterious SNPs (dSNPs). Here we investigate the numbers and frequencies of deleterious variants in Asian rice (O. sativa), focusing on two separate varieties (japonica and indica) that may have been domesticated independently. Comparative analyses in two population datasets each for japonica and indica rice -- using SNPs identified in separate variant calling pipelines and applying two distinct tools for the prediction of deleterious variants -- were consistent in indicating that the transition to domesticated rice has shifted site frequency spectra for all derived variants but particularly for dSNPs. This potential \u201ccost of domestication\u201d is higher in genomic regions of low recombination and within regions of putative selective sweeps. A characteristic feature of rice domestication was a shift in mating system from outcrossing to predominantly selfing. Using forward simulations, we show that this shift in mating system likely ameliorates the cost of domestication through purging of deleterious variants.', u'/content/early/2016/06/05/057224', [], [u'Zhejiang A&F University;', u'UC Irvine;', u'University of Minnesota']]
[u"Extending Levelt's Propositions to perceptual multistability involving interocular grouping", ['Alain Jacot-Guillarmod', 'Yunjiao Wang', 'Claudia Pedroza', 'Haluk Ogmen', 'Zachary Kilpatrick', 'Kresimir Josic'], u'June 5, 2016.', u"Levelt's Propositions have been a touchstone for experimental and modeling studies of perceptual multistability. We asked whether Levelt's Propositions extend to perceptual multistability involving interocular grouping. To address this question we used split-grating stimuli with complementary halves of the same color. As in previous studies, subjects reported four percepts in alternation: the two stimuli presented to each eye (single-eye percepts), as well as two interocularly grouped, single color percepts (grouped percepts). Most subjects responded to increased color saturation by more frequently reporting  a single color image, thus increasing the predominance of grouped percepts (Levelt's Proposition I). In these subjects increased predominance was due to a decrease in the average dominance duration of single-eye percepts, while that of grouped percepts remained largely unaffected. This is in accordance with generalized Levelt's Proposition II which posits that the average dominance duration of the stronger (in this case single-eye) percept is primarily affected by changes in stimulus strength. \nIn accordance with Proposition III, the alternation rate increased as the difference in the strength of the percepts decreased. \nTo explain the mechanism behind these observations, we introduce a hierarchical model consisting of low-level neural populations, each responding to input at a visual hemifield, and  higher-level populations representing the percepts. \nThe model exhibits the changes in dominance duration observed in the data, and conforms to all of Levelt's Propositions.", u'/content/early/2016/06/05/057232', [], [u'Lausanne University;', u'Texas Southern University;', u'University of Texas;', u'University of Houston;', u'University of Colorado, Boulder']]

This is particularly true in genetic association studies where a substantial proportion of the variation of human phenotypes is driven by numerous genetic variants of small effect. The current strategy to improve power to identify these weak associations consists of applying standard marginal statistical approaches and increasing study sample sizes. While successful, this approach does not leverage the environmental and genetic factors shared between the multiple phenotypes collected in contemporary cohorts. Here we develop a method that improves the power of detecting associations when a large number of correlated variables have been measured on the same samples. Our analyses over real and simulated data provide direct support that large sets of correlated variables can be leveraged to achieve dramatic increases in statistical power equivalent to a two or even three folds increase in sample size.', u'/content/early/2016/06/05/057190', [], [u'Department of Epidemiology, Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA;', u'Bioinformatics Research Centre, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark;', u'Department of Biomedical Informatics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA;', u"Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA;", u'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Institute of Human Genetics, San Francisco, CA, USA;', u'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA;', u'Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA']]
[u'KIF1A/UNC-104 transports ATG-9 to regulate neurodevelopment and autophagy at synapses', ['Andrea K.H. Stavoe', 'Sarah E. Hill', 'Daniel A. Colon-Ramos'], u'June 5, 2016.', u'Autophagy is a cellular degradation process essential for neuronal development and survival. Neurons are highly polarized cells in which autophagosome biogenesis is spatially compartmentalized. The mechanisms and physiological importance of this spatial compartmentalization of autophagy in the neuronal development of living animals are not well understood. Here we determine that, in C. elegans neurons, autophagosomes form near synapses and are required for neurodevelopment. We first determined, through unbiased genetic screens and systematic genetic analyses, that autophagy is required cell-autonomously for presynaptic assembly and for axon outgrowth dynamics in specific neurons. We observe autophagosomes in the axon near synapses, and this localization depends on the synaptic vesicle kinesin, KIF1A/UNC-104. KIF1A/UNC-104 coordinates localized autophagosome formation by regulating the transport of the integral membrane autophagy protein, ATG-9. Our findings indicate that autophagy is spatially regulated in neurons through the transport of ATG-9 by KIF1A/UNC-104 to regulate neurodevelopment.', u'/content/early/2016/06/05/057166', [u'Cell Biology'], [u'Yale University']]

[u'Fungal Induced Protein Hyperacetylation Identified by Acetylome Profiling', ['Justin W Walley', 'Zhouxin Shen', 'Maxwell R McReynolds', 'Steven P Briggs'], u'June 5, 2016.', u'Lysine acetylation is a key post-translational modification that regulates diverse proteins\ninvolved in a range of biological processes. The role of histone acetylation in plant\ndefense is well established and it is known that pathogen effector proteins encoding\nacetyltransferses can directly acetylate host proteins to alter immunity. However, it is\nunclear whether endogenous plant enzymes can modulate protein acetylation during an\nimmune response. Here we investigate how the effector molecule HC-toxin, a histone\ndeacetylase inhibitor, produced by Cochliobolus carbonum race 1 promotes pathogen\nvirulence in maize through altering protein acetylation. Using mass spectrometry we\nglobally quantified the abundance of 3,636 proteins and the levels of acetylation at 2,791\nsites in maize plants treated with HC-toxin as well as HC-toxin deficient or producing\nstrains of C. carbonum. Analyses of these data demonstrate that acetylation is a\nwidespread post-translational modification impacting proteins encoded by many\nintensively studied maize genes. Furthermore, the application of exogenous HC-toxin\nenabled us to show that the activity of plant-encoded enzymes can be modulated to alter\nacetylation of non-histone proteins during an immune response.
