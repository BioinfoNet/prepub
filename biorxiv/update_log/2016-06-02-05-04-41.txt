Pteris vittata, also known as Chinese ladder brake, was the first identified arsenic hyperaccumulating fern with the capability to convert [As(V)] to arsenite [As(III)]. This study aims at sequence analysis of the most important protein of the arsenic reduction mechanism in this specie. Phosphorylation potential of the protein along with possible interplay of phosphorylation with O-beta-GlcNAcylation was predicted using neural network based webservers. Secondary and tertiary structure of arsenate reductase was then analysed. Active site region of the protein comprised a rhodanese-like domain. Cursory dynamics simulation revealed that folds remained conserved in the rhodanese main but variations were observed in the structure in other regions. This information sheds light on the various characteristics of the protein and may be useful to enzymologists working on the improvement of its traits for arsenic reduction.', u'/content/early/2016/06/01/056036', [], [u'Fatima Jinnah Women University, Rawalpindi 46000, Pakistan;', u'Forman Christain College (A Chartered University), Lahore 54600, Pakistan']]

We combine magnetoencephalographic (MEG) measures of neural processing speed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of white- and gray-matter in a large (N=617, 18-88yrs), population-derived cohort (www.cam-can.org) to investigate the relationship between age-related structural differences and visual and auditory evoked response delay. Using a novel technique, we show that visual-evoked responses exhibit a constant delay, whereas auditory-evoked responses exhibit delay that accumulates over time. Visual delay is mediated by white-matter microstructure in the optic radiation, presumably reflecting increased transmission time, whereas auditory delay is mediated by gray-matter differences in auditory cortex, presumably reflecting less efficient local processing.

The structure of C3(H2O) has not been determined. Here we subjected C3(H2O) to quantitative cross-linking/mass spectrometry (QCLMS). This revealed details of the structural differences and similarities between C3(H2O) and C3, as well as between C3(H2O) and its pivotal proteolytic cleavage product, C3b, which shares functionally similarity with C3(H2O). Considered in combination with the crystal structures of C3 and C3b, the QCMLS data suggest that C3(H2O) generation is accompanied by the migration of the thioester-containing domain of C3 from one end of the molecule to the other. This creates a stable C3b-like platform able to bind the zymogen, factor B, or the regulator, factor H. Integration of available crystallographic and QCLMS data allowed the determination of a 3D model of the C3(H2O) domain architecture. The unique arrangement of domains thus observed in C3(H2O), which retains the anaphylatoxin domain (that is excised when C3 is enzymatically activated to C3b), can be used to rationalize observed differences between C3(H2O) and C3b in terms of complement activation and regulation.', u'/content/early/2016/06/01/056457', [], [u'University of Edinburgh;', u'Unite de Bioinformatique Structurale;', u'University of California']]

However, the stability of anticorrelations across distinct DN subsystems, different contexts, and time, remains unexplored. Here we examine DN-DAN functional connectivity across six different cognitive states. We show that: (i) the DAN is anticorrelated with the DN core subsystem, but not with the two DN subsystems involved in mentalizing and mnemonic functions, respectively; (ii) DN-DAN interactions vary significantly across cognitive states; (iii) DN-DAN connectivity fluctuates across time between periods of anticorrelation and periods of positive correlation; and (iv) coupling between the frontoparietal control network (FPCN) and DAN predicts variation in the strength of DN-DAN anticorrelation across time. These findings reveal substantial variability in DN-DAN interactions, suggesting that these networks are not strictly competitive, and that the FPCN may act to modulate their anticorrelation strength.', u'/content/early/2016/06/01/056424', [], [u'University of British Columbia;', u'University of Colorado Boulder;', u'Cornell University;', u'UC Berkeley']]
[u'Breaking bud: probing the scalability limits of phylogenetic network inference methods', ['Hussein A Hejase', 'Kevin J Liu'], u'June 1, 2016.', u'Background: Branching events in phylogenetic trees reflect strictly bifurcating and/or multifurcating speciation and splitting events. In the presence of gene flow, a phylogeny cannot be described by a tree but is instead a directed acyclic graph known as a phylogenetic network. Both phylogenetic trees and networks are typically reconstructed using computational analysis of multi-locus sequence data. The advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies has brought about two main scalability challenges: (1) dataset size in terms of the number of taxa and (2) the evolutionary divergence of the taxa in a study. The impact of both dimensions of scale on phylogenetic tree inference has been well characterized by recent studies; in contrast, the scalability limits of phylogenetic network inference methods are largely unknown. In this study, we quantify the performance of state-of-the-art phylogenetic network inference methods on large-scale datasets using empirical data sampled from natural mouse populations and synthetic data capturing a wide range of evolutionary scenarios.\n\nResults: We find that, as in the case of phylogenetic tree inference, the performance of leading network inference methods is negatively impacted by both dimensions of dataset scale. In general, we found that topological accuracy degrades as the number of taxa increases; a similar effect was observed with increased sequence mutation rate. The most accurate methods were probabilistic inference methods which maximize either likelihood under coalescent-based models or pseudo-likelihood approximations to the model likelihood. Furthermore, probabilistic inference methods with optimization criteria which did not make use of gene tree root and/or branch length information performed best - a result that runs contrary to widely held assumptions in the literature. The improved accuracy obtained with probabilistic inference methods comes at a computational cost in terms of runtime and main memory usage, which quickly become prohibitive as dataset size grows past thirty taxa.\n\nConclusions: We conclude that the state of the art of phylogenetic network inference lags well behind the scope of current phylogenomic studies. New algorithmic development is critically needed to address this methodological gap.', u'/content/early/2016/06/01/056572', [u'Bioinformatics'], [u'Michigan State University']]
[u'Reproducible Computational Workflows with Continuous Analysis', ['Brett K Beaulieu-Jones', 'Casey S Greene'], u'June 1, 2016.', u'Reproducing experiments is vital to science. Being able to replicate, validate and extend previous work also speeds new research projects. Reproducing computational biology experiments, which are scripted, should be straightforward. But reproducing such work remains challenging and time consuming. In the ideal world we would be able to quickly and easily rewind to the precise computing environment where results were generated. We would then be able to reproduce the original analysis or perform new analyses. We introduce a process termed "continuous analysis" which provides inherent reproducibility to computational research at a minimal cost to the researcher. Continuous analysis combines Docker, a container service similar to virtual machines, with continuous integration, a popular software development technique, to automatically re-run computational analysis whenever relevant changes are made to the source code. This allows results to be reproduced quickly, accurately and without needing to contact the original authors. Continuous analysis also provides an audit trail for analyses that use data with sharing restrictions. This allows reviewers, editors, and readers to verify reproducibility without manually downloading and rerunning any code.', u'/content/early/2016/06/01/056473', [u'Bioinformatics'], [u'University of Pennsylvania']]
[u'iSUMO - integrative prediction of functionally relevant SUMOylated proteins', ['Xiaotong Yao', 'Rebecca Bish', 'Christine Vogel'], u'June 1, 2016.', u'Post-translational modifications by the Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier (SUMO) are essential for many eukaryotic cellular functions. Several large-scale experimental datasets and sequence-based predictions exist that identify SUMOylated proteins. However, the overlap between these datasets is small, suggesting many false positives with low functional relevance. Therefore, we applied machine learning techniques to a diverse set of large-scale SUMOylation studies combined with protein characteristics such as cellular function and protein-protein interactions, to provide integrated SUMO predictions for human and yeast cells (iSUMO). Protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions prove to be highly predictive of protein SUMOylation, supporting a role of the modification in protein complex formation. We note the marked prevalence of SUMOylation amongst RNA-binding proteins. We predict 1,596 and 492 SUMO targets in human and yeast, respectively (5% false positive rate, FPR), which is five times more than what existing sequence-based tools predict at the same FPR. One third of the predictions are validated by an independent, high-quality dataset. iSUMO therefore represents a comprehensive SUMO prediction tool for human and yeast with a high probability for functional relevance of the predictions.', u'/content/early/2016/06/01/056564', [u'Systems Biology'], [u'Weill Cornell Medicine;', u'New York University']]

Direct visualization of yeast nuclear densities shows no evidence of 30-nm chromatin fibers. Aside from pre-ribosomes and spindle microtubules, few nuclear structures are larger than a tetranucleosome.

We evaluate this change in gene expression in 8 different cancer lines by comparing their expression profiles to that of their associated differentiated tissues as well as profiles for proliferative human embryonic stem cells. We find that, for non-proliferative tissues, the alterations in expression after oncogenesis result in a profile that is significantly more similar to the embryonic expression profile than to the original tissue profile. We also find that the lists of co-similar genes among embryonic and tumor cells are clustered within gene regulatory, protein interaction and metabolic networks.
