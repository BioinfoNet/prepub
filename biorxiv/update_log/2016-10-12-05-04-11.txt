[u'ssHMM: Extracting intuitive sequence-structure motifs from high-throughput RNA-binding protein data', ['David Heller', 'Ralf Krestel', 'Uwe Ohler', 'Martin Vingron', 'Annalisa Marsico'], u'October 11, 2016.', u'RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play an important role in RNA post-transcriptional regulation and recognize target RNAs via sequence-structure motifs. To which extent RNA structure influences protein binding in the presence or absence of a sequence motif is still poorly understood. Existing RNA motif finders either take the structure of the RNA only partially into account, or produce models which are not directly interpretable as sequence-structure motifs. Thus, a tool which produces informative motifs and at the same time captures the relationship between RNA primary sequence and secondary structure is missing.\n\nWe developed ssHMM, an RNA motif finder that combines a hidden Markov model (HMM) with Gibbs sampling to learn the joint sequence and structure binding preferences of RBPs from high-throughput data, such as CLIP-Seq sequences, and intuitively visualizes them as a graph. Evaluations on synthetic data showed that ssHMM reliably recovers fuzzy sequence motifs in 80 to 100% of the cases, outperforming state-of-the-art methods designed for a similar task. On real data, it produces motifs with higher information content than existing tools. Additionally, ssHMM is considerably faster than other methods on large data sets. We also discuss examples of novel sequence-structure motifs for uncharacterized RBPs which could be  identified by ssHMM. ssHMM is freely available on Github.', u'/content/early/2016/10/11/076034', [], [u'Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics Berlin Germany;', u'Hasso Plattner Institute Potsdam Germany;', u'Max Delbruck Center Berlin Germany;', u'Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics']]
[u'Origins and Global Context of Brucella abortus in Italy', ['Giuliano Garofolo', 'Elisabetta Di Giannatale', 'Ilenia Platone', 'Katiuscia Zilli', 'Lorena Sacchini', 'Anna Abbas', 'Massimo Ancora', 'Cesare Camm&aacute', 'Guido Di Donato', 'Fabrizio De Massis', 'Paolo Calistri', 'Kevin Drees', 'Jeffrey Foster'], u'October 11, 2016.', u'Brucellosis is a common and chronic disease of cattle and other bovids that often\ncauses reproductive disorders. Natural infection in cattle is caused by Brucella abortus\nand transmission typically occurs during abortions, calving, or nursing. Brucellosis is\nalso a major zoonotic disease due to contamination of dairy products or contact with\nthe tissues of infected animals. Brucellosis has been eradicated from most of the\ndeveloped world in the last forty years but persists in many regions; B. abortus remains\nprevalent in portions of Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and Central and South America,\nas well as in the Mediterranean basin. Specifically, B. abortus has persisted in\nsouthern Italy in both cattle and water buffalo. Previous attempts at analyzing the\ngenetic structure of B. abortus in Italy have been challenging due to the limited genetic\nvariability and unresolved global population structure of this pathogen.\nWe conducted genome-wide phylogenetic analysis on 11 representative strains of B.\nabortus from Italy, and compared these sequences to a worldwide collection of\npublically available genomes. Italian isolates belong to three clades basal to the global\nB. abortus lineage. Using six assays designed to identify substructure within the Italian\nclades in a collection of 261 isolates, one clade predominates throughout endemic\ndistricts in the country, while the other two clades are more geographically restricted to\nsouthern Italy.\nAlthough related strains exist worldwide, B. abortus isolates from Italy are substantially\ndifferent than those found in much of the rest of Europe and North America, and are\nmore closely related to strains from the Middle East and Asia. Our assays targeting\ngenetic substructure within Italy allowed us to identify the major lineages quickly and\ninexpensively, without having to generate whole genome sequences for a large isolate\ncollection. These findings highlight the importance of genetic studies to assess the\nstatus and the history of pathogens.', u'/content/early/2016/10/11/077529', [], [u'Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale del\'Abruzzo e del Molise "G.

[u'Recall without Hippocampal Engagement', ['David Ross', 'Patrick Sadil', 'Merika Wilson', 'Rosemary Cowell'], u'October 11, 2016.', u'The hippocampus is considered pivotal to recall, allowing retrieval of information not available in the immediate environment. In contrast, neocortex is thought to signal familiarity, and to contribute to recall only when called upon by the hippocampus. However, this view is not compatible with representational accounts of memory, which reject the mapping of cognitive processes onto brain regions. According to representational accounts, the hippocampus is not engaged by recall per se, rather it is engaged whenever hippocampal representations are required. To test whether hippocampus is engaged by recall when hippocampal representations are not required, we used functional imaging and a non-associative recall task, with items (objects, scenes) studied in isolation, and item-parts used as cues. As predicted by a representational account, hippocampal activation increased during recall of scenes, which are known to be processed by hippocampus, but not during recall of objects. Object recall instead engaged neocortical regions known to be involved in object-processing. Further supporting the representational account, effective connectivity analyses revealed that recall was associated with increased information flow out of lateral occipital cortex (object recall) and parahippocampal cortex (scene recall), suggesting that recall related activation spread from neocortex to hippocampus, not the reverse.', u'/content/early/2016/10/11/080309', [], [u'University of Massachusetts Amherst']]
