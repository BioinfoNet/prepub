[u'Comparison of Principal Component Analysis and t-Stochastic Neighbor Embedding with Distance Metric Modifications for Single-cell RNA-sequencing Data Analysis', ['Haejoon Kwon', 'Jean Fan', 'Peter Kharchenko'], u'January 24, 2017.', u'Recent developments in technological tools such as next generation sequencing along with peaking interest in the study of single cells has enabled single-cell RNA-sequencing, in which whole transcriptomes are analyzed on a single-cell level. Studies, however, have been hindered by the ability to effectively analyze these single cell RNA-seq datasets, due to the high-dimensional nature and intrinsic noise in the data. While many techniques have been introduced to reduce dimensionality of such data for visualization and subpopulation identification, the utility to identify new cellular subtypes in a reliable and robust manner remains unclear. Here, we compare dimensionality reduction visualization methods including principle component analysis and t-stochastic neighbor embedding along with various distance metric modifications to visualize single-cell RNA-seq datasets, and assess their performance in identifying known cellular subtypes. Our results suggest that selecting variable genes prior to analysis on single-cell RNA-seq data is vital to yield reliable classification, and that when variable genes are used, the choice of distance metric modification does not particularly influence the quality of classification. Still, in order to take advantage of all the gene expression information, alternative methods must be used for a reliable classification.', u'/content/early/2017/01/24/102780', [u'Bioinformatics'], [u'Emory University;', u'Harvard University']]

Partial structures of VEGFR/VEGF complexes based on single particle electron microscopy, small angle X-ray scattering, and X-ray crystallography revealed the location of VEGF binding and domain arrangement of individual receptor subdomains. Here we describe the structure of the full-length VEGFR-1 extracellular domain (ECD) in complex with VEGF-A at 4 \xc5 resolution. We combined X-ray crystallography, single 9 particle electron microscopy, and molecular modeling for structure determination and validation. The structure reveals the molecular details of ligand-induced receptor dimerization, in particular of homotypic receptor interactions in Ig-domains 4, 5, and 7. Functional analyses of ligand binding and receptor activation confirm the relevance of these homotypic contacts and identify them as potential therapeutic sites to allosterically inhibit VEGFR-1 activity.', u'/content/early/2017/01/24/102822', [u'Biochemistry'], [u'Paul Scherrer Institute;', u'Biozentrum;', u'National Center for Biotechnology Information;', u'Center for Cellular Imaging and Nano Analytics']]
[u'Ecological and demographic drivers of jellyfish blooms', ['Josephine Goldstein', 'Ulrich K Steiner'], u'January 24, 2017.', u'Jellyfish blooms are conspicuous demographic events with significant ecological and socio-economic impact, as they alter aquatic food webs. Despite worldwide concern about an increased frequency and intensity of jellyfish outbreaks, we are challenged to predict their booms and busts. To overcome this issue, we need to identify the ecological drivers of jellyfish blooms by taking into account the complex life cycle of scyphozoans (Cnidaria). Here we present demographic rates of all life stages of the cosmopolitan jellyfish Aurelia aurita s. l. within a stage-structured matrix model to investigate the life stage-dynamics of such complex populations under different environments. We illustrate how booms and busts of the medusa stage are highly influenced by non-medusa stage dynamics. We further point out increased food availability as an important ecological driver of jellyfish blooms, as it can shift the population structure of A. aurita away from the benthic polyp stage towards more medusae. Comparatively, our projected climate change scenario caused low fluctuations in population density. Overall, our study reveals ecological and demographic key variables that regulate the intensity and frequency of jellyfish blooms, and thereby contributes to a better understanding of anthropogenic drivers of jellyfish mass occurrence, including habitat eutrophication and climate change.', u'/content/early/2017/01/24/102814', [u'Ecology'], [u'University of Southern Denmark']]

We here provide quantitative estimates of the transmissibility of primary infection, reactivation, and re-infection using age- and sex-specific antibody response data. The data are optimally described by three distributions of antibody measurements, i.e. uninfected, infected, and infected after reactivation/re-infection. Estimates of seroprevalence increase gradually with age, such that at 80 years 73% (95%CrI: 64%-78%) of females and 62% (95%CrI: 55%-68%) of males is infected, while 57% (95%CrI: 47%-67%) of females and 37% (95%CrI: 28%-46%) of males has experienced a reactivation or re-infection episode. Merging the statistical analyses with transmission models, we find that infectious reactivation is key to provide a good fit fit to the data. Estimated reactivation rates increase from low values in children to 2%-6% per year older women. The results advance a hypothesis in which adult-to-adult transmission after infectious reactivation is the main driver of infection.', u'/content/early/2017/01/24/102491', [u'Epidemiology'], [u'National Institute for Public Health and the Environment;', u'Utrecht University;', u'Leiden University Medical Center']]
[u'Phylodynamics without trees: estimating R0 directly from pathogen sequences', ['Giacomo Plazzotta', 'Caroline Colijn'], u'January 24, 2017.', u'We develop a new tree-free phylodynamic method to estimate the reproduction number (R0) of a pathogen from large numbers of sequences of a pathogen. It is based on the convergence of the cherry-to-tip ratio (CTR) to a constant depending on R0 in supercritical branching trees. It is a tree-free method because tree reconstruction is not required: the number of cherries and the CTR is estimated directly from the sequences using the new computational method Cherries Without Tree (CWT). With simulations, we compare CWT to other methods currently in use. We use the new inference method to estimate R0 from simulated sequences and discuss its accuracy. We explore the potential bias arising from sub-sampling.', u'/content/early/2017/01/24/102061', [u'Epidemiology'], [u'Imperial College London']]
[u'Sex differences in the epidemiology of tattoo skin disease in captive common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus): are males more vulnerable than females?', ['Marie-Francoise Van Bressem', 'Koen Van Waerebeek', 'Padraig J Duignan'], u'January 24, 2017.', u"The clinical and epidemiological features of tattoo skin disease (TSD), caused by cetacean poxviruses, are reported in 257 common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) held in 31 facilities in the USA and Europe. Photographs and biological data of 146 females and 111 males were analyzed. Dolphins were classified into three age classes (0-3; 4-8; over 9 years), approximating the life stages of 'calves and young juveniles', 'juveniles and sub-adults' and 'adults'. The youngest dolphins with tattoos were 14 and 15 months old. Minimal TSD persistence varied between 4 and 65 months in 30 dolphins and was over 22 months in those with very large lesions (> 115 mm). In 2012-2014, 20.6% of the 257 dolphins had TSD. Prevalence varied between facilities from 5.6% (n= 18) to 60% (n= 20), possibly reflecting variation in environmental conditions. Prevalence was significantly higher in males (31.5%) than in females (12.3%), a pattern which departs from that observed in free-ranging Delphinidae where there is no gender bias. As with free-ranging Delphinidae, TSD prevalence in captive females varied with age category, being the highest in the 4 to 8 year old. By contrast, prevalence levels in males were high in all age classes. Prevalence of very large tattoos was also higher in males (28.6%, n= 35) than in females (11.1%, n= 18). Combined, these data suggest that captive male T. truncatus are more vulnerable to TSD than females possibly because of differences in immune response and because males may be more susceptible to captivity-related stress than females.", u'/content/early/2017/01/24/101915', [u'Epidemiology'], [u'Peruvian Centre for Cetacean Research;', u'The Marine Mammal Center, 2000 Bunker Road, Fort Cronkhite, Sausalito, CA 94965, USA']]
[u'Metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing Detects Pulmonary Pathogens in Hematopoietic Cellular Transplant Patients with Acute Respiratory Illnesses', ['Charles Langelier', 'Matt S Zinter', 'Katrina Kalantar', 'Gregory A Yank', 'Stephanie Christenson', 'Brian Odonovan', 'Corin White', 'Michael R Wilson', 'Anil Sapru', 'Christopher C Dvorak', 'Steve Miller', 'Charles Y Chiu', 'Joseph L DeRisi'], u'January 24, 2017.', u'BACKGROUND: Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) are a leading cause of mortality in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. Current microbiologic diagnostics often fail to identify etiologic pathogens, leading to diagnostic uncertainty and precluding the implementation of targeted therapies. To directly address the need for improved LRTI diagnostics, we undertook this study to evaluate the potential utility of metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS) approaches for detecting LRTI in the HCT population.  METHODS: We enrolled 22 post-HCT adults ages 19-69 years with acute respiratory illnesses who underwent bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) at the University of Michigan between January 2012 and May 2013. Unbiased mNGS was performed on BAL fluid to detect microbes and assess host response. Results were compared to those obtained by standard clinical microbiology testing.  RESULTS: Unbiased mNGS detected all microbes identified by standard testing (human metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, human herpesvirus 6 and cytomegalovirus).  Previously unrecognized LRTI pathogens were identified in six patients for whom standard testing was negative (human coronavirus 229E, human rhinovirus A, Corynebacterium propinquum and Streptococcus mitis) and findings were confirmed by independent PCR testing. mNGS identified microbes of unlikely or uncertain pathogenicity in 10 patients with clinical evidence of non-infectious respiratory conditions. Patients with respiratory pathogens were found to have significantly increased expression of immunity related gene biomarkers relative to those without (p=0.022) as well as lower alpha diversity of their respiratory microbial communities (p=0.017).  CONCLUSIONS: Compared to conventional diagnostics, host/pathogen mNGS enhanced detection of microbial pathogens in BAL fluid from HCT patients.  Furthermore, this approach simultaneously evaluated the association between identified microbes and the expression of innate immunity gene biomarkers. Host/pathogen mNGS holds promise for precision diagnosis of post-HCT respiratory infection.', u'/content/early/2017/01/24/102798', [u'Genomics'], [u'University of California San Francisco;', u'University of Michigan;', u'University of California Los Angeles']]
