[u'Drosophila poised enhancers are generated during tissue patterning with the help of repression', ['Nina Koenecke', 'Jeff Johnston', 'Qiye He', 'Julia Zeitlinger'], u'May 7, 2016.', u'Histone modifications are frequently used as markers for enhancer states, but how to interpret enhancer states in the context of embryonic development is not clear. The poised enhancer signature, involving H3K4me1 and low levels of H3K27ac, has been reported to mark inactive enhancers that are poised for future activation. However, future activation is not always observed and alternative reasons for the widespread occurrence of this enhancer signature have not been investigated. By analyzing enhancers during dorsal-ventral (DV) axis formation in the Drosophila embryo, we find that the poised enhancer signature is specifically generated during patterning in the tissue where the enhancers are not induced, including at enhancers that are known to be repressed by a transcriptional repressor. These results suggest that, rather than serving simply as an intermediate step before future activation, the poised enhancer state may mark enhancers for spatial activation during tissue patterning. We discuss the possibility that the poised enhancer state is more generally the result of repression by transcriptional repressors.', u'/content/early/2016/05/07/052142', [], [u'Stowers Institute for Medical Research;', u'Department of Basic Medicine; School of Medical Sciences; Zhejiang University; Hangzhou, Zhejiang Pr']]
[u'Transcriptomic analysis of diplomonad parasites reveals a trans-spliced intron in a helicase gene in Giardia', ['Scott William Roy'], u'May 7, 2016.', u'Gene expression is the central preoccupation of molecular biology, thus newly discovered facets of gene expression are of great interest.  Recently, ourselves and others reported that in the diplomonad protist Giardia lamblia, the coding regions of several mRNAs are produced by ligation of independent RNA species expressed from distinct genomic loci.  Such trans-splicing of introns was found to affect nearly as many genes in this organism as does classical cis-splicing of introns.  These findings raised questions about the incidence of intron trans-splicing both across the G. lamblia transcriptome and across diplomonad diversity, however a dearth of transcriptomic data at the time prohibited systematic study of these questions.  Here, I leverage newly available transcriptomic data from G. lamblia and the related diplomonad Spironucleus salmonicida to search for trans-spliced introns.  My computational pipeline recovers all four previously reported trans-spliced introns in G. lamblia, suggesting good sensitivity.  Scrutiny of thousands of potential cases revealed only a single additional trans-spliced intron in G. lamblia, in the p68 helicase gene, and no cases in S. salmonicida.  The p68 intron differs from the previously reported trans-spliced introns in its high degree of streamlining: the core features of G. lamblia trans-spliced introns closely packed together, revealing striking efficiency in the implementation of a seemingly inherently inefficient molecular mechanism.  These results serve to circumscribe the role of trans-splicing both in terms of genes effected and taxonomically.  Future work should focus on the molecular mechanisms, evolutionary origins and phenotypic implications of this intriguing phenomenon.', u'/content/early/2016/05/07/052134', [], [u'San Francisco State University']]
[u'Localized structural frustration for evaluating the impact of sequence variants', ['Sushant Kumar', 'Declan Clarke', 'Mark Gerstein'], u'May 7, 2016.', u'The rapidly declining costs of sequencing human genomes and exomes are providing deeper insights into genomic variation than previously possible. Growing sequence datasets are uncovering large numbers of rare single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in coding regions, many of which may even be unique to single individuals. The rarity of such variants makes it difficult to use conventional variant-phenotype associations as a means of predicting their potential impacts. As such, protein structures may help to provide the needed means for inferring otherwise difficult-to-discern rare SNV-phenotype associations. Previous efforts have sought to quantify the effects of SNVs on structures by evaluating their impacts on global stability. However, local perturbations can severely impact functionality (such as catalysis,allosteric regulation, interactions and specificity) without strongly disrupting global stability.Here, we describe a workflow in which localized frustration (which quantifies unfavorable residue-residue interactions) is employed as a metric to investigate such effects. We apply frustration to study the impacts of a large number of SNVs available throughout a number of next-generation sequencing datasets. Most of our observations are intuitively consistent: we observe that disease-associated SNVs have a strong proclivity to induce strong changes in localized frustration, and rare variants tend to disrupt local interactions to a larger extent than do common variants. Furthermore, we observe that somatic SNVs associated with oncogenes induce stronger perturbations at the surface, whereas those associated with tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) induce stronger perturbations in the interior. These findings are consistent with the notion that gain-of-function (for oncogenes) and loss-of-function events (for TSGs) may act through changes in regulatory interactions and basic functionality, respectively.', u'/content/early/2016/05/07/052027', [], [u'Yale University']]
[u'Evolutionary dynamics of chloroplast genomes in low light: a case study of the endolithic green alga Ostreobium quekettii', ['Vanessa R. Marcelino', 'Ma Chiela M. Cremen', 'Christopher J. Jackson', 'Anthony W.D. Larkum', 'Heroen Verbruggen'], u'May 7, 2016.', u'Some photosynthetic organisms live in extremely low light environments. Light limitation is associated with selective forces as well as reduced exposure to mutagens, and over evolutionary timescales it can leave a footprint on species genome.  Here we present the chloroplast genomes of four green algae (Bryopsidales, Ulvophyceae), including the endolithic (limestone-boring) alga Ostreobium quekettii, which is a low light specialist. We use phylogenetic models and comparative genomic tools to investigate whether the chloroplast genome of Ostreobium corresponds to our expectations of how low light would affect genome evolution. Ostreobium has the smallest and most gene-dense chloroplast genome among Ulvophyceae reported to date, matching our expectation that light limitation would impose resource constraints. Rates of molecular evolution are significantly slower along the phylogenetic branch leading to Ostreobium, in agreement with the expected effects of low light and energy levels on molecular evolution. Given the exceptional ability of our model organism to photosynthesize under extreme low light conditions, we expected to observe positive selection in genes related to the photosynthetic machinery. However, we observed stronger purifying selection in these genes, which might either reflect a lack of power to detect episodic positive selection followed by purifying selection and/or a strengthening of purifying selection due to the loss of a gene related to light sensitivity. Besides shedding light on the genome dynamics associated with a low light lifestyle, this study helps to resolve the role of environmental factors in shaping the diversity of genome architectures observed in nature.', u'/content/early/2016/05/07/049833', [], [u'University of Melbourne;', u'University of Technology Sydney']]
[u'Adaptation in isolated populations: when does it happen and when can we tell?', ['Jessica Crisci', 'Matthew D Dean', 'Peter L. Ralph'], u'May 7, 2016.', u'Isolated populations with novel phenotypes present an exciting opportunity to\nuncover the genetic basis of ecologically significant adaptation, and genomic\nscans for positive selection in such populations have often, but not always,\nled to candidate genes directly related to an adaptive phenotype. However, in\nmany cases these populations were established by a severe bottleneck, which can\nmake identifying targets of selection problematic. Here we simulate severe\nbottlenecks and subsequent selection on standing variation, mimicking\nadaptation after establishment of a new small population, such as an island or\nan artificial selection experiment. Using simulations of single loci under\npositive selection and population genetics theory, we examine how population\nsize and age of the population isolate affects the ability of outlier scans for\nselection to identify adaptive alleles using both single site measures and\nhaplotype structure. We find and explain an optimal combination of selection\nstrength, starting frequency, and age of the adaptive allele, which we refer to\nas a Goldilocks zone, where adaptation is likely to occur, and yet the adaptive\nvariants are most likely to derive from a single ancestor (a "hard" selective\nsweep) ; in this zone, four commonly used statistics detect selection with high\npower. Real-world examples of both island colonization and experimental\nevolution studies are discussed.

Here we introduce the Singleton Density Score (SDS), a powerful measure to infer very recent changes in allele frequencies from contemporary genome sequences. When applied to data from the UK10K Project, SDS reflects allele frequency changes in the ancestors of modern Britons during the past 2,000 years. We see strong signals of selection at lactase and HLA, and in favor of blond hair and blue eyes. Turning to signals of polygenic adaptation we find, remarkably, that recent selection for increased height has driven allele frequency shifts across most of the genome. Moreover, we report suggestive new evidence for polygenic shifts affecting many other complex traits. Our results suggest that polygenic adaptation has played a pervasive role in shaping genotypic and phenotypic variation in modern humans.', u'/content/early/2016/05/07/052084', [u'Genetics'], [u'Stanford University; Howard Hughes Medical Institute;', u'Stanford University;', u'Stanford University; Wellcome Trust Center for Human Genetics;', u'Univ.

[u'Gene- and pathway-based association tests for multiple traits with GWAS summary statistics', ['Il-Youp Kwak', 'Wei Pan'], u'May 7, 2016.', u'To identify novel genetic variants associated with complex traits and to shed new insights on underlying biology in addition to the most popular single SNP-single trait association analysis, it would be useful to explore multiple correlated (intermediate) traits at the gene- or pathway-level by mining existing single GWAS or meta-analyzed GWAS data. For this purpose,\nwe present an adaptive gene-based test and a pathway-based test for association analysis of multiple traits with GWAS summary statistics. The proposed tests are adaptive at both the SNP- and trait-levels;\nthat is, they account for possibly varying association patterns (e.g. signal sparsity levels) across SNPs and traits, thus maintaining high power across a wide range of situations. Furthermore, the proposed methods are general: they can be applied to mixed types of traits, and to Z-statistics or p-values as summary statistics obtained from either a single GWAS or a meta-analysis of multiple GWAS. Our numerical studies with simulated and real data demonstrated the promising performance of the proposed methods.\n\nThe methods are implemented in R package aSPU, freely and publicly\navailable on CRAN.', u'/content/early/2016/05/07/052068', [u'Bioinformatics'], [u'University of Minnesota']]
[u'Denoising genome-wide histone ChIP-seq with convolutional neural networks', ['Pang Wei Koh', 'Emma Pierson', 'Anshul Kundaje'], u'May 7, 2016.', u'Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments targeting histone modifications are commonly used to characterize the dynamic epigenomes of diverse cell types and tissues. However, suboptimal experimental parameters such as poor ChIP enrichment, low cell input, low library complexity, and low sequencing depth can significantly affect the quality and sensitivity of histone ChIP-seq experiments. We show that a convolutional neural network trained to learn a mapping between suboptimal and high-quality histone ChIP-seq data in reference cell types can overcome various sources of noise and substantially enhance signal when applied to low-quality samples across individuals, cell types, and species. This approach allows us to reduce cost and increase data quality. More broadly, our approach -- using a high-dimensional discriminative model to encode a generative noise process -- is generally applicable to biological problems where it is easy to generate noisy data but difficult to analytically characterize the noise or underlying data distribution.', u'/content/early/2016/05/07/052118', [u'Bioinformatics'], [u'Stanford University']]
[u'Use of multiple picosecond high-mass molecular dynamics simulations to predict crystallographic B-factors of folded globular proteins', ['Yuan-Ping Pang'], u'May 7, 2016.', u'It is challenging to predict crystallographic B-factors of a protein from a conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. This is partly because the B-factors calculated through sampling the atomic positional fluctuations in a picosecond MD simulation are unreliable, and longer samplings often yield substantially large root mean square deviations (RMSDs) between calculated and experimental B-factors. This article reports the use of uniformly increased atomic masses by 100-fold to increase the time resolution of an MD simulation so that sampling the atomic positional fluctuations in multiple picosecond MD simulations with such high masses can improve the B-factor prediction. Using the third immunoglobulin-binding domain of protein G, bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, ubiquitin, and lysozyme as model systems, the C\u03b1 and C\u03b3 B-factor RMSDs of these proteins were ranging from 3.1\xb10.2 \xc52 to 9.2\xb10.8 \xc52 or from 3.6\xb10.1 \xc52 to 9.6\xb10.2 \xc52, respectively, when the sampling was done, for each of these proteins, in 20 distinct, independent, and 50-picosecond high-mass MD simulations using AMBER forcefield FF12MC or FF14SB. These results suggest that sampling the atomic positional fluctuations in multiple picosecond high-mass MD simulations may be conducive to a priori prediction of crystallographic B-factors of a folded protein.', u'/content/early/2016/05/07/052126', [u'Biophysics'], [u'Mayo Clinic']]
