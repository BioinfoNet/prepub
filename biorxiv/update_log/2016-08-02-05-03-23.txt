[u'Small molecules with antibiofilm, antivirulence and antibiotic synergy activities against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.', ['Erik van Tilburg Bernardes', 'Laetitia Charron-Mazenod', 'David Reading', 'Shauna L Reckseidler-Zenteno', 'Shawn Lewenza'], u'August 1, 2016.', u'Biofilm formation is a universal bacterial strategy for long-term survival in nature and during infections. Biofilms are dense microbial communities enmeshed within a polymeric extracellular matrix that protects bacteria from antibiotic exposure and the immune system and thus contribute to chronic infections. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an archetypal biofilm-forming organism that utilizes a biofilm growth strategy to cause chronic lung infections in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients. The extracellular matrix of P. aeruginosa biofilms is comprised mainly of exopolysaccharides (EPS) and DNA. Both mucoid and non-mucoid isolates of P. aeruginosa produces the Pel and Psl EPS, each of which have important roles in antibiotic resistance, biofilm formation and immune evasion. Given the central importance of the Pel and Psl EPS in biofilm structure, they are attractive targets for novel anti-infective compounds. In this study we used a high throughput gene expression screen to identify compounds that repress expression of pel and psl genes as measured by transcriptional lux fusions. Testing of the pel/psl repressors demonstrated an antibiofilm activity against microplate and flow chamber biofilms formed by wild type and hyperbiofilm forming strains. To determine the potential role of EPS in virulence, mutants in pel/psl were shown to have reduced virulence in the feeding behavior and slow killing virulence assays in Caenorhabditis elegans. The antibiofilm molecules also reduced P. aeruginosa PAO1 virulence in the nematode slow killing model. Importantly, the combination of antibiotics and antibiofilm compounds were synergistic in killing P. aeruginosa biofilms. These small molecules represent a novel anti-infective strategy for the possible treatment of chronic P. aeruginosa infections.', u'/content/early/2016/08/01/067074', [], [u'University of Calgary;', u'Athabasca University']]
[u'Population cycles and species diversity in dynamic Kill-the-Winner model of microbial ecosystems', ['sergei maslov', 'kim snepppen'], u'August 1, 2016.', u'Determinants of species diversity in microbial ecosystems remain \npoorly understood. Bacteriophages are \nbelieved to increase the diversity\nby the virtue of Kill-the-Winner infection bias \npreventing the fastest growing organism from taking over \nthe community. \nPhage-bacterial ecosystems are traditionally  \ndescribed in terms of the \nstatic equilibrium state of Lotka-Volterra equations \nin which bacterial growth is exactly balanced by \nlosses due to phage predation. Here we consider a \nmore dynamic scenario in which phage infections \ngive rise to abrupt and severe collapses of\nbacterial populations whenever they become sufficiently large.  \nAs a consequence, each bacterial population in our model \nfollows cyclic dynamics of exponential growth interrupted by \nsudden declines.\nThe total population of all species fluctuates around \nthe carrying capacity of the environment, \nmaking these cycles cryptic. \nWhile a subset of the slowest growing species in our model \nis always driven towards extinction, in general \nthe overall ecosystem diversity remains high. The number of surviving species \nis inversely proportional to the variation in their growth rates  \nbut increases with the frequency and severity of phage-induced \ncollapses. Thus counter-intuitively we predict that \nmicrobial communities exposed to more violent \nperturbations should have higher diversity.', u'/content/early/2016/08/01/067124', [], [u'University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign;', u'Niels Bohr Institute, Copenhagen University']]
[u'Stochastic Assembly Produces Heterogeneous Communities in the C. elegans Intestine', ['Nicole Vega', 'Jeff Gore'], u'August 1, 2016.', u'Host-associated bacterial communities vary extensively between individuals, but it can be very difficult to determine the sources of this heterogeneity. Here we demonstrate that stochastic bacterial community assembly in the C. elegans intestine is sufficient to produce strong inter-worm heterogeneity in community composition. When worms are fed with two neutrally-competing fluorescently labeled bacterial strains, we observe stochastically-driven bimodality in community composition, where approximately half of the worms are dominated by each bacterial strain. A simple model incorporating stochastic colonization suggests that heterogeneity between worms is driven by the low rate at which bacteria successfully establish new intestinal colonies. We can increase this rate experimentally by feeding worms at high bacterial density; in these conditions the bimodality disappears. These results demonstrate the potential importance of stochastic processes in bacterial community formation and suggest a role for C. elegans as a model system for ecology of host-associated communities.', u'/content/early/2016/08/01/067173', [], [u'Massachusetts Institute of Technology']]
[u'A global view of meiotic double-strand break end resection', ['Eleni P. Mimitou', 'Shintaro Yamada', 'Scott Keeney'], u'August 1, 2016.', u'The DNA double-strand breaks that initiate homologous recombination during meiosis are subject to extensive 5\u2032\u21923\u2032 exonucleolytic processing. This resection is a central and conserved feature of recombination, yet its mechanism is poorly understood. Using a purpose-made deep-sequencing method, we mapped meiotic resection endpoints genome-wide at high spatial resolution in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Generating full-length resection tracts requires Exo1 exonuclease activity and the DNA-damage responsive kinase Tel1, but not the helicase Sgs1. Tel1 is also required for efficient and timely initiation of resection. We find that distributions of resection endpoints at individual genomic loci display pronounced heterogeneity that reflects a tendency for nucleosomes to block Exo1 in vivo, yet modeling experiments indicate that Exo1 digests chromatin with high apparent processivity and at rates approaching those for naked DNA in vitro. This paradox points to nucleosome destabilization or eviction as a determining feature of the meiotic resection landscape.', u'/content/early/2016/08/01/067199', [], [u'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center']]
[u'Literature mining supports a next-generation modeling approach to predict cellular byproduct secretion', ['Zachary Andrew King', "Edward J O'Brien", 'Adam M Feist', 'Bernhard O Palsson'], u'August 1, 2016.', u'The metabolic byproducts secreted by growing cells can be easily measured and provide a window into the state of a cell; they have been essential to the development of microbiology, cancer biology, and biotechnology. Progress in computational modeling of cells has made it possible to predict metabolic byproduct secretion with bottom-up reconstructions of metabolic networks. However, owing to a lack of data, it has not been possible to validate these predictions across a wide range of strains and conditions. Through literature mining, we were able to generate a database of Escherichia coli strains and their experimentally measured byproduct secretions. We simulated these strains in six historical genome-scale models of E. coli, and we report that the predictive power of the models has increased as they have expanded in size and scope. Next-generation models of metabolism and gene expression are even more capable than previous models, but parameterization poses new challenges.', u'/content/early/2016/08/01/066944', [], [u'UC San Diego']]

Ray', 'Benedict Paten', 'Louis J Guillette', 'Richard E Green'], u'August 1, 2016.', u'The American alligator, Alligator mississippiensis, like all crocodilians, has temperature-dependent sex determination, in which the sex of an embryo is determined by the incubation temperature of the egg during a critical period of development. The lack of genetic differences between male and female alligators leaves open the question of how the genes responsible for sex determination and differentiation are regulated. One insight into this question comes from the fact that exposing an embryo incubated at male-producing temperature to estrogen causes it to develop ovaries. Because estrogen response elements are known to regulate genes over long distances, a contiguous genome assembly is crucial for predicting and understanding its impact.\n\nWe present an improved assembly of the American alligator genome, scaffolded with in vitro proximity ligation (Chicago) data. We use this assembly to scaffold two other crocodilian genomes based on synteny. We perform RNA sequencing of tissues from American alligator embryos to find genes that are differentially expressed between embryos incubated at male- versus female-producing temperature. Finally, we use the improved contiguity of our assembly along with the current model of CTCF-mediated chromatin looping to predict regions of the genome likely to contain estrogen-responsive genes. We find that these regions are significantly enriched for genes with female-biased expression in developing gonads after the critical period during which sex is determined by incubation temperature. We thus conclude that estrogen signaling is a major driver of female-biased gene expression in the post-temperature sensitive period gonads.', u'/content/early/2016/08/01/067165', [], [u'Biomolecular Engineering, UC Santa Cruz;', u'Hollings Marine Lab., Medical University of South Carolina;', u'Driver Group, LLC;', u'Salk Institute, Laboratory of Genetics;', u'Dept. of Biochemistry, Stanford Univ.;', u'California Inst. for Quantitative Biosciences;', u'Dept. of Biomolecular Engineering, UC Santa Cruz;', u'Biological Sciences, Texas Tech Univ.;', u'Inst. for Genomics, Biocomputing, and Biotech., MS State Univ.;', u'School of Animal and Comp.

[u'Evolutionary thrift: mycobacteria repurpose plasmid diversity during adaptation of type VII secretion systems', ['Tatum D Mortimer', 'Alexandra M. Weber', 'Caitlin S. Pepperell'], u'August 1, 2016.', u'Mycobacteria have a distinct type of secretion system, termed type VII (T7SS), which is encoded by paralogous chromosomal loci (ESX) and associated with pathogenesis, conjugation, metal homeostasis and other functions. Gene duplication is an important mechanism by which novel gene functions can evolve. There are, however, potential conflicts between adaptive forces that stabilize duplicated genes and those that enable the evolution of new functions. Our objective was to delineate the adaptive forces underlying functional diversification of T7SS using genomic data from mycobacteria and related Actinobacteria. Plasmid-borne ESX were described recently, and we found evidence that the initial duplication and divergence of ESX systems occurred on plasmids and was driven by selection for advantageous mutations. We speculate that differentiation of plasmid ESX was driven by development of plasmid incompatibility systems. Plasmid ESX systems appear to have been repurposed following their migration to the chromosome, and there is evidence of positive selection driving further differentiation of the chromosomal ESX. We hypothesize that ESX loci were initially stabilized on the chromosome by mediating their own transfer. These results emphasize the diverse adaptive paths underlying the evolution of novelty, which in this case involved plasmid duplications, selection for advantageous mutations in both the core and mobile genomes, migration of the loci between plasmids and chromosomes, and lateral transfer among chromosomes. We discuss further implications of these results for the choice of model organism to study ESX functions in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.', u'/content/early/2016/08/01/067207', [], [u'University of Wisconsin-Madison']]

[u'Genome-wide biases in the rate and molecular spectrum of spontaneous mutations in Vibrio cholerae and Vibrio fischeri', ['Marcus M Dillon', 'Way Sung', 'Robert Sebra', 'Michael Lynch', 'Vaughn Cooper'], u'August 1, 2016.', u'The vast diversity in nucleotide composition and architecture among bacterial genomes may be partly explained by inherent biases in the rates and spectra of spontaneous mutations. Bacterial genomes with multiple chromosomes are relatively unusual but some are relevant to human health, none more so than the causative agent of cholera, Vibrio cholerae. Here, we present the genome-wide mutation spectra in wild-type and mismatch repair (MMR) defective backgrounds of two Vibrio species, the low-GC% squid symbiont V. fischeri and the pathogen V. cholerae, collected under conditions that greatly minimize the efficiency of natural selection. In apparent contrast to their high diversity in nature, both wild-type V. fischeri and V. cholerae have among the lowest rates for base-substitution mutations (bpsms) and insertion-deletion mutations (indels) that have been measured, below 10-3/genome/generation. V. fischeri and V. cholerae have distinct mutation spectra, but both are AT-biased and produce a surprising number of multi-nucleotide indels. Furthermore, the loss of a functional MMR system caused the mutation spectra of these species to converge, implying that the MMR system itself contributes to species-specific mutation patterns. Bpsm and indel rates varied among genome regions, but do not explain the more rapid evolutionary rates of genes on chromosome 2, which likely result from weaker purifying selection. More generally, the very low mutation rates of Vibrio species correlate inversely with their immense population sizes and suggest that selection may not only have maximized replication fidelity but also optimized other polygenic traits relative to the constraints of genetic drift.', u'/content/early/2016/08/01/066829', [u'Genetics'], [u'University of New Hampshire;', u'University of North Carolina, Charlotte;', u'Icahn School of Medicine at Mt.

[u'Accelerated selection of a viral RNA polymerase variant during gene copy number amplification promotes rapid evolution of vaccinia virus', ['Kelsey R. Cone', 'Zev N. Kronenberg', 'Mark Yandell', 'Nels C. Elde'], u'August 1, 2016.', u'Viruses are under relentless selective pressure from host immune defenses. To study how poxviruses adapt to innate immune detection pathways, we performed serial infections of vaccinia virus in primary human cells. Independent courses of experimental evolution with a recombinant strain lacking E3L revealed several high frequency point mutations in conserved poxvirus genes, suggesting important roles for essential poxvirus proteins in innate immune subversion. Two distinct mutations were identified in the viral RNA polymerase gene A24R, which seem to act through different mechanisms to increase virus replication. Specifically, a Leu18Phe substitution in A24R conferred fitness tradeoffs, including increased activation of the antiviral factor Protein kinase R (PKR). Intriguingly, this A24R variant underwent a drastic selective sweep during passaging, despite enhanced PKR activity. We show that the sweep of this variant can be accelerated by the presence of copy number variation (CNV) at the K3L locus, which with multiple copies strongly reduces PKR activation. Therefore, adaptive cases of CNV can also facilitate the accumulation of point mutations separate from the expanded locus. This study reveals how rapid bouts of gene copy number amplification during accrual of distant point mutations can potently facilitate poxvirus adaptation to host defenses.', u'/content/early/2016/07/29/066845', [u'Evolutionary Biology'], [u'University of Utah']]
