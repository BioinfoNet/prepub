[u'Challenges in identifying and interpreting organizational modules in morphology', ['Borja Esteve-Altava'], u'January 1, 2017.', u'Form is a rich concept that agglutinates information about the proportions and topological arrangement of body parts. Modularity is readily observable in both the variation of proportions (variational modules) and the organization of topology (organizational modules). The study of variational modularity and of organizational modularity faces similar challenges regarding the identification of meaningful modules and the validation of generative processes; however, most studies in morphology focus solely on variational modularity, while organizational modularity is much less understood. A possible cause for this bias is the successful development in the last twenty years of morphometrics, and specially geometric morphometrics, to study patters of variation. This contrasts with the lack of a similar mathematical framework to deal with patterns of organization. Recently, a new mathematical framework has been proposed to study the organization of anatomical parts using tools from Network Theory, so-called anatomical network analysis. This essay explores the potential use of this new framework and the challenges it faces in identifying and validating biologically meaningful modules in morphological systems, by providing an example of a complete analysis of modularity of the human skull and upper limb. Finally, we suggest further directions of research that may bridge the gap between variational and organizational modularity studies.', u'/content/early/2017/01/01/097261', [u'Zoology'], [u'Royal Veterinary College']]
[u'Complex interactions in legume/cereal intercropping system : role of root exudates in root-to-root communication', ['Yinshan Jiao', 'Entao Wang', 'Wenfeng Chen', 'Donald L. Smith'], u'January 1, 2017.', u'Legume/cereal intercropping systems have been regarded as the practical application of basic ecological principles such as diversity, competition and facilitation. In a recent PNAS paper, Li et al. describe the novel finding that maize exudates promote faba bean nodulation and nitrogen fixation by upregulating genes involved in (iso)flavonoids synthesis (chalcone flavanone isomerase) within faba bean, resulting in production of more genistein, a legume to rhizobia signal during establishment of the faba bean N2 fixing symbiosis. Although we salute the authors methodological efforts, there is another mechanism that could be responsible for the effect of corn root exudates on faba been nitrogen fixation observed in this article. The authors may misunderstood their data and the signalling role of maize exudates, thus got a defective model for the root interactions between faba bean and maize.', u'/content/early/2017/01/01/097584', [u'Plant Biology'], [u'China Agricultural University;', u'Instituto Politecnico Nacional;', u'McGill University']]
[u'Neural precursors of decisions that matter--an ERP study of deliberate and arbitrary choice', ['Uri Maoz', 'Gideon Yaffe', 'Christof Koch', 'Liad Mudrik'], u'January 1, 2017.', u"The onset of the readiness potential (RP)--a key neural correlate of upcoming action--was repeatedly found to precede subjects' reports of having decided. This was famously taken as evidence against a causal role for consciousness in human decisions making and thus as an attack on free-will. Yet those studies focused on purposeless, unreasoned, arbitrary decisions, bereft of consequences. So, it remains unknown to what degree these neural precursors of action generalize to deliberate decisions, which are arguably more interesting, ecological, and relevant to real life. We therefore directly compared the neural correlates of deliberate and arbitrary decisions during a $1000-donation task to non-profit organizations. While we found the expected RPs for arbitrary decisions, they were strikingly absent for deliberate ones. Our results are congruent with the RP representing the accumulation of noisy, random fluctuations, which drive arbitrary--but not deliberate--decisions. In that they challenge the generalizability of studies that argue for no causal role for consciousness in decision making from arbitrary to deliberate decisions.", u'/content/early/2017/01/01/097626', [u'Neuroscience'], [u'UCLA;', u'Yale;', u'Allen Institute for Brain Science;', u'Tel Aviv University']]
[u'Theoretical principles of multiscale spatiotemporal control of neuronal networks: a complex systems perspective', ['Nima Dehghani'], u'January 1, 2017.', u'Success in the fine control of the nervous system depends on a deeper understanding of how neural circuits control behavior. There is, however, a wide gap between the components of neural circuits and behavior. We advance the idea that a suitable approach for narrowing this gap has to be based on a multiscale information-theoretic description of the system. We evaluate the possibility that brain-wide complex neural computations can be dissected into a hierarchy of computational motifs that rely on smaller circuit modules interacting at multiple scales. In doing so, we draw attention to the importance of formalizing the goals of stimulation in terms of neural computations so that the possible implementations are matched in scale to the underlying circuit modules.', u'/content/early/2017/01/01/097618', [u'Neuroscience'], [u'Massachusetts Institute of Technology']]
[u'TMEM230 is not a gene for Parkinson disease', ['Matthew J Farrer', 'Austen J Milnerwood', 'Jordan Follett', 'Ilaria Guella'], u'January 1, 2017.', u'TMEM230 mutations have been reported as a pathogenic cause of familial parkinsonism. However, we demonstrate TMEM230 p.Arg141Leu is an erroneous assignment due to incorrect genotyping. Pathogenicity is dubious given the frequency of substitutions at this non-conserved codon, and the inconsistency in genotype-phenotype correlations among families. While TMEM230 mutations are claimed to impair synaptic vesicle trafficking, the experiments are inappropriately described and inadequately controlled. In the largest family, with autosomal dominant, clinically typical and Lewy body-confirmed Parkinson disease, we previously reported a disease-segregating DNAJC13 p.Asn855Ser mutation for which genetic support remains ostensibly greater. Here we demonstrate profound deficits in endosomal tubulation and/or endosomal proliferation in mature neuronal cultures from heterozygous and homozygous DNAJC13 p.Asn855Ser knock in mice.', u'/content/early/2017/01/01/097030', [u'Genetics'], [u'University of British Columbia']]
