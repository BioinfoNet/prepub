[u'P53 is not necessary for DUX4 pathology', ['Darko Bosnakovski', 'Erik A. Toso', 'Olivia O. Recht', 'Anja Cucak', 'Abhinav K. Jain', 'Michelle C. Barton', 'Michael Kyba'], u'March 19, 2017.', u'FSHD is a genetically dominant myopathy caused by mutations that cause expression of the normally silent DUX4 gene.  This transcription factor has been shown to interfere with myogenesis when misexpressed at very low levels in myoblasts, and to cause cell death when overexpressed at high levels.  A previous report using adeno-associated virus to deliver high levels of DUX4 to mouse skeletal muscle demonstrated severe pathology that was suppressed on a p53 knockout background, implying that DUX4 acted through the p53 pathway.  Here, we investigate the p53-dependence of DUX4 using both in vitro cellular and the transgenic iDUX4(2.7) mouse models.  We find that inhibiting p53 has no effect on the cytoxicity of DUX4 in vitro.  When crossed onto the p53 null background, we find no suppression of the male-specific lethality or skin phenotypes of the DUX4 transgene, and find that primary myoblasts from this mouse are still killed by DUX4 expression.  These data challenge the notion that the p53 pathway is central to the pathogenicity of DUX4.', u'/content/early/2017/03/19/118315', [u'Genetics'], [u'University of Minnesota;', u'MD Anderson Cancer Center']]
[u'Resveratrol Induces Mitochondrial Dysfunction And Decreases Chronological Life Span Of Saccharomyces cerevisiae In A Glucose-Dependent Manner', ['Minerva Ramos-Gomez', 'Ivanna Karina Olivares-Marin', 'Melina Canizal-Garcia', 'Juan Carlos Gonzalez-Hernandez', 'Gerardo M. Nava', 'Luis Alberto Madrigal-Perez'], u'March 19, 2017.', u'A broad range of health benefits have been attributed to resveratrol (RSV) supplementation in mammalian systems, including the increases in longevity. Nonetheless, despite the growing number of studies performed with RSV, the molecular mechanism by which it acts still remains unknown. Recently, it has been proposed that inhibition of the oxidative phosphorylation activity is the principal mechanism of RSV action. This mechanism suggests that RSV might induce mitochondrial dysfunction resulting in oxidative damage to cells with a concomitant decrease of cell viability and cellular life span. To prove this hypothesis, the chronological life span (CLS) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae  was studied as it is accepted as an important model of oxidative damage and aging. In addition, oxygen consumption, mitochondrial membrane potential, and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) release were measured in order to determine the extent of mitochondrial dysfunction. The results demonstrated that the supplementation of S. cerevisiae cultures with 100 \u03bcM RSV decreased CLS in a glucose-dependent manner. At high-level glucose, RSV supplementation increased oxygen consumption during the exponential phase yeast cultures, but inhibited it in chronologically aged yeast cultures. However, at low-level glucose, oxygen consumption was inhibited in yeast cultures in the exponential phase as well as in chronologically aged cultures. Furthermore, RSV supplementation promoted the polarization of the mitochondrial membrane in both cultures. Finally, RSV decreased the release of H2O2 with high-level glucose and increased it at low-level glucose. Altogether, this data supports the hypothesis that RSV supplementation decreases CLS as a result of mitochondrial dysfunction and this phenotype occurs in a glucose-dependent manner.', u'/content/early/2017/03/19/118307', [u'Biochemistry'], [u'Universidad Autonoma de Queretaro;', u'Instituto Tecnologico Superior de Ciudad Hidalgo;', u'Instituto Tecnologico de Morelia;', u'Instituo Tecnologico Superior de Ciudad Hidalgo']]
[u'The role of glycaemic and lipid risk factors in mediating the effect of BMI on coronary heart disease: A two-step, two-sample Mendelian randomization study', ['Lin XU', 'Maria Carolina Borges', 'Gibran Hemani', 'Deborah A Lawlor'], u'March 19, 2017.', u'Background: The extent to which effects of BMI on coronary heart disease (CHD) are mediated by gylcaemic and lipid risk factors is unclear.  Methods: We used two-sample Mendelian randomization to determine the causal effect of: (i) BMI on CHD (60,801 cases; 123, 504 controls), type 2 diabetes (T2DM; 34,840 cases; 114,981 controls), fasting glucose (n=46,186), insulin (n=38,238), HbA1c (n=46,368), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides (n=188,577); (ii) glycaemic and lipids traits on CHD; and (iii) extent to which these traits mediated any effect of BMI on CHD.  Findings: One standard deviation (SD) increase in BMI (~ 4.5kg/m2) increased CHD (odds ratio=1.45 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.27, 1.66)) and T2DM (1.96 (1.35, 2.83)), and levels of fasting glucose (0.07mmol/l (95%CI 0.03, 0.11)), HbA1c (0.05% (95%CI 0.01, 0.08)), fasting insulin (0.18log pmol/l (95%CI 0.14, 0.22)) and triglycerides (0.20 SD (95%CI 0.14, 0.26)), and lowered levels of HDL-C (-0.23 SD (95%CI -0.32, -0.15)). BMI was not causally related to LDL-C. After accounting for potential pleiotropy, triglycerides, HbA1c and T2DM were causally related to CHD. The BMI-CHD effect reduced from 1.45 to 1.16 (95%CI 0.99, 1.36) and to 1.36 (95%CI 1.19, 1.57) with genetic adjustment for triglycerides or HbA1c respectively, and to 1.09 (95%CI 0.94, 1.27) with adjustment for both.  Interpretation: Increased triglyceride levels and poor glycaemic control appear to mediate much of the effect of BMI on CHD.', u'/content/early/2017/03/19/118133', [u'Epidemiology'], [u'Sun Yat-sen University;', u'University of Bristol']]
[u'Sex-associated autosomal DNA methylation differences are wide-spread and stable throughout childhood', ['Matthew Suderman', 'Andrew Simpkin', 'Gemma C Sharp', 'Tom Gaunt', 'Oliver Lyttleton', 'Wendy McArdle', 'Susan Ring', 'George Davey Smith', 'Caroline L Relton'], u'March 19, 2017.', u'Background: Almost all species show sexual discordance in many traits and diseases. DNA methylation is known to contribute to these differences through well-established\nmechanisms including X-inactivation in females, imprinting and parent-of-origin effects.Sex hormones also appear to influence sexual discordance by interacting directly with the DNA methylation pathways. However, many of the population studies reporting differences in DNA methylation patterns between sexes do so as a secondary observation. More importantly, there is little agreement about the extent or strength of the discordances, or whether they change over the life course or in response to exposures.  Methods: In a sample of 700 individuals from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, we used multi-level regression models to identify methylation differences between sexes at birth, childhood and late adolescence, and to identify changes in these differences over time. CpG sites on the sex chromosomes were excluded, along with CpGs in autosomal regions homologous with sex chromosomal regions or near common SNPs.  Results: We show that autosomal sex-discordant methylation is widespread, affecting approximately 12,000 CpG sites at each time point, and stable; at least 8,500 sites are consistently different across all time points.  Just over 1,000 methylation differences change from birth to late adolescence, 90% of these between birth and around age seven. Sexually discordant CpG sites are enriched in genomic loci containing androgen but not estrogen targets and in genes involved in tissue development but not\nhousekeeping functions. There are large overlaps with sex-discordant loci in both fetal and adult brain cortex. Variance at these sites tends to be greater in males than in females. A methylation-derived sex score capturing the variance was calculated at each time point and found to be highly correlated between time points, with higher correlation in females than in males. This score is nominally associated with sex hormone levels in childhood as well as some phenotypes previously linked to sex hormone levels.  Conclusions: These findings suggest that sex- discordant autosomal DNA methylation is widespread throughout the genome, likely due to the first androgen exposures in utero. It is then stably maintained from birth to late adolescence despite dramatically increased sexual dimorphism in the levels of the very same hormones. Methylation variation at sex-discordant sites within the sexes, as summarized by the methylation sex score, likely reflects in utero androgen exposure which is relevant to human health.', u'/content/early/2017/03/19/118265', [u'Epidemiology'], [u'University of Bristol']]
