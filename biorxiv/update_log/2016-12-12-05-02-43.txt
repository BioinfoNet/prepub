[u'Deploying dengue-suppressing Wolbachia: robust models predict slow but effective spatial spread in Aedes aegypti', ['Michael Turelli', 'Nicholas Barton'], u'December 11, 2016.', u'A novel strategy for controlling the spread of arboviral diseases such as dengue, Zika and chikungunya is to transform mosquito populations with virus-suppressing Wolbachia. In general, Wolbachia transinfected into mosquitoes induce fitness costs through lower viability or fecundity. These maternally inherited bacteria also produce a frequency-dependent advantage for infected females by inducing cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), which kills the embryos produced by uninfected females mated to infected males. These competing effects, a frequency-dependent advantage and frequency-independent costs, produce bistable Wolbachia frequency dynamics. Above a threshold frequency, denoted p\u0302 , CI drives fitness-decreasing Wolbachia transinfections through local populations; but below p\u0302, infection frequencies tend to decline to zero. If p\u0302  is not too high, CI also drives spatial spread once infections become established over sufficiently large areas. We illustrate how simple models provide testable predictions concerning the spatial and temporal dynamics of Wolbachia introductions, focusing on rate of spatial spread, the shape of spreading waves, and the conditions for initiating spread from local introductions. First, we describe data from Aedes aegypti populations near Cairns, Australia that demonstrate long-distance dispersal and provide an approximate lower bound on p\u0302  for wMel in northeastern Australia. Second, we use approximations for p\u0302 and dispersal distances to predict the outcome of 2013 releases of wMel-infected Aedes aegypti in Cairns, Australia, using idealized diffusion models of temporal and spatial dynamics. Third, we consider the robustness of diffusion-based predictions to incorporating two important features of wMel-Aedes aegypti biology that may be inconsistent with the diffusion approximations, namely fast local dynamics induced by complete CI (i.e., all embryos produced from incompatible crosses die) and long-tailed, non-Gaussian dispersal. With complete CI, long-tailed dispersal changes wave-width predictions only slightly; but it can significantly reduce wave speed relative to the diffusion prediction; it also allows smaller local introductions to initiate spatial spread. Finally, we apply our analyses to produce operational guidelines for efficient transformation of vector populations over large areas. We demonstrate that even very slow spatial spread, on the order of 10-20 m/month (as predicted), can produce area-wide population transformation within a few years following initial releases covering about 20-30% of the target area.', u'/content/early/2016/12/11/093229', [u'Zoology'], [u'University of California;', u'Institute of Science and Technology, Austria']]

[u'RL mechanisms of short-term plasticity of auditory cortex', ['Elena Krugliakova', 'Alexey Gorin', 'Anna Shestakova', 'Tommaso Fedele', 'Vasily Klucharev'], u'December 11, 2016.', u'The decision-making process is exposed to modulatory factors, and, according to the expected value (EV) concept the two most influential factors are magnitude of prospective behavioural outcome and probability of receiving this outcome. The discrepancy between received and predicted outcomes is reflected by the reward prediction error (RPE), which is believed to play a crucial role in learning in dynamic environment. Feedback related negativity (FRN), a frontocentral negative component registered in EEG during feedback presentation, has been suggested as a neural signature of RPE. In modern neurobiological models of decision-making the primary sensory input is assumed to be constant over the time and independent of the evaluation of the option associated to it. In this study we investigated whether the electrophysiological changes in auditory cues perception is modulated by the strengths of reinforcement signal, represented in the EEG as FRN. \nWe quantified the changes in sensory processing through a classical passive oddball paradigm before and after performance a neuroeconomic monetary incentive delay (MID) task. Outcome magnitude and probability were encoded in the physical characteristics of auditory incentive cues. We evaluated the association between individual biomarkers of reinforcement signal (FRN) and the degree of perceptual learning, reflected by changes in auditory ERP components (mismatch negativity and P3a). We observed a significant correlation of MMN and valence - dFRN, reflecting differential processing of gains and omission of gains. Changes in P3a were correlated to probability - dFRN, including information on salience of the outcome, in addition to its valence. \nMID task performance evokes plastic changes associated with more fine-grained discrimination of auditory anticipatory cues and enhanced involuntary attention switch towards these cues. Observed signatures of neuro-plasticity of the auditory cortex may play an important role in learning and decision-making processes through facilitation of perceptual discrimination of valuable external stimuli. Thus, the sensory processing of options and the evaluation of options are not independent as implicitly assumed by the modern neuroeconomics models of decision-making.', u'/content/early/2016/12/11/093138', [u'Neuroscience'], [u'Centre for Cognition and Decision Making, National Research University Higher School of Economics;', u'Neurosurgery Department, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland']]
[u'Using social media to quantify spatial and temporal dynamics of wildlife tourism activities', ['Francesca Mancini', 'George M Coghill', 'David Lusseau'], u'December 11, 2016.', u'1.\tWildlife tourism is a profitable industry that can affect the conservation status of targeted populations. Tourist behaviour plays a key role in the success of sustainable management strategies. Traditionally, visitor numbers are obtained through surveys, which are expensive and limited in coverage and resolution. Recently, data from social media have been used to quantify visitation. However, we do not know at which scale the use of this proxy is appropriate, especially outside protected areas. Here, we validated for the first time the use of a dataset obtained from the photo-sharing website Flickr as a proxy for wildlife tourism in Scotland.\n2.\tWe used photos uploaded on Flickr to estimate visitation in the Cairngorms National Park (CNP) and compared this dataset to a time series of visitor numbers obtained from the CNP authority. Then, we compared the spatial distribution of photographs of birds, seals, whales and dolphins taken in Scotland and uploaded on Flickr to a dataset obtained from a 2014-15 Scotland-wide wildlife tourism survey. \n3.\tWavelet analysis showed that the two time series are significantly correlated and synchronised. The results of the spatial validation showed that both the presence and the number of pictures uploaded on Flickr are correlated to survey data at different scales. Finally, kernel density maps of the wildlife pictures revealed spatio-temporal trends in wildlife watching hotspots that confirmed the validity of this dataset.\n4.\tBoth temporal and spatial trends in the distribution of pictures uploaded on Flickr displayed similar patterns to those observed in datasets obtained using traditional methods. This was true for different spatial scales and for locations inside and outside protected areas. Therefore, this method allowed us to quantify visitation even in areas that are not monitored. In conclusion, despite limitations and challenges, data from social media offer great potential to study wildlife tourism at different spatial and temporal scales.', u'/content/early/2016/12/11/093112', [u'Ecology'], [u'University of Aberdeen']]

However, this work (conducted in New Zealand and Canada) tested only low doses of kairomone. Our US study here was conducted to assess the attractiveness of higher doses of the six apple volatiles putatively identified from apple trees infested by tortricid larvae to the leafroller, Pandemis pyrusana Kearfott. These volatiles included: \u03b2-caryophyllene, germacrene D, benzyl alcohol, phenylacetonitrile, (E)-nerolidol, and indole. No volatiles were attractive to P. pyrusana when used alone. However, traps baited with phenylacetonitrile plus acetic acid caught both sexes of P. pyrusana. Traps baited with the other volatiles plus acetic acid caught zero to only incidental numbers of moths (< 1.0). Interestingly, traps baited with phenylacetonitrile plus acetic acid caught significantly more P. pyrusana than traps baited with a commercial sex pheromone lure. The evaporation rate of the acetic acid co-lure was an important factor affecting catches of P. pyrusana with phenylacetonitrile, and studies are needed to optimize the emission rates of both lure components. Further studies are warranted to develop phenylacetonitrile and possibly other aromatic plant volatiles as bisexual lures for the range of tortricid pests attacking horticultural crops.', u'/content/early/2016/12/11/092452', [u'Ecology'], [u'Plant and Food Research']]

The ability to detect ancient natural selection in the human genome could provide insights into the molecular basis for these human-specific traits. Here, we introduce a method for detecting ancient selective sweeps by scanning for extended genomic regions where our closest extinct relatives, Neandertals and Denisovans, fall outside of the present-day human variation. Regions that are unusually long indicate the presence of lineages that reached fixation in the human population faster than expected under neutral evolution. Using simulations we show that the method is able to detect ancient events of positive selection and that it can differentiate those from background selection. Applying our method to the 1000 genomes dataset, we find evidence for ancient selective sweeps favoring regulatory changes in the brain and present a list of genomic regions that are predicted to underlie positively selected human specific traits.', u'/content/early/2016/12/11/092999', [u'Genetics'], [u'Departement of Evolutionary Genetics, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology']]
[u'Fitness landscapes reveal simple strategies for steering evolution to minimize antibiotic resistance', ['Maria Smith', 'Sarah Cobey'], u'December 11, 2016.', u"The evolution of antibiotic resistance presents a practical and theoretical challenge: the design of strategies that limit the risk of evolved resistance while effectively treating current patients. Sequentially cycling antibiotics has been proposed as a way to slow the evolution of resistance by reducing the extent of adaptation to a given drug, and clinical trials have demonstrated its effectiveness in some settings. Empirical fitness landscapes in theory allow the sequence of drugs to be refined to maximize tradeoffs between drugs and thereby slow adaptation even further. Using the measured growth rates of 16 genotypes of Escherichia coli in the presence of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, we test an adaptive strategy, based on a Markov chain transition matrix, to select drug sequences that continuously minimize resistance. Cycling is never selected over the long term. Instead, monotherapy with the antibiotic that permits the least growth in its landscape's absorbing state is rapidly selected from different starting conditions. Analysis of a synthetic fitness landscape shows that cycling drugs that induce sensitivity to one other could, in theory, outperform monotherapy. These results underscore the importance of considering the specific topologies of fitness landscape in determining whether to cycle drugs and suggest a general computational approach to identify high performing, practical strategies to manage resistance.", u'/content/early/2016/12/11/093153', [u'Evolutionary Biology'], [u'University of Chicago']]

[u'Conserved Non-exonic Elements: A Novel Class of Marker for Phylogenomics', ['Scott V. Edwards', 'Alison Cloutier', 'Allan J. Baker'], u'December 11, 2016.', u'Noncoding markers have a particular appeal as tools for phylogenomic analysis because, at least in vertebrates, they appear less subject to strong variation in GC content among lineages.  Thus far, ultraconserved elements (UCEs) and introns have been the most widely used noncoding markers.  Here we analyze and study the evolutionary properties of a new type of noncoding marker, conserved non-exonic elements (CNEEs), which consists of noncoding elements that are estimated to evolve slower than the neutral rate across a set of species.  Although they often include UCEs, CNEEs are distinct from UCEs because they are not ultraconserved, and, most importantly, the core region alone is analyzed, rather than both the core and its flanking regions.  Using a data set of 16 birds plus an alligator outgroup, and ~3600 - ~3800 loci per marker type, we found that although CNEEs were less variable than UCEs or introns and in some cases exhibited a slower approach to branch resolution as determined by phylogenomic subsampling, the quality of CNEE alignments was superior to those of the other markers, with fewer gaps and missing species.  Phylogenetic resolution using coalescent approaches was comparable among the three marker types, with most nodes being fully and congruently resolved.  Comparison of phylogenetic results across the three marker types indicated that one branch, the sister group to the passerine+falcon clade, was resolved differently and with moderate (> 70%) bootstrap support between CNEEs and UCEs or introns.  Overall, CNEEs appear to be promising as phylogenomic markers, yielding phylogenetic resolution as high as for UCEs and introns but with fewer gaps, less ambiguity in alignments and with patterns of nucleotide substitution more consistent with the assumptions of commonly used methods of phylogenetic analysis.', u'/content/early/2016/12/11/093070', [u'Evolutionary Biology'], [u'Harvard University;', u'Royal Ontario Museum']]
[u'Transcriptional signatures of connectomic subregions of the human striatum', ['Linden Parkes', 'Ben Fulcher', 'Murat Yucel', 'Alex Fornito'], u'December 11, 2016.', u"Functionally distinct regions of the brain are thought to possess a characteristic connectional fingerprint - a profile of incoming and outgoing connections that defines the function of that area. This observation has motivated efforts to subdivide cortical and subcortical areas using their patterns of connectivity. However, it remains unclear whether these connectomically-defined subregions of the brain can be distinguished at the molecular level. Here, we combine high-resolution diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging with comprehensive transcriptomic data to show that connectomically-defined subregions of the striatum carry distinct transcriptional signatures. Using data-driven clustering of diffusion tractography, seeded from the striatum, in 100 healthy individuals, we identify a tripartite organization of the caudate and putamen that comprises ventral, dorsal, and caudal subregions. We then use microarray data of gene expression levels in 19 343 genes, taken from 98 tissue samples distributed throughout the striatum, to accurately discriminate the three connectomically-defined subregions with 80-90% classification accuracy using linear support vector machines. This classification accuracy was robust at the group and individual level. Genes contributing strongly to the classification were enriched for gene ontology categories including dopamine signaling, glutamate secretion, response to amphetamine, and metabolic pathways, and were implicated in risk for disorders such as schizophrenia, autism, and Parkinson's disease.

[u'The computations underlying human confidence reports are probabilistic, but not Bayesian', ['William T Adler', 'Wei Ji Ma'], u'December 11, 2016.', u'Humans can meaningfully rate their confidence in a perceptual or cognitive decision. It is widely believed that these reports reflect the estimated probability that the decision is correct, but, upon closer look, this belief is a hypothesis rather than an established fact. In a pair of perceptual categorization tasks, we tested whether explicit confidence reports reflect the Bayesian posterior probability of being correct. This Bayesian hypothesis predicts that subjects take sensory uncertainty into account in a specific way in the computation of confidence ratings. We find that confidence reports are probabilistic: subjects take sensory uncertainty into account on a trial-to-trial basis. However, they do not do so in the way predicted by the Bayesian hypothesis. Instead, heuristic probabilistic models provide the best fit to human confidence ratings. This conclusion is robust to changes in the uncertainty manipulation, task, response modality, additional flexibility in the Bayesian model, and model comparison metric. To better understand the origins of the heuristic computation, we trained feedforward neural networks consisting of generic units with error feedback, mapped the output of the trained networks to confidence ratings, and fitted our behavioral models to the resulting synthetic datasets. We find that the synthetic confidence ratings are also best fit by heuristic probabilistic models.

This benefit is mediated by co-alleviation of toxic and physiologic stress. Prolonged exposure leads to further adaptation by \u2032group selection\u2032 of bacterial communities with higher detox per bacterium.
