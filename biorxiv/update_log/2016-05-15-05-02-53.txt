[u'VERSE: a versatile and efficient RNA-Seq read counting tool', ['Qin Zhu', 'Stephen A Fisher', 'Jamie Shallcross', 'Junhyong Kim'], u'May 14, 2016.', u'Motivation: RNA-Seq is a powerful technology that delivers digital gene expression data. To measure expression strength at the gene level, one popular approach is direct read counting after aligning the reads to a reference genome/transcriptome. HTSeq is one of the most popular ways of counting reads, yet its slow running speed of poses a bottleneck to many RNA-Seq pipelines. Gene level counting programs also lack a robust scheme for quantifying reads that map to non-exonic genomic features, such as intronic and intergenic regions, even though these reads are prevalent in most RNA-Seq data. \nResults: In this paper we present VERSE, an RNA-Seq read counting tool which builds upon the speed of featureCounts and implements the counting modes of HTSeq. VERSE is more than 30x faster than HTSeq when computing the same gene counts. VERSE also supports a hierarchical assignment scheme, which allows reads to be assigned uniquely and sequentially to different types of features according to user-defined priorities.', u'/content/early/2016/05/14/053306', [u'Bioinformatics'], [u'University of Pennsylvania']]
[u'Range overlap drives chromosome inversion fixation in passerine birds', ['Daniel M Hooper'], u'May 14, 2016.', u'Chromosome inversions evolve frequently but the reasons why remain largely enigmatic. I used cytological descriptions of 410 species of passerine birds (order Passeriformes) to identify pericentric inversion differences between species. Using a new fossil-calibrated phylogeny I examine the phylogenetic, demographic, and genomic context in which these inversions have evolved. The number of inversion differences between closely related species was highly variable yet consistently predicted by a single factor: whether the ranges of species overlapped. This observation holds even when the analysis is restricted to sympatric sister pairs known to hybridize, and which have divergence times estimated similar to allopatric pairs. Inversions were significantly more likely to have fixed on a sex chromosome than an autosome yet variable mutagenic input alone (by chromosome size, map length, GC content, or repeat density) cannot explain the differences between chromosomes in the number of inversions fixed. Together, these results support a model in which inversions in passerines are adaptive and spread by selection when gene flow occurs before reproductive isolation is complete.', u'/content/early/2016/05/14/053371', [u'Evolutionary Biology'], [u'University of Chicago']]
[u'Higher classification sensitivity of short metagenomic reads with CLARK-S', ['Rachid Ounit', 'Stefano Lonardi'], u'May 14, 2016.', u'The growing number of metagenomic studies in medicine and environmental sciences is creating increasing demands on the computational infrastructure designed to analyze these very large datasets. Often, the construction of ultra-fast and precise taxonomic classifiers can compromise on their sensitivity (i.e., the number of reads correctly classified). Here we introduce CLARK-S, a new software tool that can classify short reads with high precision, high sensitivity and high speed at the same time.', u'/content/early/2016/05/14/053462', [u'Bioinformatics'], [u'University of California, Riverside;', u'University of California']]

Hofmockel', 'Brian Gelder', 'Adina Howe'], u'May 14, 2016.', u'A database of curated genomes is needed to better assess soil microbial communities and their processes associated with differing land management and environmental impacts. Interpreting soil metagenomic datasets with existing sequence databases is challenging because these datasets are biased towards medical and biotechnology research and can result in misleading annotations. We have curated a database of 922 genomes of soil-associated organisms (888 bacteria and 34 archaea).  Using this database, we evaluated phyla and functions that are enriched in soils as well as those that may be underrepresented in RefSoil.  Our comparison of RefSoil to soil amplicon datasets allowed us to identify targets that if cultured or sequenced would significantly increase the biodiversity represented within RefSoil. To demonstrate the opportunities to access these underrepresented targets, we employed single cell genomics in a pilot experiment to sequence 14 genomes. This effort demonstrates the value of RefSoil in the guidance of future research efforts and the capability of single cell genomics as a practical means to fill the existing genomic data gaps.', u'/content/early/2016/05/14/053397', [u'Ecology'], [u'Iowa State University;', u'Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences;', u'University of British Columbia;', u'Michigan State University;', u'Iowa State University, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory']]
[u'Redundancy, feedback, and robustness in the Arabidopsis thaliana BZR/BEH gene family', ['Jennifer Lachowiec', 'G. Alex Mason', 'Karla Schultz', 'Christine Queitsch'], u'May 14, 2016.', u'Organismal development is remarkably robust, tolerating stochastic errors to produce consistent, so-called canalized adult phenotypes. The mechanistic underpinnings of developmental robustness are poorly understood, but recent studies implicate certain features of genetic networks such as functional redundancy, connectivity, and feedback. Here, we examine the BRZ/BEH gene family, whose function is crucial for embryonic stem development in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, to test current assumptions on functional redundancy and trait robustness. Our analyses of BRZ/BEH gene mutants and mutant combinations revealed that functional redundancy among gene family members does not contribute to trait robustness. Connectivity is another commonly cited determinant of robustness; however, we found no correlation between connectivity among gene family members or their connectivity with other transcription factors and effects on robustness. Instead, we found that only BEH4, the most ancient family member, modulated developmental robustness. We present evidence that regulatory cross-talk among gene family members is integrated by BEH4 and promotes wild-type levels of developmental robustness. Further, the chaperone HSP90, a known determinant of developmental robustness, appears to act via BEH4 in maintaining robustness of embryonic stem length. In summary, we demonstrate that even among closely related transcription factors, trait robustness can arise through the activity of a single gene family member, challenging common assumptions about the molecular underpinnings of robustness.', u'/content/early/2016/05/14/053447', [u'Genetics'], [u'University of Michigan, United States;', u'University of Washington, United States;', u'Colorado State University, United States']]
[u'Fractional Dosing of Yellow Fever Vaccine to Extend Supply: A Modeling Study', ['Joseph T. Wu', 'Corey M. Peak', 'Gabriel M. Leung', 'Marc Lipsitch'], u'May 14, 2016.', u'Background\nThe ongoing yellow fever (YF) epidemic in Angola is placing strain on the global vaccine supply. In order to extend vaccine supply and reduce the cost of mass-vaccination, dose sparing by fractional-dose vaccination has received heightened consideration. Five-fold fractionation is similar to the standard dose in safety and immunogenicity. However, no YF vaccine efficacy trials have been performed in humans, so it is possible that fractional-dose vaccines may be less efficacious even if equally immunogenic. There is an urgent need to study under what conditions fractional dosing could provide epidemiologic benefits in reducing transmission.\n\nMethods\nWe estimated the effective reproductive number for YF in Angola using disease natural history and case report data. Using these results and simple mathematical models of YF transmission, we calculated the expected final size of an epidemic under varying levels of vaccine coverage with standard-dose vaccine and up to five-fold fractionation with varying efficacy. We consider three allocation scenarios: random; targeted at only susceptible individuals; and whereby children receive standard-dose vaccines while adults receive fractional-dose vaccines.\n\nFindings\nThe effective reproductive number early in the outbreak ranged from approximately 5 to 12 transmission events per infectious individual. As expected, if five-fold fractional-doses retain 100% efficacy, the final epidemic is dramatically reduced, especially if standard-dose vaccine coverage is near 20%. If instead some fractional-dose recipients do not become immunized, the five-fold fractional-dose strategy is always beneficial, as long as this dose produces immunity in at least 20% of recipients. We quantify how the threshold becomes more stringent if vaccine action is leaky.\n\n\nInterpretation\nWe conclude that dose fractionation could be a very effective strategy for improving coverage of YF vaccines and reducing infection attack rate in populations, possibly by a large absolute and relative margin, if high to moderate efficacy is maintained by reduced-dose formulations.', u'/content/early/2016/05/14/053421', [u'Epidemiology'], [u'University of Hong Kong;', u'Harvard T.H.

[u'Improved assembly of noisy long reads by k-mer validation', ['A. Bernardo Carvalho', 'Eduardo G Dupim', 'Gabriel Nassar'], u'May 14, 2016.', u'Genome assembly depends critically on read length. Two recent technologies, PacBio and Oxford Nanopore, produce read lengths above 20 kb, which yield genome assemblies that are vastly superior to those based on Sanger or short-reads. However, the very high error rates of both technologies (around 15%-20%) makes assembly computationally expensive and imprecise at repeats longer than the read length. Here we show that the efficiency and quality of the assembly of these noisy reads can be significantly improved at a minimal cost, by leveraging on the low error rate and low cost of Illumina short reads. Namely, k-mers from the PacBio raw reads that are not present in the Illumina reads (which account for ~95% of the distinct k-mers) are deemed as sequencing errors and ignored at the seed alignment step. By focusing on ~5% of the k-mers which are error-free, read overlap sensitivity is dramatically increased. Equally important, the validation procedure can be extended to exclude repetitive k-mers, which avoids read miscorrection at repeats and further improve the resulting assemblies. We tested the k-mer validation procedure in one long-read technology (PacBio) and one assembler (MHAP/ Celera Assembler), but is likely to yield analogous improvements with alternative long-read technologies and overlappers, such as Oxford Nanopore and BLASR/DAligner.', u'/content/early/2016/05/14/053256', [u'Genomics'], [u'Universidade Federal do Ro de Janeiro']]
