Bethlehem', 'Daniel Geschwind', 'Simon Baron-Cohen'], u'December 12, 2016.', u'Abstract\nImportance: The genetic relationship between cognition, autism, and schizophrenia is complex. It is unclear how genes that contribute to cognition also contribute to risk for autism and schizophrenia.\nObjective: To investigate the interaction between genes related to cognition (measured via proxy through educational attainment, which we call edu genes) and genes/biological pathways that are atypical in autism and schizophrenia. \nDesign: Genetic correlation and enrichment analysis were conducted to identify the interaction between edu genes and risk genes and biological pathways for autism or schizophrenia. \nResults: First, edu genes are enriched in a specific developmental co-expression module that is also enriched for high confidence autism risk genes. Second, modules enriched for genes that are dysregulated in autism and schizophrenia are also enriched for edu genes. Finally, genes that overlap between the two above modules and educational attainment are significantly enriched for genes that flank human accelerated regions, suggesting increased positive selection for the overlapping gene sets. \nConclusion: Our results identify distinct co-expression modules where risk genes for the two psychiatric conditions interact with edu genes. This suggests specific pathways that contribute to both cognitive deficits and cognitive talents, in individuals with schizophrenia or autism.', u'/content/early/2016/12/12/093575', [], [u'University of Cambridge;', u'UCLA']]
[u'Correcting Chimeric Crosstalk in Single Cell RNA-seq Experiments', ['Atray Dixit'], u'December 12, 2016.', u'As part of the process of preparing scRNA-seq libraries, a diverse template is typically amplified by PCR. During amplification, spurious chimeric molecules can be formed between molecules originating in different cells. While several computational and experimental strategies have been suggested to mitigate the impact of chimeric molecules, they have not been addressed in the context of scRNA-seq experiments. We demonstrate that chimeras become increasingly problematic as samples are sequenced deeply and propose two computational solutions. The first is unsupervised and relies only on cell barcode and UMI information. The second is a supervised approach built on labeled data and a set of molecule specific features. The classifier can accurately identify most of the contaminating molecules in a deeply sequenced species mixing scRNA-seq dataset.

Copy number variations (CNVs) in the autosomal chromosomes are not known to have specific balancing mechanists but cancer cells can thrive with large dosage imbalances. Since the effect of CNVs on the cellular proteome of tumours is poorly understood, we analyzed recently generated proteogenomic data-sets on 282 patient samples of solid tumours, and investigated the implication of CNVs in the proteome of these cells. We found that the impact of CNVs is post-transcriptionally attenuated in 23-33% of the proteins with a strong enrichment for protein complex subunits. Interaction partners have a high co-regulation of their abundances and some complex subunits act as rate-limiting steps of complex assembly, indirectly controlling the abundance of other complex members. We identified 48 such regulatory interactions providing insight into assembly pathways of protein complexes involved in relevant biological processes in cancer. Lastly, we found that a gene-signature of the proteome attenuation is associated with increased resistance to chaperone and proteasome inhibitors. This study presents novel insights into the widespread importance of post-transcriptional mechanisms in cancer that allow cells to cope with their altered genomic profile.', u'/content/early/2016/12/12/093369', [u'Genomics'], [u'EMBL-EBI;', u'RWTH Aachen University;', u'European Bioinformatics Institute']]

The C. elegans homolog of Plk4,ZYG-1, is required for centriole duplication, but our understanding of how ZYG-1 levels are regulated remains incomplete. We have identified the two PP1 orthologs, GSP-1 and GSP-2, and their regulators I-2SZY-2 and SDS-22 as key regulators of ZYG-1 protein levels. We find that down-regulation of PP1 activity either directly, or by mutation of szy-2 or sds-22 can rescue the loss of centriole duplication associated with a zyg-1 hypomorphic allele. Suppression is achieved through an increase in ZYG-1 levels, and our data indicate that PP1 normally regulates ZYG-1 through a post-translational mechanism. While moderate inhibition of PP1 activity can restore centriole duplication to a zyg-1 mutant, strong inhibition of PP1 in a wild-type background leads to centriole amplification via the production of more than one daughter centriole. Our results thus define a new pathway that limits the number of daughter centrioles produced each cycle.', u'/content/early/2016/12/12/093492', [u'Cell Biology'], [u'The College of New Jersey;', u'NIDDK, NIH;', u'TCNJ;', u'Genentech Inc']]
[u'Stochastic Model for Direction Changes of Swimming Bacteria', ['Guido Fier', 'David Hansmann', 'Ruben Carlos Buceta'], u'December 12, 2016.', u'In this work we introduce a stochastic model to describe directional changes in the movement of swimming bacteria. We use the probability density function (PDF) of turn angles, measured on tumbling E. coli wild-type, to build a Langevin equation for the deflection of the bacterial body swimming in isotropic media. We solved analytically this equation by means of the Green function method and show that three parameters are sufficient to describe the movement: a characteristic time, the steady-state solution and a control parameter. We conclude that the tumble motion, which is manifested as abrupt turns, is primarily caused by the rotational boost generated by the flagellar motor and complementarily by the rotational diffusion introduced by noise. We show that, in the tumble motion, the deflection is a non-stationary stochastic processes during times where the tumble occurs. By tuning the control parameter our model is able to explain small turns of the bacteria around their centers of mass along the run. We show that the deflection during the run is an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, which for typical run times is stationary. We conclude that, along the run, the rotational boosts do not exist or are neglectable and that only the rotational diffusion remains. Thus we have a single model to explain the turns of the bacterium during the run or tumble movements, through a control parameter that can be tuned through a critical value that can explain the transition between the two turn behaviours. This model is also able to explain very satisfactory all available statistical experimental data, such as PDFs and average values of turning angles and times, of both run and tumble motions.', u'/content/early/2016/12/12/093435', [u'Biophysics'], [u'Instituto de Investigaciones Fisicas de Mar del Plata, UNMdP and CONICET;', u'Departamento de Fisica, FCEyN, Universidad Nacional de Mar del Plata']]

CTCF and cohesin control domain location by folding domains into loop structures, which are thought to be highly stable. Combining genomic, biochemical and single-molecule imaging approaches, we show that although CTCF and cohesin can physically interact, CTCF binds chromatin much more dynamically than cohesin (~1 min vs. ~22 min residence time). Moreover, after unbinding, CTCF quickly rebinds another cognate site unlike cohesin (~1 min vs. ~33 min). Thus, CTCF and cohesin form a rapidly exchanging "dynamic complex" rather than a typical stable complex. Since CTCF and cohesin are required for loop domain formation, our results suggest that chromatin loops constantly break and reform throughout the cell cycle.', u'/content/early/2016/12/12/093476', [u'Biophysics'], [u'UC Berkeley/HHMI;', u'UC Berkeley']]

Such FG-domains consist of repeating units of FxFG, FG, or GLFG sequences, which can be interspersed with highly charged amino acid sequences. Despite the high density of charge exhibited in certain FG-domains, if and how charge influences FG-domain self-assembly and selective binding of nuclear transport receptors is largely unexplored. Studying how individual charged amino acids contribute to nuclear pore selectivity is challenging with modern in vivo and in vitro techniques due to the complexity of nucleoporin sequences. Here, we present a rationally designed approach to deconstruct essential components of nucleoporins down to 14 amino acid sequences. With these nucleoporin-based peptides, we systematically dissect how charge type and placement of charge influences self-assembly and selective binding of FG-containing gels. Specifically, we find that charge type determines which hydrophobic substrates FG sequences recognize while spatial localization of charge tunes hydrophobic self-assembly and receptor selectivity of FG sequences.', u'/content/early/2016/12/12/090159', [u'Biophysics'], [u'Massachusetts Institute of Technology']]
[u'Detecting telomere elongation in longitudinal datasets: Analysis of a proposal by Simons, Stulp and Nakagawa', ['Daniel Nettle', 'Melissa Bateson'], u'December 12, 2016.', u'Telomere shortening has emerged as an important biomarker of aging. Longitudinal studies consistently find that, although telomere length shortens over time on average, there is a subset of individuals for whom telomere length is observed to increase. This apparent lengthening could either be a genuine biological phenomenon, or simply due to measurement and sampling error. Simons, Stulp and Nakagawa [Biogerontology 15: 99-103, 2014] recently proposed a statistical test for detecting when the amount of apparent lengthening in a dataset exceeds that which should be expected due to error, and thus indicating that genuine elongation may be operative in some individuals. The test is however based on a restrictive assumption, namely that each individuals true rate of telomere change is constant over time. This assumption is unrealistic, since stress and life events are thought to affect telomere dynamics, and such events occur episodically. Here we show, using simulated data that realistically mirrors empirically-observed telomere parameters, that when the assumption of a constant true rate for each individual does not hold, the test fails to detect true lengthening in a wide range of cases where it does exist. The test also suffers low power under empirically plausible magnitudes of measurement error and likely lengths of follow-up, even when the constant-rate assumption is true. Thus, whilst a significant result of the proposed test is likely to indicate that true lengthening is present in a data set, a non-significant result does not mean that true lengthening is absent.', u'/content/early/2016/12/12/093344', [u'Epidemiology'], [u'Newcastle University']]

Therefore, inovations in research of modern microbiology developed the photodynamic inactivation that is non-toxic and do not promote microbian resistance since it has multiples action sites.

To identify pathways regulating neuronal Gq signaling we performed a forward genetic screen in Caenorhabditis elegans for suppressors of activated Gq. One of the suppressors is an allele of sek-1, which encodes a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK) in the p38 MAPK pathway. Here we show that sek-1 mutants have a slow locomotion rate and that sek-1 acts in acetylcholine neurons to regulate both locomotion and Gq signaling. Furthermore, we find that sek-1 acts in mature neurons to regulate locomotion. Using genetic and behavioral approaches we demonstrate that other components of the p38 MAPK pathway also play a positive role in regulating locomotion and Gq signaling. Finally, we find that mutants in the sek-1 p38 MAPK pathway partially suppress an activated mutant of the sodium leak channel NCA-1/NALCN, a downstream target of Gq signaling.
