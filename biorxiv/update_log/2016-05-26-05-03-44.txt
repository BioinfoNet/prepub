[u'Inferring time-derivatives, including cell growth rates, using Gaussian processes', ['Peter Swain', 'Keiran Stevenson', 'Allen Leary', 'Luis F Montano-Gutierrez', 'Ivan BN Clark', 'Jackie Vogel', 'Teuta Pilizota'], u'May 25, 2016.', u"Often the time-derivative of a measured variable is of as much interest as the variable itself. For a growing population of biological cells, for example, the population's growth rate is typically more important than its size. Here we introduce a non-parametric method to infer first and second time-derivatives as a function of time from time-series data. Our approach is based on established properties of Gaussian processes and therefore applies to a wide range of data.  In tests, the method is at least as accurate as others, but has several advantages: it estimates errors both in the inference and in any summary statistics, such as lag times, allows interpolation with the corresponding error estimation, and can be applied to any number of experimental replicates. As illustrations, we infer growth rate from measurements of the optical density of populations of microbial cells and estimate the rate of in vitro assembly of an amyloid fibril and both the speed and acceleration of two separating spindle pole bodies in a single yeast cell. Being accessible through both a GUI and from scripts, our algorithm should have broad application across the sciences.", u'/content/early/2016/05/25/055483', [], [u'University of Edinburgh;', u'McGill University']]

We investigated the evolution of twelve myosin II isoforms across mammals to identify any adapted to increasing body mass. \u03b2-myosin head domain had the greatest rate of sequence divergence (0.05% per Myr) and it was the only domain where sequence divergence correlated with body mass (0.091% divergence per log mass unit). \u03b2-myosin is abundant in cardiac ventricle and slow skeletal muscle. Our analysis suggests that during evolution, \u03b2-myosin sequences have adapted to enable slower heart beating and contraction of slow skeletal muscle as body mass increased. Additionally, for eight of the twelve myosins, the ratio of divergence in the heads:tails was significantly different. For \u03b2-myosin the ratio was 3:1 while for the extraocluar, non-muscle A and embryonic myosin the ratio was <1:2.

Distinguishing between minor and major changes required robust analysis based on replica analysis and a label-swapping procedure.

Challenges in early stage diagnosis may be due to the genetic complexity of HCC. Gene fusion plays a critical function in tumorigenesis and cancer progression in multiple cancers, yet the identities of fusion genes as potential diagnostic markers in HCC have not been investigated.Paired-end RNA sequencing was performed on noncancerous and cancerous lesions in two representative HBV-HCC patients. Potential fusion genes were identified by STAR-Fusion in STAR software and validated by four publicly available RNA-seq datasets. Fourteen pairs of frozen HBV-related HCC samples and adjacent non-tumor liver tissues were examined by RT-PCR analysis for gene fusion expression.We identified 2,354 different gene fusions in the two HBV-HCC patients. Validation analysis against the four RNA-seq datasets revealed only 1.8% (43/2,354) as recurrent fusions that were supported by public datasets. Comparison with four fusion databases demonstrated that three (HLA-DPB2-HLA-DRB1, CDH23-HLA-DPB1, and C15orf57-CBX3) out of 43 recurrent gene fusions were annotated as disease-related fusion events. Nineteen were novel recurrent fusions not previously annotated to diseases, including DCUN1D3-GSG1L and SERPINA5-SERPINA9.

[u'Specialization of a polyphenism switch gene following serial duplications in Pristionchus nematodes', ['Erik J Ragsdale', 'Nicholas A Ivers'], u'May 25, 2016.', u'Polyphenism is an extreme manifestation of developmental plasticity, requiring distinct developmental programs and the addition of a switch mechanism. Because the genetic basis of polyphenism switches has only begun to be understood, how their mechanisms arise is unclear. In the nematode Pristionchus pacificus, which has a mouthpart polyphenism specialized for alternative diets, a gene (eud-1) executing the polyphenism switch was recently identified as the product of lineage-specific duplications. Here we infer the role of gene duplications in producing a switch gene. Using reverse genetics and population genetic analyses, we examine evidence for competing scenarios of degeneration and complementation, neutral evolution, and functional specialization. Of the daughter genes, eud-1 alone has assumed switch-like regulation of the mouth polyphenism. Measurements of life-history traits in single, double, and triple sulfatase mutants did not, given modest sample sizes and a benign environment, identify alternative or complementary roles for eud-1 paralogs. Although possible roles are still unknown, selection analyses of the sister species and 104 natural isolates of P. pacificus detected purifying selection on the genes, suggesting their functionality by their fixation and evolutionary maintenance. Our approach shows the tractability of reverse genetics in a non-traditional model system to study evolution by gene duplication.', u'/content/early/2016/05/25/055384', [u'Evolutionary Biology'], [u'Indiana University']]
[u'Transitive inference in humans and rhesus macaques after massed training of the last two list items', ['Greg Jensen', 'Yelda Alkan', 'Fabian Munoz', 'Vincent P Ferrera', 'Herbert S Terrace'], u'May 25, 2016.', u'Transitive inference (TI) is a classic learning paradigm for which the relative contributions of experienced rewards and representation-driven inference have been vigorously debated, particularly with regard to the notion that animals are capable of logic and reasoning. Rhesus macaque subjects and human participants performed a TI task in which, prior to learning a seven-item list ABCDEFG, a block of trials presented exclusively the pair FG. Contrary to the expectation of associative models, the high prior rate of reward for F did not disrupt learning of the entire list. Monkeys (who each completed many sessions) learned to anticipate that novel stimuli should be preferred over F. We interpret this as evidence of a general task representation of TI that generalizes beyond learning about specific stimuli. Humans (who were task-na\xefve) showed a transitory bias to F when it was paired with novel stimuli, but very rapidly unlearned that bias. Performance with respect to the remaining stimuli was consistent with past reports of TI in both species. These results are difficult to reconcile with any account that seeks to assign the strength of association between individual stimuli and rewards. Instead, they support both sophisticated cognitive processes in both species, albeit with some species differences.', u'/content/early/2016/05/25/055335', [u'Animal Behavior and Cognition'], [u'Columbia University']]
