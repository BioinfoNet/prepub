[u'Resource Competition Shapes the Response of Genetic Circuits', ['Yili Qian', 'Hsin-Ho Huang', 'Jose Jimenez', 'Domitilla Del Vecchio'], u'December 3, 2016.', u"A common approach to design genetic circuits is to compose gene expression cassettes together. While appealing, this modular approach is challenged by the fact that expression of each gene depends on the availability of transcriptional/translational resources, which is in turn determined by the presence of other genes in the circuit. This raises the question of how competition for resources by different genes affects a circuit's behavior. Here, we create a library of genetic activation cascades, where we explicitly tune the resource demand by each gene. We develop a general Hill-function-based model that incorporates resource competition effects through resource demand coefficients. These coefficients lead to non-regulatory interactions among genes that reshape circuit's behavior. For the activation cascade, such interactions result in surprising biphasic or monotonically decreasing responses. Finally, we use resource demand coefficients to guide the choice of RBS and DNA copy number to restore the cascade's intended monotonically increasing response. Our results demonstrate how unintended circuit's behavior arises from resource competition and provide a model-guided methodology to minimize the resulting effects.", u'/content/early/2016/12/03/091306', [u'Synthetic Biology'], [u'Massachusetts Institute of Technology;', u'University of Surrey']]
[u'Compositional Inductive Biases in Function Learning', ['Eric Schulz', 'Joshua B Tenenbaum', 'David Duvenaud', 'Maarten Speekenbrink', 'Samuel J Gershman'], u'December 3, 2016.', u'How do people recognize and learn about complex functional structure? Taking inspiration from other areas of cognitive science, we propose that this is achieved by harnessing compositionality: complex structure is decomposed into simpler building blocks. We formalize this idea within the framework of Bayesian regression using a grammar over Gaussian process kernels, and compare this approach with other structure learning approaches. Participants consistently chose compositional (over non-compositional) extrapolations and interpolations of functions. Experiments designed to elicit priors over functional patterns revealed an inductive bias for compositional structure. Compositional functions were perceived as subjectively more predictable than non-compositional functions, and exhibited other signatures of predictability, such as enhanced memorability and reduced numerosity. Taken together, these results support the view that the human intuitive theory of functions is inherently compositional.', u'/content/early/2016/12/03/091298', [u'Animal Behavior and Cognition'], [u'University College London;', u'Massachusetts Institute of Technology;', u'University of Toronto;', u'Harvard University']]

In this article, we document the software and demonstrate its use in studies of shape variation in healthy and diseased humans. The number of different shape measures and the size of the populations make this the largest and most detailed shape analysis of human brains every conducted. Brain image morphometry shows great potential for providing much-needed biological markers for diagnosing, tracking, and predicting progression of mental health disorders. Very few software algorithms provide more than measures of volume and cortical thickness, and more subtle shape measures may provide more sensitive and specific biomarkers. Mindboggle computes a variety of (primarily surface-based) shapes: area, volume, thickness, curvature, depth, Laplace-Beltrami spectra, Zernike moments, etc. We evaluate Mindboggle's algorithms using the largest set of manually labeled, publicly available brain images in the world and compare them against state-of-the-art algorithms where they exist.

[u'Monolayer-crystal streptavidin support films provide an internal standard of cryo-EM image quality', ['Bong-Gyoon Han', 'Zoe L Watson', 'Jamie H D Cate', 'Robert M Glaeser'], u'December 3, 2016.', u'Analysis of images of biotinylated Escherichia coli 70S ribosome particles, bound to streptavidin affinity grids, demonstrates that the image-quality of particles can be predicted by the image-quality of the monolayer crystalline support film. The quality of the Thon rings is also a good predictor of the image-quality of particles, but only when images of the streptavidin crystals extend to relatively high resolution. When the estimated resolution of streptavidin was 5 \xc5 or worse, for example, the ribosomal density map obtained from 22,697 particles went to only 9.5 \xc5, while the resolution of the map reached 4.0 \xc5 for the same number of particles, when the estimated resolution of streptavidin crystal was 4 \xc5 or better. It thus is easy to tell which images in a data set ought to be retained for further work, based on the highest resolution seen for Bragg peaks in the computed Fourier transforms of the streptavidin component. The refined density map obtained from 57,826 particles obtained in this way extended to 3.6 \xc5, a marked improvement over the value of 3.9 \xc5 obtained previously from a subset of 52,433 particles obtained from the same initial data set of 101,213 particles after 3-D classification. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that interaction with the air-water interface can damage particles when the sample becomes too thin. Streptavidin monolayer crystals appear to provide a good indication of when that is the case.', u'/content/early/2016/12/03/091355', [u'Biophysics'], [u'Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory;', u'UC Berkeley']]

[u'How Cancer Genomics Drives Cancer Biology: Does Synthetic Lethality Explain Mutually Exclusive Oncogenic Mutations?', ['Harold Varmus', 'Arun M Unni', 'William W Lockwood'], u'December 3, 2016.', u'Large-scale analyses of cancer genomes are revealing patterns of mutations that suggest biologically significant ideas about many aspects of cancer, including carcinogenesis, classification, and preventive and therapeutic strategies. Among those patterns is \u2033mutual exclusivity\u2033, a phenomenon observed when two or more mutations that are commonly observed in samples of a type of cancer are not found combined in individual tumors. We have been studying a striking example of mutual exclusivity: the absence of co-existing mutations in the KRAS and EGFR proto-oncogenes in human lung adenocarcinomas, despite the high individual frequencies of such mutations in this common type of cancer. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that toxic effects of the joint expression of KRAS and EGFR mutant oncogenes, rather than loss of any selective advantages conferred by a second oncogene that operates through the same signaling pathway, are responsible for the observed mutational pattern. We discuss the potential for understanding the physiological basis of such toxicity, for exploiting it therapeutically, and for extending the studies to other examples of mutual exclusivity.', u'/content/early/2016/12/03/091173', [u'Cancer Biology'], [u'Weill Cornell Medicine;', u'BC Cancer Agency and University of British Columbia']]
[u'Bacterial genome reduction as a result of short read sequence assembly', ['Charles H.D. Williamson', 'Andrew Sanchez', 'Adam Vazquez', 'Joshua Gutman', 'Jason W Sahl'], u'December 3, 2016.', u'High-throughput comparative genomics has changed our view of bacterial evolution and relatedness. Many genomic comparisons, especially those regarding the accessory genome that is variably conserved across strains in a species, are performed using assembled genomes. For completed genomes, an assumption is made that the entire genome was incorporated into the genome assembly, while for draft assemblies, often constructed from short sequence reads, an assumption is made that genome assembly is an approximation of the entire genome. To understand the potential effects of short read assemblies on the estimation of the complete genome, we downloaded all completed bacterial genomes from GenBank, simulated short reads, assembled the simulated short reads and compared the resulting assembly to the completed assembly. Although most simulated assemblies demonstrated little reduction, others were reduced by as much as 25%, which was correlated with the repeat structure of the genome. A comparative analysis of lost coding region sequences demonstrated that up to 48 CDSs or up to ~112,000 bases of coding region sequence, were missing from some draft assemblies compared to their finished counterparts. Although this effect was observed to some extent in 32% of genomes, only minimal effects were observed on pan-genome statistics when using simulated draft genome assemblies. The benefits and limitations of using draft genome assemblies should be fully realized before interpreting data from assembly-based comparative analyses.', u'/content/early/2016/12/03/091314', [u'Genomics'], [u'Northern Arizona University']]
