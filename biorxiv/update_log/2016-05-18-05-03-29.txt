Richard McCombie', 'Christopher M. Hammell'], u'May 17, 2016.', u'One of the primary challenges in the field of psychiatric genetics is the lack of an in vivo model system in which to functionally validate candidate neuropsychiatric risk genes (NRGs) in a rapid and cost-effective manner1-3.  To overcome this obstacle, we performed a candidate-based RNAi screen in which C. elegans orthologs of human NRGs were assayed for dendritic arborization and cell specification defects using C. elegans PVD neurons.  Of 66 NRGs, identified via exome sequencing of autism (ASD)4 or schizophrenia (SCZ)5-9 probands and whose mutations are de novo and predicted to result in a complete or partial loss of protein function, the C. elegans orthologs of 7 NRGs were found to be required for proper neuronal development and represent a variety of functional classes, including transcriptional regulators and chromatin remodelers, molecular chaperones, and cytoskeleton-related proteins.  Notably, the positive hit rate, when selectively assaying C. elegans orthologs of ASD and SCZ NRGs, is enriched >14-fold as compared to unbiased RNAi screening10.  Furthermore, we find that RNAi phenotypes associated with the depletion of NRG orthologs is recapitulated in genetic mutant animals, and, via genetic interaction studies, we show that the NRG ortholog of ANK2, unc-44, is required for SAX-7/MNR-1/DMA-1 signaling.  Collectively, our studies demonstrate that C. elegans PVD neurons are a tractable model in which to discover and dissect the fundamental molecular mechanisms underlying neuropsychiatric disease pathogenesis.', u'/content/early/2016/05/17/053900', [], [u'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory;', u'Stony Brook University, Medical Scientist Training Program']]
[u'Protein complex prediction for large protein protein interaction networks with the Core&Peel Method', ['Marco Pellegrini', 'Miriam Baglioni', 'Filippo Geraci'], u'May 17, 2016.', u'Motivations.\nBiological networks play an increasingly important role in the\nexploration of  functional modularity and  cellular organization at a\nsystemic level. Quite often the first tools used to analyze these\nnetworks are  clustering algorithms. We concentrate here\non the specific task of predicting protein complexes (PC) in large protein-protein\ninteraction networks (PPIN).\nCurrently, many state-of-the-art algorithms work well for networks of small or moderate size.\nHowever, their  performance on much larger networks, which are becoming increasingly common in modern proteome-wise studies, needs to be re-assessed.\nOur aim is to push forward the state-of the-art in PPIN clustering providing an algorithmic\nsolution with polynomial running time  that attains\nexperimentally demonstrable good output quality and speed on challenging large real networks.\n\nResults.\nWe present a new fast algorithm for clustering large sparse\nnetworks:  Core&Peel, which runs essentially in time and storage\nO(a(G)m+n) for a network G of n nodes and m arcs, where\na(G) is the  arboricity of G (which is roughly\nproportional to the maximum average degree of any induced subgraph\nin G). We evaluated  Core&Peel on five PPI networks of large\nsize and one of medium size from both yeast and homo sapiens, comparing its\nperformance against those of  ten state-of-the-art methods. We\ndemonstrate  that  Core&Peel consistently outperforms the ten\ncompetitors in its ability to identify known protein complexes and\nin the functional coherence of its predictions.

Lover'], u'May 17, 2016.', u'A recent publication in The Lancet by Cordeiro and colleagues reported levels of IgM for Zika (ZIKV) and dengue (DENV) viruses in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 31 infants born with microcephaly in Brazil. [The Lancet. 2016;387(10030):1811-1812. doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(16)30253-7.] Their study suggests higher titers in CSF relative to serum in individual neonates, but no quantitative comparisons are reported. In this short report, the differences in antibody titers are quantified and compared between sample sources; across sampling periods; and between sample sources within individual neonates to more comprehensively understand these data to inform serological surveillance. These are statistically significant differences in ZIKV titers between CSF and serum samples, (in contrast to DENV titers), and these ZIKV titer levels remain elevated across sampling dates, whereas the titer in serum trends downward by sampling date. In multivariate models, ZIKV titer in CSF samples is independent of titer in serum, and of DENV antibodies in both CSF and serum. These findings quantify the compartmentalization of ZIKV antigens across the blood-brain barrier, and suggest complex interplay between ZIKV and cross-reacting DENV antigens in congenital/neonatal infections.', u'/content/early/2016/05/17/051326', [u'Epidemiology'], [u'University of California, San Francisco']]

Blobel'], u'May 17, 2016.', u'During mitosis, RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and many transcription factors dissociate from chromatin, and transcription ceases globally. Transcription is known to restart in bulk by telophase, but whether de novo transcription at the mitosis-G1 transition is in any way distinct from later in interphase remains unknown. We tracked Pol II occupancy genome-wide in mammalian cells progressing from mitosis through late G1. Unexpectedly, during the earliest rounds of transcription at the mitosis-G1 transition, ~50% of active genes and distal enhancers exhibit a spike in transcription, exceeding levels observed later in G1 phase. Enhancer-promoter chromatin contacts are depleted during mitosis and restored rapidly upon G1 entry, but do not spike. Of the chromatin-associated features examined, histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation levels at individual loci in mitosis best predict the mitosis-G1 transcriptional spike. Single-molecule RNA imaging supports that the mitosis-G1 transcriptional spike can constitute the maximum transcriptional activity per DNA copy throughout the cell division cycle. The transcriptional spike occurs heterogeneously and propagates to cell-to-cell differences in mature mRNA expression. Our results raise the possibility that passage through the mitosis-G1 transition might predispose cells to diverge in gene expression states.', u'/content/early/2016/05/17/053678', [u'Molecular Biology'], [u"The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia;", u'University of Pennsylvania;', u'Pennsylvania State University;', u'Pennsylvanian State University']]
[u'Environmental modification via a quorum sensing molecule influences the social landscape of siderophore production', ['Roman Popat', 'Freya Harrison', 'Luke McNally', 'Paul Williams', 'Stephen P Diggle'], u'May 17, 2016.', u'Bacteria produce a wide variety of exoproducts that favourably modify their environment and increase their fitness. These are often termed public goods because they are costly for individuals to produce and can be exploited by non-producers (cheats). The outcome of conflict over public goods is dependent upon the prevailing environment and the phenotype of the individuals in competition. Many bacterial species use quorum sensing (QS) signalling molecules to regulate the production of public goods. QS therefore determines the cooperative phenotype of individuals, and influences conflict over public goods. In addition to their regulatory functions, many QS molecules have additional properties that directly modify the prevailing environment. This leads to the possibility that QS molecules could influence conflict over public goods indirectly through non-signalling effects, and the impact of this on social competition has not previously been explored. The Pseudomonas aeruginosa QS signal molecule PQS is a powerful chelator of iron which can cause an iron starvation response. Here we show that PQS stimulates a concentration-dependent increase in the cooperative production of iron scavenging siderophores, resulting in an increase in the relative fitness of non-producing siderophore cheats. This is likely due to an increased cost of siderophore output by producing cells and a concurrent increase in the shared benefits, which accrue to both producers and cheats. Although PQS can be a beneficial signalling molecule for P. aeruginosa, our data suggests that it can also render a siderophore-producing population vulnerable to competition from cheating strains. More generally our results indicate that the production of one social trait can indirectly affect the costs and benefits of another social trait.', u'/content/early/2016/05/17/053918', [u'Microbiology'], [u'University of Nottingham;', u'University of Edinburgh']]

Early studies showed monovalent formalin-inactivated HRV vaccine can be protective, and virus-neutralizing antibodies (nAb) correlated with protection. However, co-circulation of many HRV types discouraged further vaccine efforts. We approached this problem straightforwardly. We tested the hypothesis that increasing virus input titers in polyvalent inactivated HRV vaccine will result in broad nAb responses. Here, we show that serum nAb against many rhinovirus types can be induced by polyvalent, inactivated HRVs plus alhydrogel (alum) adjuvant. Using formulations up to 25-valent in mice and 50-valent in rhesus macaques, HRV vaccine immunogenicity was related to sufficient quantity of input antigens, and valency was not a major factor for potency or breadth of the response.

[u'EGAD: Ultra-fast functional analysis of gene networks', ['Sara Ballouz', 'Melanie Weber', 'Paul Pavlidis', 'Jesse Gillis'], u'May 17, 2016.', u"Summary: \nEvaluating gene networks with respect to known biology is a common task but often a computationally costly one.  Many computational experiments are difficult to apply exhaustively in network analysis due to run-times. To permit high-throughput analysis of gene networks, we have implemented a set of very efficient tools to calculate functional properties in networks based on guilt-by-association methods. EGAD (Extending 'Guilt-by-Association' by Degree) allows gene networks to be evaluated with respect to hundreds or thousands of gene sets. The methods predict novel members of gene groups, assess how well a gene network groups known sets of genes, and determines the degree to which generic predictions drive performance. By allowing fast evaluations, whether of random sets or real functional ones, EGAD provides the user with an assessment of performance which can easily be used in controlled evaluations across many parameters.  \nAvailability and Implementation: The software package is freely available at https://github.com/sarbal/EGAD and implemented for use in R and Matlab.

[u'Comparing the Statistical Fate of Paralogous and Orthologous Sequences', ['Florian Massip', 'Michael Sheinman', 'Sophie Schbath', 'Peter Arndt'], u'May 17, 2016.', u'Since several decades, sequence alignment is a widely used tool in bioinformatics. For\ninstance, finding homologous sequences with known function in large databases is used to get\ninsight into the function of non-annotated genomic regions. Very efficient tools, like BLAST\nhave been developed to identify and rank possible homologous sequences. To estimate the\nsignificance of the homology, the ranking of alignment scores takes a background model for\nrandom sequences into account. Using this model one can estimate the probability to find\ntwo exactly matching subsequences by chance in two unrelated sequences. The corresponding\nprobability for two homologous sequences is much higher allowing to identify them. Here we\nfocus on the distribution of lengths of exact sequence matches in protein coding regions pairs\nof evolutionary distant genomes.

[u'Euclidean distance as a measure of ventral and dorsal white matter connectivity', ['Philipp Kellmeyer'], u'May 17, 2016.', u'Fiber tractography based on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has become an important in-vivo tool for investigating the anatomical connectivity between brain regions. Combining DTI with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) allows for the mapping of the structural and functional architecture of large-scale networks for cognitive processing. This line of research has shown that ventral and dorsal fiber pathways subserve different aspects of stimulus- and task-dependent processing in the brain.  \nHere we investigate the feasibility and usefulness of Euclidean distance (ED) as a simple geometric measure to differentiate ventral and dorsal long-range white matter fiber pathways between parietal and inferior frontal cortex in a body of studies that used probabilistic tractography. \nWe show that ventral pathways between parietal and inferior cortex, on average have a significantly longer ED in 3D-coordinate space than dorsal pathways. This finding needs to be further validated in analyzing studies that used different fiber tracking methods for detecting ventral/dorsal pathways between other brain regions. Thus, it could provide a simple measure and potentially a boundary value to assess patterns of connectivity in the large body of fMRI studies in the absence of DTI data. This would allow for a much broader assessment of general patterns of ventral and dorsal large-scale connectivity for different cognitive operations.', u'/content/early/2016/05/17/053959', [u'Neuroscience'], [u'Department of Neurosurgery, Epilepsy Center, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Germany']]
[u'Eusociality and other improbable evolutionary outcomes can be accelerated by trait hitchhiking in boom-bust feedback loops', ['William H. Calvin'], u'May 17, 2016.', u"Here I analyze the brush-fire cycle behind the brushy frontier of a grassland, seeking evolutionary feedback loops for large grazing animals and their hominin predators.  The burn scar's new grass is an empty niche for grass-specialized herbivores, which evolved from mixed feeders only in the early Pleistocene.  The frontier subpopulation of grazers that discovers the auxiliary grassland quickly multiplies, creating a secondary boom among predators.  Following this boom, a bust occurs several decades later when the brush returns; it squeezes both offshoot populations back into their core grasslands population.  For both prey and predators, such a feedback loop can shift the core's gene frequencies toward those of the brush explorers.  Any brush-relevant allele could benefit from this amplifying feedback loop, so long as its phenotypes concentrate near where empty niches can open up in the brush; with hitchhiking, improved survival is unnecessary.  Cooperative nurseries in the brush's shade should concentrate the alleles favoring eusociality, enabling their amplification.", u'/content/early/2016/05/17/053819', [u'Evolutionary Biology'], [u'University of Washington']]
[u'Model selection in statistical historical biogeography of Neotropical insects-the Exophthalmus genus complex (Curculionidae: Entiminae)', ['Guanyang Zhang', 'Usmaan Basharat', 'Nicholas Matzke', 'Nico Franz'], u'May 17, 2016.', u'Statistical historical biogeographical methods rely on the use of models that assume various biogeographic processes. Until recently model selection remains an explored topic and the impacts of using different models on inferring biogeographic history are poorly understood. Focusing on the Neotropical weevils in the Exophthalmus genus complex (Insecta: Curculionidae: Entiminae), we compare three commonly used biogeographic models - DIVA (Dispersal-Vicariance Analysis), DEC (Dispersal-Extinction-Cladogenesis) and BayArea (Bayesian Analysis of Biogeography), and examine the impact of modeling founder-event jump dispersal on biogeographic history estimation. We also investigate the biogeographic events that have shaped patterns of distributions, diversification, and endemism in this group of weevils. We sample representatives of 65 species of the Exophthalmus genus complex and 26 outgroup terminals from the Neotropics including Caribbean islands and mainland. We reconstruct a molecular phylogeny based on six genes and performed molecular dating using a relaxed clock with three fossil calibration points. We conduct biogeographic history estimations and compare alternative biogeographic models with the R package BioGeoBEARS. Model selection strongly favors biogeographic models that include founder-event jump dispersal. Without modeling jump dispersal, estimations based on the three biogeographic models are dramatically different, especially at early diverging nodes. When jump dispersal is modeled, however, the three biogeographic models perform similarly. Accordingly, we show that the Neotropical mainland was colonized by Caribbean species in the early Miocene, and that in situ diversification accounts for a majority (~75%) of the biogeographic events in the Exophthalmus genus complex. Our study highlights the need for testing for wide-ranging historical biogeographic processes in the study of Caribbean biogeography and the importance of comparing and selecting the best-fitting model in statistical biogeographic inferences. We demonstrate that modeling founder-event jump dispersal significantly improves the fit of the biogeographic history estimation of Caribbean and Neotropical mainland weevils. We establish that in situ diversification acts as a dominant biogeographic force in the evolution of the Exophthalmus genus complex. The colonization of the Neotropical mainland from Caribbean islands reinforces the notion that islands can be an important source of continental diversity.', u'/content/early/2016/05/17/053611', [u'Evolutionary Biology'], [u'Arizona State University;', u'The University of Arizona College of Medicine;', u'National University of Australia']]
