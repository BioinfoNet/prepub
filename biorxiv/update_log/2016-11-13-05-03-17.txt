[u'Interneuronal mechanisms of hippocampal theta oscillation in a full-scale model of the rodent CA1 circuit', ['Marianne Bezaire', 'Ivan Raikov', 'Kelly Burk', 'Dhrumil Vyas', 'Ivan Soltesz'], u'November 12, 2016.', u'The hippocampal theta rhythm plays important roles in information processing; however, the mechanisms of its generation are not well understood. We developed a data-driven, supercomputer-based, full-scale (1:1) model of the rodent CA1 area and studied its interneurons during theta oscillations. Theta rhythm with phase-locked gamma oscillations and phase-preferential discharges of distinct interneuronal types spontaneously emerged from the isolated CA1 circuit without rhythmic inputs. Perturbation experiments identified parvalbumin-expressing interneurons and neurogliaform cells, as well as interneuronal diversity itself, as important factors in theta generation. These simulations reveal new insights into the spatiotemporal organization of the CA1 circuit during theta oscillations.', u'/content/early/2016/11/12/087403', [u'Neuroscience'], [u'Boston University;', u'Stanford University;', u'UC Irvine']]
[u'A first-principle for the nervous system', ['Kunjumon I Vadakkan'], u'November 12, 2016.', u'Higher brain functions such as perception and memory are first-person internal sensations whose mechanisms can have options to concurrently activate motor neurons for behavioral action. By setting up all the required constraints using available information from different levels, a theoretical examination from a first-person frame of reference led to the derivation of a first-principle of the structure-function units. These units operate in synchrony with the synaptically-connected neural circuitry. These units are capable of explaining and interconnecting findings from various levels and enable triangulation of a large number of observations from both the normal and loss of function states of the system. Indirect evidence for the presence of a comparable circuitry in a remote species \u2212 Drosophila \u2212 suggests the universal presence of these units across the animal kingdom. The key features of the basic unit meet the expectations of the K-lines proposed for the development of artificial intelligence.', u'/content/early/2016/11/12/087353', [u'Neuroscience'], [u'Neurosearch Center']]
[u'Regime shifts, alternative states and hysteresis in the Sarracenia microecosystem', ['Matthew K Lau', 'Ben Baiser', 'Nicholas J Gotelli', 'Aaron M Ellison'], u'November 12, 2016.', u'Changes in environmental conditions can lead to a rapid shift in the\nstate of an ecosystem ("regime shift"), which subsequently returns to\nthe previous state slowly, if ever ("hysteresis"). Studies of\necological regime shifts have been hampered by the large spatial and\ntemporal scales over which they occur and the lack of a common\nframework linking observational and experimental data to models. The\nnaturally-occurring aquatic micro-ecosystem inside leaves of the\nnorthern pitcher plant (Sarracenia purpurea) occurs in both\noligotrophic and eutrophic states. These alternative states also can\nbe induced experimentally by enriching oligotrophic pitchers with\nadditional insect prey, which elevates oxygen demand by microbes and\nleads to rapid eutrophication. This regime shift of the\nSarracenia micro-ecosystem has been modeled with discrete-time\ndifference equations that include parameters for the photosynthetic\nrate of the pitcher plant, consequent diffusion of oxygen through the\npitcher liquid, rate of prey input, and biological oxygen demand by\nmicrobes as they decompose and mineralize the prey. We elaborated the\nregime-shift model of the Sarracenia micro-ecosystem and used\nsensitivity analysis to identify the parameters that control most\nstrongly the dynamics of the system as it switches between\noligotrophic and eutrophic states. Three main findings emerged. 1)\nSimulations accurately captured the regime shift and subsequent\nhysteresis that follows from prey enrichment; 2) When modeled as a\nmodified Hill function, the interaction of prey input and\ndecomposition rates drove the regime shift; 3) The interaction between\nbiological oxygen demand of the food web and decomposition rate\nyielded a threshold that altered the hysteresis dynamics, shifting the\nsign of the effect of increasing the oxygen demand parameter. Because\nthe model of the Sarracenia micro-ecosystem displays\nbehaviors that are qualitatively similar to larger scale models of\ndynamic systems, we suggest that the Sarracenia\nmicro-ecosystem itself represents a valuable and scalable experimental\nsystem for studying ecological regime shifts.', u'/content/early/2016/11/12/087296', [u'Ecology'], [u'Harvard University;', u'University of Florida;', u'University of Vermont']]

The evidence for a potential SV at a locus is indicated by variation in the counts of short-reads that map anomalously to the locus. These SV traits are treated as quantitative traits and mapped genetically, analogously to a gene expression study. Association between an SV trait at one locus and genotypes at a distant locus indicate the origin and target of a transposition.  Using ultra-low-coverage (0.3x) population sequence data from 488 recombinant inbred Arabidopsis genomes, we identified 6,502 segregating SVs. Remarkably, 25% of these were transpositions. Whilst many SVs cannot be delineated precisely, PCR validated 83% of 44 predicted transposition breakpoints.  We show that specific SVs may be causative for quantitative trait loci for germination, fungal disease resistance and other phenotypes. Further we show that the phenotypic heritability attributable to sequence anomalies differs from, and in the case of time to germination and bolting, exceeds that due to standard genetic variation. Gene expression within SVs is also more likely to be silenced or dysregulated. This approach is generally applicable to large populations sequenced at low-coverage, and complements the prevalent strategy of SV discovery in fewer individuals sequenced at high coverage.', u'/content/early/2016/11/12/087387', [u'Genetics'], [u'Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics;', u'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center;', u'Colby-Sawyer College;', u'University of Utah;', u'Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research;', u'University of Oxford;', u'Kew Gardens;', u'Oxford University;', u'John Innes Centre;', u'UMR INRA-Agrocampus Ouest-Universit\xe9 de Rennes;', u'The Sainsbury Laboratory;', u'EMBL-EBI;', u'University of Bath;', u'Gregor Mendel Institute of Molecular Plant Biology;', u'University College London']]
[u'Association of five SNPs with human hair colour in the Polish population', ['Anna Siewierska-Gorska', 'Aneta Sitek', 'Elzbieta Zadzinska', 'Grzegorz Bartosz', 'Dominik Strapagiel'], u'November 12, 2016.', u'Twenty-two variants of the genes involved in hair pigmentation (OCA2, HERC2, MC1R, SLC24A5, SLC45A2, TPCN2, TYR, TYRP1) were genotyped in a group of 186 Polish subjects, representing a range of hair colours (45 red, 64 blond, 77 dark). A genotype-phenotype association analysis was performed. \nUsing z-statistics and the associated p-value, we identified three variants highly associated with different hair colour categories (rs12913832:A>G in HERC2, rs1805007:T>C and rs1805008:C>T in MC1R). Two variants: rs1800401:C>T in OCA2 and rs16891982:C>G in SLC45A2 showed a high probability of a relation with hair colour, although that probability did not exceed the threshold of statistical significance after applying the Bonferroni correction. We created and validated mathematical logistic regression models in order to test the usefulness of the sets of polymorphisms for hair colour prediction in the Polish population. We subjected four models to stratified cross-validation. The first model consisted of three polymorphisms that proved to be important in the associative analysis. The second model included, apart from the mentioned polymorphisms, additionally rs16891982:C>G in SLC45A. The third model included, apart from the variants relevant in the associative analysis, rs1800401:C>T in OCA. The fourth model consisted of the set of polymorphisms from the first model supplemented with rs16891982:C>G in SLC45A and rs1800401:C>T in OCA. The validation of our models showed that the inclusion of rs16891982:C>G in SLC45A and rs1800401:C>T in OCA increases the prediction of red hair in comparison with the algorithm only including rs12913832:A>G in HERC2, rs1805007:T>C and rs1805008:C>T in MC1R. The model consisting of all the five above-mentioned genetic variants showed good prediction accuracies, expressed by the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics: 0.84 for the red-haired, 0.82 for the dark-haired and 0.71 for the blond-haired. \nA genotype-phenotype association analysis brought results similar to those in other studies and confirmed the role of rs16891982:C>G, rs12913832:A>G, rs1805007:T>C and rs1805008:C>T in hair colour determination in the Polish population. Our study demonstrated for the first time the possibility of a share of the rs1800401:C>T SNP in the OCA2 gene in hair colour determination. Including this SNP in the actual hair colour predicting models would improve their predictive accuracy.', u'/content/early/2016/11/12/087429', [u'Genetics'], [u'University of Lodz, Department of Molecular Biophysics;', u'University of Lodz, Department of Anthropology;', u'University of Lodz, Department of Molecular Biophysics, Biobank Lab']]
[u'Self-destructive altruism in a synthetic developmental program enables complex feedstock utilization', ['Robert Egbert', 'Leandra M Brettner', 'David Zong', 'Eric Klavins'], u'November 12, 2016.', u'Stochastic differentiation and programmed cell death are common developmental processes in microbes, driving diverse altruistic behaviors that promote cooperation. Utilizing cell death in developmental programs requires control over the rate of differentiation to balance cell proliferation against the utility of sacrifice. However, the regulatory networks that control these behaviors are often complex and have yet to be successfully harnessed as biotechnology. Here, we engineered a synthetic developmental gene network that couples stochastic differentiation with programmed cell death to implement a two-member division of labor. Progenitor cellobiose consumer cells were engineered to grow on cellobiose and differentiate at a controlled rate into self-destructive altruists that release an otherwise sequestered cellulase enzyme payload through autolysis to form a developmental Escherichia coli consortium that utilizes cellulose for growth. We used an experimentally parameterized model of task switching, payload delivery and cellulose conversion to nutrients to set key parameters to achieve overall population growth supported by cellulase release, liberating 14-23% of the available carbon. An inevitable consequence of engineering altruistic developmental behaviors is the emergence of cheaters that undermine cooperation. We observed cheater phenotypes for consumers and altruists, identified mutational hotspots and constructed a predictive model of circuit longeivity based on mutation rate estimates for each mode of evolutionary escape. This work introduces the altruistic developmental program as a new tool for synthetic biology, demonstrates the utility of population dynamics models to engineer complex phenotypes and provides a testbed for probing the evolutionary biology of self-destructive altruism.', u'/content/early/2016/11/12/086900', [u'Synthetic Biology'], [u'University of Washington']]
