[u'Cell proliferation depends on the direct binding between PKM2 and AKAP-Lbc', ['Xinping Chen', 'Graeme K Carnegie'], u'January 26, 2017.', u'The M2 form of the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase (PKM2) has generated much interest recently due to its important role in tumor metabolism.  A yeast two-hybrid screen carried out by the Alliance for Cell Signaling suggests that PKM2 interacts with A-Kinase Anchoring Protein (AKAP)-Lbc.  AKAP-Lbc (also known as AKAP13) is a scaffold protein that integrates signaling through multiple enzymes including protein kinases A and D and the small G protein Rho.  AKAP-Lbc was originally identified in leukemic blast cells, and multiple reports implicate AKAP-Lbc in breast, prostate and thyroid cancers, however the role of AKAP-Lbc in cancer biology is not understood.  Co-immunoprecipitation, pulldown and Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation (BiFC) data indicate that PKM2 interacts with AKAP-Lbc.  Mapping experiments indicate that PKM2 directly interacts with amino acid residues 1923-2817 of AKAP-Lbc.  By disrupting the interaction between the two proteins with the expression of the AKAP-Lbc fragments, our data suggest that the binding between PKM2 and PKA plays a critical role in cell proliferation.  The work indicates that the binding between AKAP-Lbc and PKM2 may be an important target to treat some cancers by reducing the cell proliferation.', u'/content/early/2017/01/25/103333', [u'Biochemistry'], [u'Purdue University;', u'University of Illinois at Chicago']]
