[u'HydDB: A web tool for hydrogenase classification and analysis', ['Dan Sondergaard', 'Christian N.S. Pedersen', 'Chris Greening'], u'July 4, 2016.', u"H2 metabolism is the most ancient and diverse mechanism of energy-generation. The metalloenzymes mediating this metabolism, hydrogenases, are encoded by over 60 microbial phyla and are present in all major ecosystems. We developed a classification system and web tool, HydDB, for the structural and functional analysis of these enzymes. We show that hydrogenase function can be predicted by primary sequence alone using an expanded classification scheme (comprising 29 [NiFe]-hydrogenase subgroups, 8 [FeFe]-hydrogenase subtypes, [Fe]-hydrogenases). Using this scheme, we built a web tool that rapidly and reliably classifies hydrogenase primary sequences using a combination of k-nearest neighbors' algorithms and CDD referencing. Demonstrating its capacity, the tool reliably predicted hydrogenase content and function in 12 newly-sequenced bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes.  HydDB also provides the capacity to browse 3248 annotated sequences and contains a detailed repository of physiological, biochemical, and structural information about the 38 hydrogenase classes defined here. The database and classifier are freely and publicly available at http://services.birc.au.dk/hyddb/", u'/content/early/2016/07/04/061994.1', [u'Bioinformatics'], [u'Aarhus University;', u'Monash University']]

We argue that urban plant communities assemble from a complex mix of horticultural and regional species pools and thus evaluate the homogenisation hypothesis by comparing cultivated and spontaneously occurring urban vegetation to natural area vegetation across seven major US cities. Urban yards were homogenised across cities in terms of their diversity, composition, and structure. First, cultivated and spontaneous yard flora had higher numbers of species than did natural areas but similar phylogenetic diversity, indicating that yard species were drawn from a relatively small number of lineages. Second, yards were compositionally more similar across regions than were natural areas. Finally, vegetation structure, specifically cultivated tree density, was less variable in yards than natural areas across cities. Biodiversity homogenisation likely reflects similar horticultural source pools, homeowner preferences, management practices, and environmental filters across US cities.', u'/content/early/2016/07/04/061937', [u'Ecology'], [u'McGill University;', u'University of Minnesota;', u'National Socio-Economic Sysnthesis Center;', u'Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies;', u'Indiana University;', u'City University of New York;', u'Forest Service;', u'Arizona State University;', u'Nicholas School of the Environment;', u'The Ecosystems Center;', u'University of Utah;', u'Northern Arizona University;', u'Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University;', u'University of Delaware']]
[u'Modelling the transcription factor DNA-binding affinity using genome-wide ChIP-based data', ['Monther Alhamdoosh', 'Dianhui Wang'], u'July 4, 2016.', u'Understanding protein-DNA binding affinity is still a mystery for many transcription factors (TFs). Although several approaches have been proposed in the literature to model the DNA-binding specificity of TFs, they still have some limitations. Most of the methods require a cut-off threshold in order to classify a K-mer as a binding site (BS) and finding such a threshold is usually done by handcraft rather than a science. Some other approaches use a prior knowledge on the biological context of regulatory elements in the genome along with machine learning algorithms to build classifier models for TFBSs. Noticeably, these methods deliberately select the training and testing datasets so that they are very separable. Hence, the current methods do not actually capture the TF-DNA binding relationship. In this paper, we present a threshold-free framework based on a novel ensemble learning algorithm in order to locate TFBSs in DNA sequences. Our proposed approach creates TF-specific classifier models using genome-wide DNA-binding experiments and a prior biological knowledge on DNA sequences and TF binding preferences. Systematic background filtering algorithms are utilized to remove non-functional K-mers from training and testing datasets. To reduce the complexity of classifier models, a fast feature selection algorithm is employed. Finally, the created classifier models are used to scan new DNA sequences and identify potential binding sites. The analysis results show that our proposed approach is able to identify novel binding sites in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome.', u'/content/early/2016/07/04/061978', [u'Bioinformatics'], [u'La Trobe University']]
[u'Effects of the ordering of natural selection and population regulation mechanisms on Wright-Fisher models', ['Zhangyi He', 'Mark Beaumont', 'Feng Yu'], u'July 4, 2016.', u'The Wright-Fisher model and its extensions are of central importance in population genetics, and so far, they have formed the basis of most theoretical and applied population genetic research. In the present work, we explore the effect that the ordering of natural selection and population regulation in the life cycle has on the resulting population dynamics under the Wright-Fisher model, especially for the evolution of one- and two-locus systems. With weak natural selection, the details of how to order natural selection and population regulation in the life cycle do not matter in the Wright-Fisher model and its diffusion approximation. By contrast, we show that when there is strong natural selection and the population is in linkage disequilibrium, there can be appreciable differences in the resulting population dynamics under the Wright-Fisher model, depending on whether natural selection occurs before or after population regulation in the life cycle. We argue that this effect may be of significance in natural populations subject to gene migration and local selection.', u'/content/early/2016/07/04/061911', [u'Genetics'], [u'University of Bristol, United Kingdom']]
[u'General calibration of microbial growth in microplate readers', ['Keiran Stevenson', 'Alexander F McVey', 'Ivan B N Clark', 'Peter S Swain', 'Teuta Pilizota'], u'July 4, 2016.', u'Optical density (OD) measurements of microbial growth are one of the most common techniques used in microbiology, with applications ranging from antibiotic efficacy studies, studies of growth under different nutritional or stress environments, to studies of different mutant strains, including those harbouring synthetic circuits. OD measurements are performed under the assumption that the OD value obtained is proportional to the cell number, i.e. the concentration of the sample. However, the assumption holds true in a limited range of conditions and calibration techniques that determine that range are currently missing. Here we present a set of calibration procedures and considerations that are necessary to successfully estimate the cell concentration from OD measurements.', u'/content/early/2016/07/04/061861', [u'Microbiology'], [u'University of Edinburgh']]

[u'Anisotropic Correction of Beam-induced Motion for Improved Single-particle Electron Cryo-microscopy', ['Shawn Zheng', 'Eugene Palovcak', 'Jean-Paul Armache', 'Yifan Cheng', 'David Agard'], u'July 4, 2016.', u'Correction of electron beam-induced sample motion is one of the major factors contributing to the recent resolution breakthroughs in cryo-electron microscopy. Improving the accuracy and efficiency of motion correction can lead to further resolution improvement. Based on observations that the electron beam induces doming of the thin vitreous ice layer, we developed an algorithm to correct anisotropic image motion at the single pixel level across the whole frame, suitable for both single particle and tomographic images. Iterative, patch-based motion detection is combined with spatial and temporal constraints and dose weighting. The multi-GPU accelerated program, MotionCor2, is sufficiently fast to keep up with automated data collection. The result is an exceptionally robust strategy that can work on a wide range of data sets, including those very close to focus or with very short integration times, obviating the need for particle polishing. Application significantly improves Thon ring quality and 3D reconstruction resolution.', u'/content/early/2016/07/04/061960', [u'Biophysics'], [u'University of California at San Francisco']]
[u'Hot-wiring clathrin-mediated endocytosis in human cells', ['Laura A Wood', 'Nicholas I Clarke', 'Sourav Sarkar', 'Stephen J Royle'], u'July 4, 2016.', u'Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is the major route of receptor internalization at the plasma membrane. Analysis of constitutive CME is complicated by the fact that initiation of endocytic events is unpredictable. When and where a clathrin-coated pit will form and what cargo it will contain are difficult to foresee. Here we describe a series of genetically encoded reporters that allow the initiation of CME on demand. This is achieved by inducibly tethering a clathrin "hook" to a plasma membrane "anchor". Our design incorporates temporal and spatial control of initiation using chemical and optical tools, and the cargo is defined. Since this system bypasses multiple steps in vesicle creation, we term it "hot-wiring". In this paper we use hot-wired endocytosis to define the functional interactions between clathrin and the \u03b22 subunit of the AP2 complex. However, there are numerous applications for this new technology, which we hope will be broadly useful to the field.', u'/content/early/2016/07/04/061986', [u'Cell Biology'], [u'Warwick Medical School']]
