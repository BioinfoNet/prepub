[u'Genome-wide phenotypic analysis of growth, cell morphogenesis and cell cycle events in Escherichia coli.', ['Manuel Campos', 'Genevieve S Dobihal', 'Christine Jacobs-Wagner'], u'February 27, 2017.', u'Cell size, cell growth and the cell cycle are necessarily intertwined to achieve robust bacterial replication. However, a comprehensive and integrated view of these fundamental processes is lacking. Here, we describe an image-based quantitative screen over the single-gene knockout collection of Escherichia coli, which led to the identification of many new genes involved in cell morphogenesis, population growth, nucleoid (bulk chromosome) dynamics and cell division. Functional analyses, together with high-dimensional classification, unveil new associations of morphological and cell cycle phenotypes with specific functions and pathways. Additionally, correlation analysis across ~4,000 genetic perturbations demonstrate that growth rate is not a determinant of cell size. Cell width and length are also uncorrelated, suggesting that cells do not control their size by monitoring surface area or volume; instead cells appear to regulate width and length independently. Furthermore, our analysis identifies scaling relationships between cell size and nucleoid size and between nucleoid size and the relative timings of nucleoid separation and cell division, linking cell morphogenesis to the cell cycle via the global architecture of the chromosome.', u'/content/early/2017/02/27/101832', [], [u'Yale University']]
[u'Genomic epidemiology of global Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing E. coli', ['Nicole Stoesser', 'Anna E Sheppard', 'Gisele Peirano', 'Luke W Anson', 'Louise Pankhurst', 'Robert Sebra', 'Hang TT Phan', 'Andrew Kasarskis', 'Amy J Mathers', 'Tim EA Peto', 'Patricia Bradford', 'Mary Motyl', 'Ann S Walker', 'Derrick W Crook', 'Johann Pitout'], u'February 27, 2017.', u'The dissemination of carbapenem resistance in Escherichia coli has major implications for the management of common human infections. blaKPC, encoding a transmissible carbapenemase (KPC), has historically largely been associated with Klebsiella pneumoniae, a predominant plasmid (pKpQIL), and a specific transposable element (Tn4401, ~10kb). Here we characterize the genetic features of the emergence of blaKPC in global E. coli, 2008-2013, using both long- and short-read whole genome sequencing.  Amongst 43/45 successfully sequenced blaKPC-E. coli strains, we identified high strain (n=21 sequence types, 18% of annotated genes in the core genome); plasmid (\u22659 replicon types); and blaKPC-associated, mobile genetic element (MGE) diversity (50% not within complete Tn4401 elements). We also found evidence of interspecies, regional and international plasmid spread. In several cases blaKPC was found on high copy number, small Col-like plasmids, previously associated with horizontal transmission of resistance genes in the absence of antimicrobial selection pressures.  E. coli is a common human pathogen, but also a commensal in a multiple environmental and animal reservoirs, and easily transmissible. The association of blaKPC with a range of MGEs previously linked to the successful spread of widely endemic resistance mechanisms (e.g. blaTEM, blaCTX-M) suggests that it is likely to become similarly prevalent.', u'/content/early/2017/02/27/111914', [u'Microbiology'], [u'University of Oxford;', u'Calgary Laboratory Services;', u'Icahn Institute and Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences;', u'University of Virginia;', u'AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP;', u'Merck and Co Inc;', u'University of Calgary']]
[u'Free ISG15 as a dimer generates IL-1\u03b2-producing CD8\u03b1+ dendritic cells at the site of infection', ['Anna Napolitano', 'Annemarthe G van der Veen', 'Monique Bunyan', 'Annabel Borg', 'Svend Kjaer', 'Antje Beling', 'Klaus-Peter Knobeloch', 'Eva Frickel'], u'February 27, 2017.', u'ISG15 is strongly induced after type I IFN stimulation producing a protein comprised of two ubiquitin-like domains. Intracellularly, ISG15 can be covalently linked and modify the function of target proteins (ISGylation). In addition, free unconjugated ISG15 can be released from cells. We found that ISG15 is released in the serum of Toxoplasma gondii infected mice early after infection in a type-I IFN independent manner. Once in the extracellular space, free ISG15 forms dimers and enhances the release of key cytokines involved in the immune response to the parasite: IL-12, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-1\u03b2. Its action is dependent on an actively invading and replicating live parasite. ISG15 induces an increase of IL-1\u03b2 later during infection by leading to increased IL-1\u03b2 producing CD8\u03b1+ dendritic cells at the site of infection. Here, we define for the first time the molecular determinants of active free ISG15 and link ISG15 to IL-1\u03b2 production by CD8\u03b1+ dendritic cells. Thus we define ISG15 as a novel secreted modulator of the cytokine response during Toxoplasma infection.', u'/content/early/2017/02/27/111658', [u'Immunology'], [u'The Francis Crick Institute;', u'Charite Berlin;', u'University of Freiburg']]
[u'Novel CRISPR/Cas9 gene drive constructs in Drosophila reveal insights into mechanisms of resistance allele formation and drive efficiency in genetically diverse populations', ['Jackson Champer', 'Riona Reeves', 'Suh Yeon Oh', 'Chen Liu', 'Jingxian Liu', 'Andrew G Clark', 'Philipp W Messer'], u'February 27, 2017.', u'A functioning gene drive system could fundamentally change our strategies for the control of vector-borne diseases by facilitating rapid dissemination of transgenes that prevent pathogen transmission or reduce vector capacity. CRISPR/Cas9 gene drive promises such a mechanism, which works by converting cells that are heterozygous for the drive construct into homozygotes, thereby enabling super-Mendelian inheritance. Though CRISPR gene drive activity has already been demonstrated, a key obstacle for current systems is their propensity to generate resistance alleles. In this study, we developed two CRISPR gene drive constructs based on the nanos and vasa promoters that allowed us to illuminate the different mechanisms by which resistance alleles are formed in the model organism Drosophila melanogaster. We observed resistance allele formation at high rates both prior to fertilization in the germline and post-fertilization in the embryo due to maternally deposited Cas9. Assessment of drive activity in genetically diverse backgrounds further revealed substantial differences in conversion efficiency and resistance rates. Our results demonstrate that the evolution of resistance will likely impose a severe limitation to the effectiveness of current CRISPR gene drive approaches, especially when applied to diverse natural populations.', u'/content/early/2017/02/27/112011', [u'Genetics'], [u'Cornell University']]
[u'A fluorogenic nanobody array tag for prolonged single molecule imaging in live cells', ['Rajarshi Ghosh', 'Will Draper', 'J. Matthew Franklin', 'Quanming Shi', 'Jan Liphardt'], u'February 27, 2017.', u'Prolonged single molecule imaging in live cells requires labels that do not aggregate, have high contrast, and are photo-stable. To address these requirements, we have generated arrays of modular protein domains that function as fluorophore recruitment platforms. ArrayG, a linear repeat of GFP-nanobodies, recruits free monomeric wild-type GFP, which brightens ~15-fold upon binding the array. The fluorogenic ArrayG tag effectively eliminates background fluorescence from free binders, a major impediment to high-throughput acquisition of long trajectories in recruitment based imaging strategies. The photo-stability of ArrayG and consistently low background allowed us to continuously track single integrins for as long as 105 seconds (2100 frames). Prolonged tracking of both kinesin and integrin revealed repeated state-switching events, a measurement capability that is crucial to a mechanistic understanding of complex cellular processes. We also report an orthogonal array tag, based on a DHFR-nanobody, for prolonged dual color imaging of single molecules.', u'/content/early/2017/02/27/111690', [u'Biophysics'], [u'Stanford University']]
