[u'The Protein Phosphatase 4 complex promotes the Notch 1 pathway and wg transcription', ['Eric T. Hall', 'Tirthadipa Pradhan-Sundd', 'Faaria Samnani', 'Esther M. Verheyen'], u'March 4, 2017.', u'The Wnt/Wingless (Wg) pathway controls cell fate specification, tissue differentiation and organ development across organisms. Using an in vivo RNAi screen to identify novel kinase and phosphatase regulators of the Wg pathway, we identified subunits of the serine threonine phosphatase Protein phosphatase 4 (PP4). Knockdown of the catalytic and the regulatory subunits of PP4 cause reductions in the Wg pathway targets Senseless and Distal-less. We find that PP4 regulates the Wg pathway by controlling Notch-driven wg transcription. Genetic interaction experiments identified that PP4 likely promotes Notch signaling within the nucleus of the Notch-receiving cell. Although the PP4 complex is implicated in various cellular processes, its role in the regulation of Wg and Notch pathways was previously uncharacterized. Our study identifies a novel role of PP4 in regulating Notch pathway, resulting in aberrations in Notch-mediated transcriptional regulation of the Wingless ligand. Furthermore, we show that PP4 regulates proliferation independent of its interaction with Notch.', u'/content/early/2017/03/03/113852', [u'Developmental Biology'], [u'Simon Fraser University, Canada']]
