[u'Pulse of \u03b1-2-macroglobulin and lipocalin-1 in the pregnant uterus of European polecats (Mustela putorius) at the time of implantation', ['Heli Lindeberg', 'Richard Burchmore', 'Malcolm W. Kennedy'], u'November 18, 2016.', u'Uterine secretory proteins protect the uterus and conceptuses against infection, facilitate implantation, control cellular damage resulting from implantation, and supply embryos with nutrients. The early conceptus of the European polecat (Mustela putorius) grows and develops free in the uterus until implanting at about 12 days after mating. Using a proteomics approach we found that the proteins appearing in the uterus leading up to and including the time of implantation changed dramatically with time. Several of the proteins identified have been found in pregnant uteri of other placental mammals, such as \u03b11-antitrypsin, serum albumin, lactoferrin, cathepsin L1, uteroferrin, and ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase. The broad-spectrum proteinase inhibitor \u03b12-macroglobulin rose from relatively low abundance initially to dominate the protein profile by the time of implantation. Its functions may be to limit damage caused by the release of proteinases during implantation, and to control other processes around the site of implantation. Lipocalin-1 (also known as tear lipocalin) has not previously been recorded as a uterine secretion in pregnancy, and also increased substantially in concentration. If polecat lipocalin-1 has similar biochemical properties to the human form, then it may have a combined function in transporting or scavenging lipids, and antimicrobial activities. The changes in the uterine secretory proteome of Euroepan polecats may be similar in those species of mustelid that engage in embryonic diapause, but possibly only following reactivation of the embryo.', u'/content/early/2016/11/18/088609', [u'Developmental Biology'], [u'Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke);', u'University of Glasgow']]

[u'An icosahedral virus as a fluorescent calibration standard: methods for counting protein molecules in cells by fluorescence microscopy', ['John Murray'], u'November 18, 2016.', u'The ability to replace genes coding for cellular proteins with DNA that codes for fluorescent protein- tagged versions opens the way to counting the number of molecules of each protein component of macromolecular assemblies in vivo by measuring fluorescence microscopically. Converting fluorescence to absolute numbers of molecules requires a fluorescent standard whose molecular composition is known precisely. In this report the construction, properties, and mode of using a set of fluorescence calibration standards are described. The standards are based on an icosahedral virus particle containing exactly 240 copies of one of seven different fluorescent proteins. Two applications of the fluorescent standards to counting molecules in the human parasite Toxoplasma gondii are described. Methods for improving the precision of the measurements and avoiding potential inaccuracies are emphasized.', u'/content/early/2016/11/18/088617', [u'Cell Biology'], [u'Indiana University']]
[u'Deterministic assembly processes govern seasonal and spatial variation in microbiomes across hydrologically-connected hyporheic zones', ['Emily B. Graham', 'Alex R. Crump', 'Charles T. Resch', 'Sarah Fansler', 'Evan Arntzen', 'David W. Kennedy', 'Jim K. Fredrickson', 'James C. Stegen'], u'November 18, 2016.', u'Subsurface zones of groundwater and surface water mixing (hyporheic zones) are regions of enhanced rates of biogeochemical cycling, but ecological processes influencing hyporheic microbiomes through space and time remain unknown. We sampled attached and planktonic microbiomes in the Columbia River hyporheic zone across seasonal hydrologic change within three hydrologically-connected, yet physicochemically-distinct geographic zones (inland, nearshore, river). Although microbiomes remained dissimilar through time across all zones and habitat types (attached vs. planktonic), consistent presence of certain heterotrophic taxa suggested dispersal and/or common selective pressures among all zones. We used statistical null models and co-occurrence network analysis, respectively, to demonstrate a pronounced impact of deterministic assembly on microbiomes in all data subsets and to elucidate taxa most affected by these processes. The composition of one network cluster of nearshore organisms exhibited a seasonal shift from heterotrophic to autotrophic microorganisms, and the abundance of taxa within this cluster also correlated positively with active microbial biomass and metabolism, possibly indicating that these taxa have strong influences over biogeochemical reactions within the hyporheic zone. Taken together, our research demonstrates a predominant role for deterministic assembly across highly-connected environments and provides insight into niche dynamics associated with seasonal changes in hyporheic microbiome composition and metabolism.', u'/content/early/2016/11/18/088518', [u'Ecology'], [u'Pacific Northwest National Laboratory']]
[u'A mapping tool to identify causal mutations from forward genetic screens', ['Guy Wachsman', 'Jennifer L Modliszewski', 'Manuel Valdes', 'Philip N Benfey'], u'November 18, 2016.', u'A forward genetic screen is one of the best methods for revealing the regulatory functions of genes. In plants, this technique is highly efficient since it is relatively easy to grow and screen the phenotypes of hundreds or thousands of individuals. The cost-efficiency and ease of data production afforded by next-generation sequencing techniques have created new opportunities for mapping induced mutations. The principles of genetic mapping remain the same. However, the details have changed, which allows for rapid mapping of causal mutations. Current mapping tools are often not user-friendly and complicated or require extensive preparation steps. To simplify the process of mapping new mutations, we developed a pipeline that takes next generation sequencing fastq files as input, calls on several well-established and freely available genome-analysis tools, and outputs the most likely causal DNA change(s). The pipeline has been validated in Arabidopsis and can be readily applied to other species.', u'/content/early/2016/11/18/088591', [u'Bioinformatics'], [u'Duke;', u'University of North Carolina']]
[u'Simulations of CYP51A from Aspergillus fumigatus in a model bilayer provide insights into triazole drug resistance', ['Anthony Nash', 'Johanna Rhodes'], u'November 17, 2016.', u'Azole antifungal drugs target CYP51A in Aspergillus fumigatus by binding with the active site of the protein, blocking ergosterol biosynthesis.  Resistance to azole anti-fungal drugs is now common, with a leucine to histidine amino acid substitution at position 98 the most frequent, conferring resistance to itraconazole.  In this study, we create a homology model of CYP51A using a recently published crystal structure of the paralog protein CYP51B. The derived structures, wild-type and L98H mutant, are positioned within a lipid membrane bilayer and subjected to molecular dynamics simulations in order improve the accuracy of both models. The structural analysis from our simulations suggests a decrease in active site surface from the formation of hydrogen bonds between the histidine substitution and neighbouring polar side chains, potentially preventing the binding of azole drugs. This study yields a biologically relevant structure and set dynamics of the A. fumigatus Lanosterol 14 alpha-demethylase enzyme and provides further insight into azole antifungal drug resistance.', u'/content/early/2016/11/17/088468', [u'Biochemistry'], [u'University College London;', u'Imperial College London']]
[u'Chromatin environment, transcriptional regulation, and splicing distinguish lincRNAs and mRNAs', ['Marta Mele', 'Kaia Mattioli', 'William Mallard', 'David M Shechner', 'Chiara Gerhardinger', 'John Rinn'], u'November 17, 2016.', u'While long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) and mRNAs share similar biogenesis pathways, these transcript classes differ in many regards. LincRNAs are less evolutionarily conserved, less abundant, and more tissue-specific, suggesting that their pre- and post-transcriptional regulation is different from that of mRNAs.\nHere, we perform an in-depth characterization of the features that contribute to lincRNA regulation in multiple human cell lines. We find that lincRNA promoters are depleted of transcription factor (TF) binding sites, yet enriched for some specific factors such as GATA and FOS relative to mRNA promoters. Surprisingly, we find that H3K9me3, a histone modification typically associated with transcriptional repression, is more enriched at the promoters of active lincRNA loci than at those of active mRNAs. Moreover, H3K9me3-marked lincRNA genes are more tissue-specific. The most discriminant differences between lincRNAs and mRNAs involve splicing. LincRNAs are less efficiently spliced, which cannot be explained by differences in U1 binding or the density of exonic splicing enhancers, but may be partially attributed to lower U2AF65 binding and weaker splicing-related motifs. Conversely, the stability of lincRNAs and mRNAs is similar, differing only with regard to the location of stabilizing protein binding sites. Finally, we find that certain transcriptional properties are correlated with higher evolutionary conservation in both DNA and RNA motifs, and are enriched in lincRNAs that have been functionally characterized.', u'/content/early/2016/11/17/088484', [u'Genomics'], [u'Harvard University']]
[u'Plant growth regulators ameliorate or exacerbate abiotic and biotic stress effects on Zea mays kernel weight in a genotype-specific manner', ['Lauren Stutts', 'Yishi Wang', 'Ann E Stapleton'], u'November 17, 2016.', u'Plant growth regulators have documented roles in plant responses to single stresses. In combined-stress environments, plants display novel genetic architecture for growth traits and the response to growth regulators is unclear. We investigated the role of plant growth regulators in combined-stress responses in Zea mays. Twelve maize inbreds were exposed to all combinations of the following stressors: drought, nitrogen, and density stress. Chemical treatments were utilized to alter balances of the hormones abscisic acid, gibberellic acid, and brassinosteroids. We found a significant difference between the seed weights of plants given different chemical treatments after accounting for differences in genotype and stress environments. We conclude that plant growth regulators have targets in combined-stress response pathways in Zea mays.', u'/content/early/2016/11/17/088195', [u'Plant Biology'], [u'University of North Carolina Wilmington']]

[u'A Unified Characterization of Population Structure and Relatedness', ['Bruce S. Weir', 'Jerome Goudet'], u'November 17, 2016.', u'Many population genetic activities, ranging from evolutionary studies to association mapping\nto forensic identification, rely on appropriate estimates of population structure or relatedness. All\napplications require recognition that quantities with an underlying meaning of allelic identity by\ndescent are not defined in an absolute sense, but instead are made \u201crelative to\u201d some set of alleles\nother than the target set. The early Weir and Cockerham FST estimate made explicit that the reference\nset of alleles was across independent populations. Standard kinship estimates have an implicit\nassumption that pairs of individuals in a study sample, other than the target pair, are unrelated,\nwhereas other estimates assume alleles within individuals are not identical by descent. However,\npopulations lose independence when there is migration between them, and when individuals in a\nstudy are related it is difficult to see how they can also be non-inbred. We have therefore re-cast our\ntreatments of population structure, relatedness and inbreeding to make explicit that the parameters\nof interest involve differences of probabilities of identity by descent in the target and the reference\nsets of alleles and so can be negative. We take the reference set to be for the population from which\nstudy individuals have been sampled. We provide simple moment estimates of these parameters,\nphrased in terms of allele matching within and between individuals for relatedness and inbreeding,\nor within and between populations for population structure. A multi-level hierarchy of alleles\nwithin individuals, alleles between individuals within populations, and alleles between populations\nallows a unified treatment of relatedness and population structure. Our new estimates appear to\nbe sensitive to rare or private variants, to give indications of the effects of natural selection, and to\nbe appropriate for use in association studies.', u'/content/early/2016/11/17/088385', [u'Genetics'], [u'University of Washington;', u'University of Lausanne']]
