[u'climwin: An R Toolbox for Climate Window Analysis', ['Liam D. Bailey', 'Martijn van de Pol'], u'August 14, 2016.', u'When studying the impacts of climate change, there is a tendency to select climate data from a small set of arbitrary time periods or climate windows (e.g., spring temperature). However, these arbitrary windows may not encompass the strongest periods of climatic sensitivity and may lead to erroneous biological interpretations. Therefore, there is a need to consider a wider range of climate windows to better predict the impacts of future climate change. We introduce the R package climwin that provides a number of methods to test the effect of different climate windows on a chosen response variable and compare these windows to identify potential climate signals. climwin extracts the relevant data for each possible climate window and uses this data to fit a statistical model, the structure of which is chosen by the user. Models are then compared using an information criteria approach. This allows users to determine how well each window explains variation in the response variable and compare model support between windows. climwin also contains methods to detect type I and II errors, which are often a problem with this type of exploratory analysis. This article presents the statistical framework and technical details behind the climwin package and demonstrates the applicability of the method with a number of worked examples.', u'/content/early/2016/08/14/069427', [], [u'Australian National University;', u'Australian National University; Netherlands Institute of Ecology']]
[u'Mapping eQTL by leveraging multiple tissues and DNA methylation', ['Chaitanya R Acharya', 'Kouros Owzar', 'Andrew S Allen'], u'August 14, 2016.', u"Background: DNA methylation is an important tissue-specific epigenetic event that influences transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Differentially methylated CpG sites may act as mediators between genetic variation and gene expression, and this relationship can be exploited while mapping multi-tissue expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). Current multi-tissue eQTL mapping techniques are limited to only exploiting gene expression patterns across multiple tissues either in a joint tissue or tissue-by-tissue frameworks. We present a new statistical approach that enables us to model the effect of germ-line variation on tissue-specific gene expression in the presence of effects due to DNA methylation. \n\nResults: Our method efficiently models genetic and epigenetic variation to identify genomic regions of interest containing combinations of mRNA transcripts, CpG sites, and SNPs by jointly testing for genotypic effect and higher order interaction effects between genotype, methylation and tissues. We demonstrate using Monte Carlo simulations that our approach, in the presence of both genetic and DNA methylation effects, gives an improved performance (in terms of statistical power) to detect eQTLs over the current eQTL mapping approaches. When applied to an array-based dataset from 150 neuropathologically normal adult human brains, our method identifies eQTLs that were undetected using standard tissue-by-tissue or joint tissue eQTL mapping techniques. As an example, our method identifies eQTLs in a BAX inhibiting gene (TMBIM1), which may have a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease.  \n\nConclusions: Our score test-based approach does not need parameter estimation under the alternative hypothesis. As a result, our model parameters are estimated only once for each mRNA - CpG pair. Our model specifically studies the effects of non-coding regions of DNA (in this case, CpG sites) on mapping eQTLs. However, we can easily model micro-RNAs instead of CpG sites to study the effects of post-transcriptional events in mapping eQTL. Our model's flexible framework also allows us to investigate other genomic events such as alternative gene splicing by extending our model to include gene isoform-specific data.", u'/content/early/2016/08/14/069534', [], [u'Duke University']]
[u'OncoSimulR: genetic simulation of cancer progression with arbitrary epistasis and mutator genes', ['Ramon Diaz-Uriarte'], u'August 14, 2016.', u'OncoSimulR implements forward-in-time genetic simulations of diallelic loci in asexual populations with special focus on cancer progression. Fitness can be defined as an arbitrary function of genetic interactions between multiple genes or modules of genes, including epistasis, restrictions in the order of accumulation of mutations, and order effects. Mutation rates can be made to differ between genes, and can be affected by (anti)mutator genes.

[u'Peptide partitions and protein identification: a computational analysis', ['G Sampath'], u'August 14, 2016.', u'Peptide sequences from a proteome can be partitioned into N mutually exclusive sets and used to identify their parent proteins in a sequence database. This is illustrated with the human proteome (http://www.uniprot.org; id UP000005640), which is partitioned into eight subsets KZ*R, KZ*D, KZ*E, KZ*, Z*R, Z*D, Z*E, and Z*, where Z \u03f5 {A, N, C, Q, G, H, I, L, M, F, P, S, T, W, Y, V} and Z* \u2261 0 or more occurrences of Z. If the full peptide sequence is known then over 98% of the proteins in the proteome can be identified from such sequences. The rate exceeds 78% if the positions of four internal residue types are known. When the standard set of 20 amino acids is replaced with an alphabet of size four based on residue volume the identification rate exceeds 96%. In an information-theoretic sense this last result suggests that protein sequences effectively carry nearly the same amount of information as the exon sequences in the genome that code for them using an alphabet of size four.

[u'A unifying comparative phylogenetic framework including traits coevolving across interacting lineages', ['Marc Manceau', 'Amaury Lambert', 'Helene Morlon'], u'August 14, 2016.', u'Models of phenotypic evolution fit to phylogenetic comparative data are widely used to make inferences regarding the tempo and mode of trait evolution. A wide range of models is already available for this type of analysis, and the field is still under active development. One of the most needed developments concerns models that better account for the effect of within- and between-clade interspecific interactions on trait evolution, that can result from processes as diverse as competition, predation, parasitism, or mutualism. Here, we begin by developing a very general comparative phylogenetic framework for (multi)-trait evolution that can be applied to both ultrametric and non-ultrametric trees. This framework not only encapsulates all previous classical models of univariate and multivariate phenotypic evolution, but also paves the way for the consideration of a much broader series of models in which lineages co-evolve, meaning that trait changes in one lineage are influenced by the value of traits in other, interacting lineages. Next, we provide a standard way for deriving the probabilistic distribution of traits at tip branches under our framework. We show that a multivariate normal distribution remains the expected distribution for a broad class of models accounting for interspecific interactions. Our derivations allow us to fit various models efficiently, and in particular greatly reduce the computation time needed to fit the recently proposed phenotype matching model. Finally, we illustrate the utility of our framework by developing a toy model for mutualistic coevolution. Our framework should foster a new era in the study of coevolution from comparative data.', u'/content/early/2016/08/14/069518', [], [u"Institut de biologie de l'Ecole Normale Superieure;", u'Laboratoire Probabilites et Modeles Aleatoires, UPMC Univ Paris 06;', u"Institut de Biologie de l'Ecole Normale Superieure"]]
[u'A functional analysis of the contribution of climatic niche divergence to adaptive radiation', ['Alex R Gunderson', 'D. Luke Mahler', 'Manuel Leal'], u'August 14, 2016.', u'Analyses of evolutionary radiations have traditionally focused on traits related to resource acquisition, habitat use, and mate choice. Nonetheless, incorporation of climatic niche divergence has become more common in recent years, driven by the development of correlative ecological niche models (ENMs) that allow niche characterization based solely on geo-referenced locality data. However, ENMs require no data on organismal traits that link climatic conditions to performance, and thus have little to say about how organisms phenotypically adapt to different climatic conditions, what the performance consequences of phenotypic divergence are, and how phenotypic divergence influences resource partitioning within communities of co-occurring species. Here, we conduct a functional (i.e., physiological) analysis of climatic niche divergence within Greater Antillean Anolis radiations. We find that physiological divergence occurred repeatedly within these radiations, that there are performance consequences of physiological divergence within natural habitats, and that physiological divergence facilitates species co-existence within species-rich communities. We also use phylogenetic methods to compare rates of evolution of ecologically relevant physiological and morphological traits, and find that physiology has evolved either more slowly or as fast (but not faster) than morphology. Our analysis demonstrates the benefit of a functional approach to understanding macroevolutionary patterns of climatic niche divergence.', u'/content/early/2016/08/14/069294', [], [u'San Francisco State University;', u'University of Toronto;', u'University of Missouri']]

Data on clinical utility of screening conditions beyond professional guidelines is scarce. \n\nMethods:\nIndividuals underwent ECS for up to 110 genes. 537 at-risk couples (ARC), those in which both partners carry the same recessive disease, were invited to a retrospective IRB-approved survey of their reproductive decision making after receiving ECS results.\n\nResults:\n64 eligible ARC completed the survey. Of 45 respondents screened preconceptionally, 62% (n=28) planned IVF with PGD or prenatal diagnosis (PNDx) in future pregnancies. 29% (n=13) were not planning to alter reproductive decisions. The remaining 9% (n=4) of responses were unclear. \nOf 19 pregnant respondents, 42% (n=8) elected PNDx, 11% (n=2) planned amniocentesis but miscarried, and 47% (n=9) considered the condition insufficiently severe to warrant invasive testing. Of the 8 pregnancies that underwent PNDx, 5 were unaffected and 3 were affected. 2 of 3 affected pregnancies were terminated.\nDisease severity was found to have significant association (p=0.000145) with changes in decision making, whereas guideline status of diseases, controlled for severity, was not (p=0.284).\n\nConclusion:\nMost ARC altered reproductive planning, demonstrating the clinical utility of ECS.

[u'A Systems-Level Model Reveals That 1,2-Propanediol Utilization Microcompartments Enhance Pathway Flux Through Intermediate Sequestration.', ['Christopher M Jakobson', 'Marilyn F. Slininger', 'Danielle Tullman-Ercek', 'Niall M. Mangan'], u'August 14, 2016.', u'The spatial organization of metabolism is common to all domains of life. Enteric and other bacteria use subcellular organelles known as bacterial microcompartments to spatially organize the metabolism of pathogenicity-relevant carbon sources, such as 1,2-propanediol. The organelles are thought to sequester a private cofactor pool, minimize the effects of toxic intermediates, and enhance flux through the encapsulated metabolic pathways. We develop a mathematical model of the function of the\n1,2-propanediol utilization microcompartment of Salmonella enterica and use it to analyze the function of the microcompartment organelles in detail. Our model makes accurate predictions of doubling times based on an optimized compartment shell permeability determined by maximizing metabolic flux in the model. The compartments function primarily to decouple cytosolic intermediate concentrations from the concentrations in the microcompartment, allowing significant enhancement in pathway flux by the generation of large concentration gradients across the\nmicrocompartment shell. We find that selective permeability of the microcompartment shell is not absolutely necessary, but is often beneficial in establishing this intermediate-trapping function. Our findings also implicate active transport of the\n1,2-propanediol substrate under conditions of low external substrate concentration, and we present a mathematical bound, in terms of external 1,2-proanediol substrate concentration and diffusive rates, on when active transport of the substrate is\nadvantageous. By allowing us to predict experimentally inaccessible aspects of microcompartment function, such as intra-microcompartment metabolite concentrations, our model presents avenues for future research and underscores the importance of carefully considering changes in external metabolite concentrations and other conditions during batch cultures. Our results also suggest that the encapsulation of heterologous pathways in bacterial microcompartments might yield significant benefits for pathway flux, as well as for toxicity mitigation.', u'/content/early/2016/08/14/069542', [], [u'Northwestern University;', u'University of California, Berkeley;', u'University of Washington']]
[u'How do Research Faculty in the Biosciences Evaluate Paper Authorship Criteria?', ['Timothy Kassis'], u'August 14, 2016.', u'Authorship on peer-reviewed journal articles and abstracts has become the main currency and reward unit in academia. Such a reward has become a crucial component for students and postdocs who are often under-compensated and thus value authorship as their primary reward mechanism. While numerous scientific and publishing organizations have attempted to write guidelines for defining who gets to be an author and what rank they should be listed in, there remains much ambiguity when it comes to how the various criteria are weighed by research faculty. Here we sought to quantify the relative importance of each of the 11 criteria we defined as being significant contributions for scientific authorship. We sent out an anonymous survey to approximately 564 faculty members at ten different research institutions across the United States. The faculty were from the biomedical engineering, biology, and bioengineering departments. The response rate was approximately 18% with a final sample size of 102 faculty members. We found that there was a consensus on some criteria as being crucial, such as time spent conducting experiments, but there was a lack of consensus regarding the role of obtaining funding. This study provides one of the first quantitative assessments of how faculty members in the biomedical sciences evaluated these 11 authorship criteria. We believe researchers will find this insightful and will narrow down the disparity between what they assume as being important and what faculty value. This understanding will also bring us closer to establishing a more standardized system for determining authorship and rank in the biosciences.', u'/content/early/2016/08/14/069468', [], [u'Massachusetts Institute of Technology']]

Submergence-induced hypoxia in plants results in stabilisation of group VII ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTORS (ERF-VIIs), which aid survival under the adverse conditions. ERF-VII stability is controlled by the N-end rule pathway, which proposes that ERF-VII N-terminal cysteine oxidation in normoxia enables arginylation followed by proteasomal degradation. The PLANT CYSTEINE OXIDASEs (PCOs) have been identified as catalysing this oxidation. ERF-VII stabilisation in hypoxia presumably arises from reduced PCO activity. We directly demonstrate that PCO dioxygenase activity produces Cys-sulfinic acid at the N-terminus of an ERF-VII peptide, which then undergoes efficient arginylation by an arginyl transferase (ATE1). This is the first molecular evidence showing N-terminal cysteine oxidation and arginylation by N-end rule pathway components, and the first ATE1 substrate in plants. The PCOs and ATE1 may be viable intervention targets to stabilise N-end rule substrates, including ERF-VIIs to enhance submergence tolerance in agronomy.', u'/content/early/2016/08/14/069336', [], [u'University of Oxford;', u'Leibniz Institute of Plant Biochemistry (IPB);', u'RWTH Aachen;', u'Max Planck Institute for Molecular Physiology']]

Church'], u'August 14, 2016.', u'The degeneracy of the genetic code allows nucleic acids to encode amino acid identity as well as non-coding information for gene regulation and genome maintenance. The rare arginine codons AGA and AGG (AGR) present a case study in codon choice, with AGRs encoding important transcriptional and translational properties distinct from the other synonymous alternatives (CGN). We created a strain of Escherichia coli with all 123 instances of AGR codons removed from all essential genes. We readily replaced 110 AGR codons with the synonymous CGU, but the remaining thirteen "recalcitrant" AGRs required diversification to identify viable alternatives. Successful replacement codons tended to conserve local ribosomal binding site-like motifs and local mRNA secondary structure, sometimes at the expense of amino acid identity. Based on these observations, we empirically defined metrics for a multi-dimensional "safe replacement zone" (SRZ) within which alternative codons are more likely to be viable. To further evaluate synonymous and non-synonymous alternatives to essential AGRs, we implemented a CRISPR/Cas9-based method to deplete a diversified population of a wild type allele, allowing us to exhaustively evaluate the fitness impact of all 64 codon alternatives. Using this method, we confirmed relevance of the SRZ by tracking codon fitness over time in 14 different genes, finding that codons that fall outside the SRZ are rapidly depleted from a growing population. Our unbiased and systematic strategy for identifying unpredicted design flaws in synthetic genomes and for elucidating rules governing codon choice will be crucial for designing genomes exhibiting radically altered genetic codes.', u'/content/early/2016/08/14/069385', [], [u'Harvard University;', u'Harvard University, Ecole des Mines de Paris, Mines Paristech;', u'Harvard University, University of Washington;', u'Yale University']]
