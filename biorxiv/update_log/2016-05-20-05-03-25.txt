[u'Top-down modulation of stimulus drive via beta-gamma cross-frequency interaction.', ['Craig Geoffrey Richter', 'William Hedley Thompson', 'Conrado A Bosman', 'Pascal Fries'], u'May 19, 2016.', u'Recently, several studies have demonstrated that visual stimulus routing is subserved by inter-areal gamma-band synchronization, whereas top-down influences are mediated by alpha-beta band synchronization. These processes might implement top-down control, if top-down and bottom-up mediating rhythms are coupled through cross-frequency interaction. To test this possibility, we investigated Granger-causal influences among awake macaque primary visual area V1, higher visual area V4 and parietal control area 7a during attentional task performance. Top-down 7a-to-V1 beta-band influences enhanced visually driven V1-to-V4 gamma-band influences. This enhancement was spatially specific and largest for a beta-to-gamma delay of ~100 ms, suggesting a causal relationship. We propose that this cross-frequency interaction mechanistically subserves the attentional control of stimulus selection.', u'/content/early/2016/05/19/054288', [], [u'Ernst Struengmann Institute (ESI) for Neuroscience in Cooperation with Max Planck Society;', u'Karolinska Institute;', u'University of Amsterdam']]
[u'Deriving shape-based features for C. elegans locomotion using dimensionality reduction methods', ['Bertalan Gyenes', 'Andre Brown'], u'May 19, 2016.', u'High-throughput analysis of animal behavior has become a reality with the advance of recording technology, leading to large high-dimensional data sets. This dimensionality can sometimes be reduced while still retaining relevant information. In the case of the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, more than 90% of the shape variance can be captured using just four principal components. However, it remains unclear if other methods can achieve a more compact representation or contribute further biological insight to worm locomotion. Here we take a data-driven approach to worm shape analysis using independent component analysis (ICA), non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), a cosine series, and jPCA and confirm that the dimensionality of worm shape space is close to four. Projecting worm shapes onto the bases derived using each method gives interpretable features ranging from head movements to tail oscillation. We use these as a comparison method to find differences between the wild type N2 worms and various mutants. The different bases provide complementary views of worm behavior and we expect that closer examination of the time series of projected amplitudes will lead to new results in the future.', u'/content/early/2016/05/19/054379', [], [u'Imperial College, London (GB)']]
[u'Integrative genetic and epigenetic analysis uncovers regulatory mechanisms of autoimmune disease', ['Parisa Shooshtari', 'Hailiang Huang', 'Chris Cotsapas'], u'May 19, 2016.', u'Genome-wide association studies in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases (AID) have uncovered hundreds of loci mediating risk. These associations are preferentially located in non-coding DNA regions and in particular to tissue--specific DNase I hypersensitivity sites (DHS). Whilst these analyses clearly demonstrate the overall enrichment of disease risk alleles on gene regulatory regions, they are not designed to identify individual regulatory regions mediating risk or the genes under their control, and thus uncover the specific molecular events driving disease risk. To do so we have departed from standard practice by identifying regulatory regions which replicate across samples, and connect them to the genes they control through robust re--analysis of public data. We find substantial evidence of regulatory potential in 132/301 (44%) risk loci across nine autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, and are able to prioritize a single gene in 104/132 (79%) of these. Thus, we are able to generate testable mechanistic hypotheses of the molecular changes that drive disease risk.', u'/content/early/2016/05/19/054361', [], [u'Yale School of Medicine;', u'Massachusetts General Hospital']]
[u'Systematic comparison of monoclonal versus polyclonal antibodies for mapping histone modifications by ChIP-seq', ['Michele Busby', 'Catherine Xue', 'Yossi Farjoun', 'Elizabeth Gienger', 'Ido Yofe', 'Adrianne Gladden', 'Chad Nusbaum', 'Alon Goren'], u'May 19, 2016.', u'The robustness of ChIP-seq datasets is highly dependent upon the antibodies used. Currently, polyclonal antibodies are the standard despite several limitations: they are non-renewable, vary in performance between lots, and need to be validated with each new lot. In contrast, monoclonal antibody lots are renewable and provide consistent performance. To increase ChIP-seq standardization, we investigated whether monoclonal antibodies could replace polyclonal antibodies. We compared monoclonal antibodies that target five key histone modifications (H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K9me3, H3K27ac and H3K27me3) to their polyclonal counterparts. Overall performance was highly similar for four monoclonal/polyclonal pairs. In contrast, the binding patterns for H3K27ac differed substantially between polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. However, this was most likely due to the distinct immunogen used rather than the clonality of the antibody. Altogether, we found that monoclonal antibodies as a class perform as well as polyclonal antibodies. Accordingly, we recommend the use of monoclonal antibodies in ChIP-seq experiments.', u'/content/early/2016/05/19/054387', [], [u'The Broad Institute;', u'Weizmann Institute of Science;', u'The Broad institute']]
[u'MDM2 Case Study: Computational Protocol Utilizing Protein Flexibility Improves Ligand Binding Mode Predictions', ['Anthony T Ascone', 'Ridwan Sakidja'], u'May 19, 2016.', u'Recovery of the P53 tumor suppressor pathway via small molecule inhibitors of onco-protein MDM2 highlights the critical role of computational methodologies in targeted cancer therapies. Molecular docking programs in particular, have become an essential tool in computer-aided drug design by providing a quantitative ranking of predicted binding geometries of small ligands to macro-molecular targets based on binding free energy, and allows for the screening of large chemical libraries in search of lead compounds for cancer therapeutics. In this study, we found improved ligand binding mode predictions of small medicinal compounds to MDM2 using AutoDock and AutoDock Vina while adopting a rigid ligand/flexible receptor protocol.  Crystal structures representing small molecule inhibitors bound to MDM2 were selected from the protein data bank and a total of 12 rotatable bonds was supplied to each complex and distributed systematically between the ligand and binding site residues. A docking run was performed for each configuration and evaluated in terms of the top ranked binding free energy and corresponding RMSD from the experimentally known binding site. Results show lowest RMSD values coincide with the ligand having no or few rotatable bonds, while the protein retained all, or the majority of flexibility. Further, we found AutoDock Vina mirrored these results, while requiring substantially less computational time. This study suggests the future implementation of a rigid ligand/flexible receptor protocol may improve accuracy of high throughput screenings of potential cancer drugs targeting the MDM2 protein, while maintaining manageable computational costs. The continued evaluation and optimization of these programs complimented by advanced computer architecture will aide in reducing the cost of cancer drug development, as well as foster new insights into bio-molecular binding processes.', u'/content/early/2016/05/19/054239', [u'Cancer Biology'], [u'Missouri State University']]
[u'LMethyR-SVM: Predict human enhancers using low methylated regions based on weighted support vector machines', ['Yang Dai', 'Jingting Xu', 'Hong Hu'], u'May 19, 2016.', u'Abstract\n\nBackground: \nThe identification of enhancer is a challenging task. Various types of epigenetic information including histone modification have been utilized in the construction of enhancer prediction models based on a diverse panel of machine learning models. However, DNA   methylation profiles generated from the whole genome bisulfate sequencing (WGBS) have not been fully explored for their potential in enhancer prediction despite the fact that low methylated regions (LMRs) have been implied to be distal active regulatory regions.\n\nMethod: \nIn this work we propose a prediction framework, LMethyR-SVM, using LMRs identified from cell-type-specific WGBS DNA methylation profiles based on an unlabeled-negative learning framework. In LMethyR-SVM, the set of cell-type-specific LMRs is further divided into three sets:  reliable positive, like positive, and likely negative, according to their resemblance to a small set of experimentally validated enhancers in the VISTA database based on an estimated non-parametric density distribution. Then, the prediction model is trained by solving a weighted support vector machine.\n\nResults:\nWe demonstrate the performance of LMethyR-SVM by using the WGBS DNA methylation profiles derived from the H1 human embryonic stem cell type (H1) and the fetal lung fibroblast cell type (IMR90). The predicted enhancers are highly conserved with a reasonable validation rate based on a set of commonly used positive markers including transcription factors, p300 binding and DNase-I hypersensitive sites. In addition, we show evidence that the large fraction of LMethyR-SVM predicted enhancers are not predicted by ChromHMM in H1 cell type and they are more enriched for the FANTOM5 enhancers. \n\nConclusion: \nOur work suggests that low methylated regions detected from the WGBS data are useful as complementary resources to histone modification marks in developing models for the prediction of cell type-specific enhancers.', u'/content/early/2016/05/19/054221', [u'Bioinformatics'], [u'University of Illinois at Chicago']]
[u'Reading out olfactory receptors: feedforward circuits detect odors in mixtures without demixing', ['Alexander Mathis', 'Dan Rokni', 'Vikrant Kapoor', 'Matthias Bethge', 'Venkatesh Murthy'], u'May 19, 2016.', u'The olfactory system, like other sensory systems, can detect specific stimuli of interest amidst complex, varying backgrounds. To gain insight into the neural mechanisms underlying this ability, we imaged responses of mouse olfactory bulb glomeruli to single odors and hundreds of  mixtures. We used this data to build a model of mixture responses that incorporated nonlinear interactions and trial-to-trial variability and explored potential decoding mechanisms that can mimic mouse performance from our previous study (Rokni et al., 2014) when given glomerular responses as input. We find that a linear decoder with sparse weights could match mouse performance using just a small subset of the glomeruli (~15). However, when such a decoder is trained only with single odors, it generalizes poorly to mixture stimuli due to nonlinear mixture responses. We show that mice similarly fail to generalize, although they could in principle fully decompose the mixtures. This suggests that mice learn this segregation task discriminatively by adjusting task-specific decision boundaries without taking advantage of a demixed representation of odors.', u'/content/early/2016/05/19/054247', [u'Neuroscience'], [u'Harvard University / University of Tuebingen;', u'Harvard University;', u'University of Tuebingen']]
[u'WEVOTE: Weighted Voting Taxonomic Identification Method of Microbial Sequences', ['Ahmed Metwally', 'Yang Dai', 'Patricia Finn', 'David Perkins'], u'May 19, 2016.', u'Background: Metagenome shotgun sequencing presents opportunities to identify organisms that may prevent or promote disease. Analysis of sample diversity is achieved by taxonomic identification of metagenomic reads followed by generating an abundance profile. Numerous tools have been developed for taxonomic identification based on different design principles. Tools that have been designed to achieve high precision and practical performance still lack sensitivity. Moreover, tools with the highest sensitivity suffer from low precision, low specificity along with long computation time.\n\nMethods: In this paper, we present WEVOTE (WEighted VOting Taxonomic idEntification), a method that classifies metagenome shotgun sequencing DNA reads based on an ensemble of existing methods using k-mer based, marker-based, and naive-similarity based approaches. Our evaluation, based on fourteen benchmarking datasets, shows that WEVOTE reduces occurrence of the false positives to half of that produced by other high sensitive tools while also maintaining the same level of sensitivity.\n\nConclusions: WEVOTE is an efficient, automated tool that combines multiple individual taxonomic identification methods. It is expandable and has the potential to reduce false positives and produce a more accurate taxonomic identification for microbiome data.

Nonetheless, previous methods failed to combine information from both sources to accurately reconstruct clonal populations in a given tumor sample or in a set of tumor samples coming from the same patient. Moreover, previous methods accepted as input all variants predicted by variant-callers, regardless of differences in dispersion of variant allele frequencies (VAFs) due to uneven depth of coverage and possible presence of strand bias, prohibiting accurate inference of clonal architecture.  We present a general framework for assignment of functional mutations to specific cancer clones, which is based on distinction between passenger variants with expected low dispersion of VAF versus putative functional variants, which may not be used for the reconstruction of cancer clonal architecture but can be assigned to inferred clones at the final stage. The key element of our framework is QuantumClone, a method to cluster variants into clones, which we have thoroughly tested on simulated data. QuantumClone takes into account VAFs and genotypes of corresponding regions together with information about normal cell contamination. We applied our framework to whole genome sequencing data for 19 neuroblastoma trios each including constitutional, diagnosis and relapse samples. We discovered specific pathways recurrently altered by deleterious mutations in different clonal populations. Some such pathways were previously reported (e.g., MAPK and neuritogenesis) while some were novel (e.g., epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition, cell survival and DNA repair).

However, its role in heritable mutagenesis remains very poorly understood. Recent studies have demonstrated that both in yeast and in human cancerous cells, most of APOBEC3A/B-induced mutations occur on the lagging strand during replication. Here, we use data on rare human polymorphisms, interspecies divergence, and de novo mutations to study germline mutagenesis, and analyze mutations at nucleotide contexts prone to attack by APOBEC3A/B. We show that such mutations occur preferentially on the lagging strand. Moreover, we demonstrate that APOBEC3A/B-like mutations tend to produce strand-coordinated clusters, which are also biased towards the lagging strand. Finally, we show that the mutation rate is increased 3' of C->G mutations to a greater extent than 3' of C->T mutations, suggesting pervasive translesion bypass of the APOBEC3A/B-induced damage. Our study demonstrates that 20% of C->T and C->G mutations segregating as polymorphisms in human population are attributable to APOBEC3A/B activity.", u'/content/early/2016/05/19/054197', [u'Molecular Biology'], [u'IITP;', u'IITP, MSU']]

Mark Settles'], u'May 19, 2016.', u'Parent-of-origin effect loci have non-Mendelian inheritance in which phenotypes are determined by either the maternal or paternal allele alone. In angiosperms, parent-of-origin effects can be caused by loci required for gametophyte development or by imprinted genes needed for seed development. Few parent-of-origin effect loci have been identified in maize (Zea mays) even though there are a large number of imprinted genes known from transcriptomics. We screened rough endosperm (rgh) mutants for parent-of-origin effects using reciprocal crosses with inbred parents. Six maternal rough endosperm (mre) and three paternal rough endosperm (pre) mutants were identified with three mre loci mapped. When inherited from the female parent, mre/+ seeds reduce grain-fill with a rough, etched, or pitted endosperm surface. Pollen transmission of pre mutants results in rgh endosperm as well as embryo lethality. Eight of the loci had significant distortion from the expected one-to-one ratio for parent-of-origin effects. Linked markers for mre1, mre2, and mre3 indicated that the mutant alleles have no bias in transmission. Histological analysis of mre1, mre2, mre3, and pre*-949 showed altered timing of starch grain accumulation and basal endosperm transfer cell layer (BETL) development. The mre1 locus delays BETL and starchy endosperm development, while mre2 and pre*-949 cause ectopic starchy endosperm differentiation. We conclude that many parent-of-origin effects in maize have incomplete penetrance of kernel phenotypes and that there is a large diversity of endosperm developmental roles for parent-of-origin effect loci.', u'/content/early/2016/05/19/054338', [u'Genetics'], [u'University of Florida, United States;', u'Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, United States;', u'Carnegie Institution for Science, United States']]
