[u'Quantifying the degree of sharing of genetic and non-genetic causes of gene expression variability across four tissues.', ['Alfonso Buil', 'Ana Vinuela', 'Andrew Brown', 'Matthew Davies', 'Ismael Padioleau', 'Deborah Bielser', 'Luciana Romano', 'Daniel Glass', 'Paola Di Meglio', 'Kerrin Small', 'Timothy Spector', 'Emmanouil T Dermitzakis'], u'May 13, 2016.', u'Gene expression can provide biological mechanisms which underlie genetic associations with complex traits and diseases, but often the most relevant tissue for the trait is inaccessible and a proxy is the only alternative. Here, we investigate shared and tissue specific patterns of variability in expression in multiple tissues, to quantify the degree of sharing of causes (genetic or non-genetic) of variability in gene expression among tissues. Using gene expression in ~800 female twins from the TwinsUK cohort in skin, fat, whole blood and lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), we identified 9166 significant cis-eQTLs in fat, 9551 in LCLs, 8731 in skin and 5313 in blood (1% FDR). We observed up to 80% of cis-eQTLs are shared in pairs of tissues. In addition, the cis genetic correlation between tissues is > 90% for 35% of the genes, indicating for these genes a largely tissue-shared component of cis regulation. However, variance components show that cis genetic signals explain only a small fraction of the variation in expression, with from 67-87% of the variance explained by environmental factors, and 53% of the genetic effects occurring in trans. We observe a trans genetic correlation of 0 for all genes except a few which show correlation between fat and skin expression. The environmental effects are also observed to be entirely tissue specific, despite related tissues largely sharing exposures. These results demonstrate that patterns of gene expression are largely tissue specific, strongly supporting the need to study higher order regulatory interactions in the appropriate tissue context with large samples sizes and diversity of environmental contexts.', u'/content/early/2016/05/13/053355', [u'Genomics'], [u'University of Geneva;', u'Kings College London;', u'Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute']]
[u'The multiple testing burden in sequencing-based disease studies of global populations', ['Sara Leslie Pulit', 'Sera A. Jytte de With', 'Paul I Wen de Bakker'], u'May 13, 2016.', u'Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of common disease have been hugely successful in implicating loci that modify disease risk. The bulk of these associations have proven robust and reproducible, in part due to community adoption of statistical criteria for claiming significant genotype-phenotype associations. Currently, studies of common disease are rapidly shifting towards the use of sequencing technologies. As the cost of sequencing drops, assembling large samples in global populations is becoming increasingly feasible. Sequencing studies interrogate not only common variants, as was true for genotyping-based GWAS, but variation across the full allele frequency spectrum, yielding many more (independent) statistical tests. We sought to empirically determine genome-wide significance for various analysis scenarios. Using whole-genome sequence data, we simulated sequencing-based disease studies of varying sample size and ancestry. We determined that future sequencing efforts in > 2,000 samples should practically employ a genome-wide significance threshold of of p < 5 x 10-9, though the threshold does vary with ancestry. Studies of European or East Asian ancestry should set genome-wide significance at approximately p < 5 x 10-9, but similar studies of African or South Asian samples should be more stringent (p < 1 x 10-9). Because sequencing analysis brings with it many challenges (especially for rare variants), appropriate adoption of a revised multiple test correction will be crucial to avoid irreproducible claims of association.', u'/content/early/2016/05/13/053264', [u'Genetics'], [u'University Medical Center Utrecht']]
[u'Exact Bayesian lineage tree-based inference identifies Nanog negative autoregulation in mouse embryonic stem cells', ['Justin Shane Feigelman', 'Stefan Ganscha', 'Simon Hastreiter', 'Michael Schwarzfischer', 'Adam Filipczyk', 'Timm Schroeder', 'Fabian J Theis', 'Carsten Marr', 'Manfred Claassen'], u'May 13, 2016.', u'The autoregulatory motif of Nanog, a heterogeneously expressed core pluripotency factor in mouse embryonic stem cells, remains debated. Although recent time-lapse microscopy data provide the unparalleled ability to monitor Nanog expression at the single-cell level, the extraction of mechanistic knowledge is precluded by the lack of inference techniques suitable for noisy, incomplete and heterogeneous data obtained from proliferating cell populations. \n\nThis work identifies Nanogs autoregulatory motif from quantified time-lapse fluorescence lineage trees with STILT (Stochastic Inference on Lineage Trees), a novel particle-filter based algorithm for exact Bayesian parameter inference and model selection of stochastic models. We first verify STILTs ability to accurately infer parameters and select the correct autoregulatory motif from simulated data. We then apply STILT to time-lapse microscopy movies of a fluorescent Nanog fusion protein reporter and reject the possibility of positive autoregulation. Finally, we use STILT for experimental design, perform in silico overexpression simulations, and experimentally validate model predictions via exogenous Nanog overexpression. We finally conclude that the protein expression dynamics and overexpression experiments strongly suggest a weak negative feedback from the protein on the DNA activation rate. \n\nWe find that a simple autoregulatory mechanism can explain the observed heterogeneous Nanog dynamics. This finding has implications on the understanding of the core pluripotency network, such as supporting the ability of mESC populations to diversify their proteomic profile to respond to a spectrum of differentiation cues. Beyond this application STILT constitutes a generally applicable fully Bayesian approach for model selection of gene regulatory models on the basis of time-lapse imaging data of proliferating cell populations.

Our analysis\nstrongly supports a repertoire of nine opsin paralogs in the bilaterian\nancestor and four opsin paralogs in the last common ancestor of\ncnidarians+bilaterians. Thus we have found a greater opsin diversity\nearlier in animal history than previously known.

Among many hypotheses, newly established host populations may benefit from a "parasite release" through impoverishment of their original parasite communities or reduced infection levels. Moreover, the fitness of competing native hosts may be affected by the acquisition of exotic taxa from invaders ("parasite spill-over") and/or by an increased transmission risk of native parasites due to their amplification by invaders ("parasite spill-back"). We focused on gastrointestinal helminth (GIH) communities to determine whether these predictions could explain the ongoing invasion success of the commensal house mouse (Mus musculus domesticus) and black rat (Rattus rattus), as well as the associated drop of native Mastomys species, in Senegal. A decrease of overall prevalence and individual species richness of GIH were observed along the invasion gradients as well as lower specific prevalence/abundance (Aspiculuris tetraptera in M. m. domesticus, Hymenolepis diminuta in R. rattus) on the invasion front. Conversely, we did not find any strong evidence of GIH spill-over or spill-back in invasion fronts, where native and invasive rodents co-occurred. For both invasive species, our results were consistent with the predictions of the parasite release hypothesis. Further experimental research is needed to determine whether and how the loss of GIH and reduced infection levels along invasion routes may result in any advantageous effects on invader fitness and competitive advantage.', u'/content/early/2016/05/13/053082', [u'Ecology'], [u'IRD, CBGP-BIOPASS;', u'Laboratory of Parasitology, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Barcelona;', u'INRA-CBGP;', u'IRD-LPED;', u'INA-CBGP;', u'IRD-CBGP;', u'Finnish Museum of Natural History Luomus, University of Helsinki, Finland']]

Escherichia Coli blood stream infections are a more major concern in Europe given their incidence and severe associated outcomes. Additionally the level of 3rd generation cephalosporins and carbapenems resistance among those bacteraemias has significantly increased, limiting available treatment options. We estimated the current burden associated with E. coli blood stream infections in Europe at 17,000 (95%CI [8,000; 30,000]) excess deaths and 960,000 (95%CI [600,000; 1,450,000]) extra hospital bed days. From those, the contribution due to 3rd generation cephalosporins and carbapenems resistant strains reached 6,000 (95%CI [2,000; 12,000]) excess deaths, and 200,000 (95%CI [76,000; 420,000]) extra hospital bed stay. In the worst case scenario, we estimated the burden of E. coli blood stream infection in 2026 could increase over 4-fold, mostly resulting from an increase in the level of resistance rather than an increase in the incidence of blood stream infections. Finally, we estimated that the impact of combined novel diagnostics and treatments could substantially reduce the excess mortality by 18.5% to 55.5%, and length of stay by 13.2% to 75.6%.', u'/content/early/2016/05/13/052944', [u'Epidemiology'], [u'Imperial College London;', u'Public Health England']]
[u'Cell-to-cell spread of microsporidia causes C. elegans organs to form syncytia', ['Keir M Balla', 'Robert J Luallen', 'Malina A Bakowski', 'Emily R Troemel'], u'May 13, 2016.', u'Pathogen growth is dictated by interactions with the host environment. Many obligate intracellular pathogens undergo several cellular decisions as they progress through their life cycles inside of host cells. We studied this process for several species of microsporidia in the genus Nematocida in their co-evolved animal host Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that microsporidia can restructure multicellular host tissues into a single contiguous multinucleate cell. In particular, we found that all three Nematocida species we studied were able to spread across the cells of C. elegans tissues before forming spores, with two species causing syncytial formation in the intestine, and one species causing syncytial formation in the muscle. We also found that the decision to switch from replication to differentiation in N. parisii was altered by the density of infection, suggesting that environmental cues influence the dynamics of the pathogen life cycle. These findings show how microsporidia can maximize the use of host space for growth, and that environmental cues in the host can regulate a developmental switch in the pathogen.', u'/content/early/2016/05/13/053181', [u'Cell Biology'], [u'University of California San Diego;', u'Calibr']]

Cells located in the caudal part of the embryo divide and rearrange to participate in the elongation of the different embryonic tissues (e.g. neural tube, axial and paraxial mesoderm, lateral plate, ectoderm, endoderm). We previously identified the paraxial mesoderm as a crucial player of axis elongation, but how movements and growth are coordinated between the different posterior tissues to drive morphogenesis remain largely unknown. Here we use the quail embryo as a model system to quantify cell behavior and movements in the different tissues of the elongating embryo. We first quantify tissue-specific contribution to axis elongation by using 3D volumetric techniques, then quantify tissue-specific parameters such as cell density and proliferation at different embryonic stages. To be able to study cell behavior at a multi-tissue scale we used high-resolution 4D imaging of transgenic quail embryos expressing constitutively expressed fluorescent proteins. We developed specific tracking and image analysis techniques to analyze cell motion and compute tissue deformations in 4D. This analysis reveals extensive sliding between tissues during axis extension. Further quantification of tissue tectonics revealed patterns of rotations, contractions and expansions, which are coherent with the multi-tissue behavior observed previously. Our results confirm the central role of the PSM in axis extension; we propose that the PSM-specific cell proliferation and migration programs control the coordination of elongation between tissues during axis extension.', u'/content/early/2016/05/13/053124', [u'Developmental Biology'], [u'CNRS (France)/ CHLA (USA);', u'Mc Gill Montreal, Canada;', u'CHLA (USA);', u'Northern Michigan University (USA);', u'CHLA/USC (USA);', u'IGBMC (France)/Harvard medical school(USA);', u'Mc Gill Montreal Canada;', u'CHLA/Keck school of medecine USC (USA)']]

Half-maximal responses (EC50s) for transcriptional activation of sturgeon MR by 11-deoxycorticosterone, corticosterone, 11-deoxycortisol, cortisol and aldosterone, and progesterone were between 13 pM and 150 pM.  Gar MR EC50s were between 8 pM and 55 pM.  Such low EC50s support regulation of MR activity by these steroids in sturgeon and gar.  Companion studies with human MR and zebrafish MR found higher EC50s compared to EC50s for sturgeon and gar MR, with EC50s for zebrafish MR closer to gar and sturgeon MR than was human MR.  Zebrafish MR EC50s were between 75 pM and 740 pM; for human MR, EC50s were between 65 pM and 2 nM.  Unexpectedly, progesterone was an agonist for all ray-finned fish MRs, in contrast to its antagonist activity for human MR.  Sturgeon, gar and zebrafish MRs contain a serine corresponding to serine-810 in human MR, hypothesized as critical for progesterone antagonism.  Progesterone is an agonist forSer810Leu MR.

The majority of RNA-Seq analyses begin by mapping each experimentally produced sequence (i.e., read) to a set of annotated reference sequences for the organism of interest. For both biological and technical reasons, a significant fraction of reads remains unmapped. In this work we develop a read origin protocol (ROP) aimed at discovering the source of all reads, originated from complex RNA molecules, recombinant antibodies and microbial communities. Our approach can account for 98.8% of all reads across poly(A) and ribo-depletion protocols. Furthermore, using ROP we show that immune profiles of asthmatic individuals are significantly different from the control individuals with decreased average per sample T-cell/B-cell receptor diversity and that immune diversity is inversely correlated with microbial load.

In a recent study, high-density cross-linking/mass spectrometry data in combination with ab initio structure prediction by conformational space search determined the structure of human serum albumin (HSA) domains, with an RMSD to X-ray structure of up to 2.53 \xc5, or 3.38 \xc5 in the context of blood serum. This paper reports the blind test on the readiness of this technology through the help of Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP). We identified between 201-381 unique residue pairs at an estimated 5% FDR (at link level albeit with missing site assignment precision evaluation), for the four proteins that we provided data for. This equates to between 0.63-1.20 proximal residues per residue, which is comparable to that obtained in the HSA study (0.85 links per residue at 5% FDR). Nevertheless, initial results of CASP11 have suggested that improvements in structure prediction using cross-link data are slight. Most significantly, however, CASP11 revealed to us some of the current limitations of cross-linking, spelling out areas in which the method must develop in future: links spread unevenly over sequence and beta sheets both lacked links and suffered from weak definition of observed links over structure.
