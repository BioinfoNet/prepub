To examine the region's human prehistory prior to the arrival of migrants from East and West Africa or Eurasia in the last 1,700 years, we generated and analyzed genome sequence data from seven ancient individuals from KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Three Stone Age hunter-gatherers date to ~2,000 years ago, and we show that they were related to current-day southern San groups such as the Karretjie People. Four Iron Age farmers (300-500 years old) have genetic signatures similar to present day Bantu-speakers. The genome sequence (13x coverage) of a juvenile boy from Ballito Bay, who lived ~2,000 years ago, demonstrates that southern African Stone Age hunter-gatherers were not impacted by recent admixture; however, we estimate that all modern-day Khoekhoe and San groups have been influenced by 9-22% genetic admixture from East African/Eurasian pastoralist groups arriving >1,000 years ago, including the Ju|'hoansi San, previously thought to have very low levels of admixture. Using traditional and new approaches, we estimate the population divergence time between the Ballito Bay boy and other groups to beyond 260,000 years ago. These estimates dramatically increases the deepest divergence amongst modern humans, coincide with the onset of the Middle Stone Age in sub-Saharan Africa, and coincide with anatomical developments of archaic humans into modern humans as represented in the local fossil record. Cumulatively, cross-disciplinary records increasingly point to southern Africa as a potential (not necessarily exclusive) 'hot spot' for the evolution of our species.", u'/content/early/2017/06/05/145409', [], [u'Uppsala University;', u'University of the Witwatersrand;', u'University of the Witwatersrand and National Health Laboratory Service;', u'University of Johannesburg']]
[u"A cross-sectional study of set shifting impairments and falling in individuals with and without Parkinson's disease", ['Johnathan McKay', 'Kimberly C. Lang', 'Lena Ting', 'Madeleine Hackney'], u'June 5, 2017.', u"INTRODUCTION. Individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) are at increased risk for falls, and exhibit deficits in executive function, including Set Shifting, which can be measured as the difference between parts B and A of the Trailmaking Test.  METHODS. We conducted a cross- sectional study using baseline data of PD patients with and without freezing of gait (FOG) (n=69) and community-dwelling neurologically-normal older adults (NON-PD) (n=84) who had volunteered to participate in clinical rehabilitation research. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine associations between Set Shifting, PD, and faller status, as determined by \u22651 self-reported falls in the previous 6 months, after adjusting for demographic and cognitive factors and clinical disease characteristics.  RESULTS. Impaired Set Shifting was associated with previous falls after controlling for age, sex, overall cognitive function, PD, FOG, and PD disease duration (OR=1.29 [1.03-1.60]; P=0.02). In models controlling for age, sex, and overall cognitive function, PD was associated with increased fall prevalence among the study sample (OR=4.15 [95% CI 1.65-10.44], P<0.01) and FOG was associated with increased fall prevalence among the PD sample (OR=3.63 [1.22-10.80], P=0.02). Although the strongest associations between Set Shifting and falling were observed among PD without FOG (OR=2.11) compared to HOA (OR=1.14) and PD with FOG (OR=1.46) in a multivariate model that allowed for interaction between set shifting and PD status, there was insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis of no interaction.  CONCLUSIONS. Set Shifting is associated with previous falls in non-demented older adults with and without PD.", u'/content/early/2017/06/05/146332', [], [u'Emory University/Georgia Tech;', u'Emory University']]
[u'Modeling dispersion improves decoding of population neural responses', ['Abed Ghanbari', 'Ian Stevenson'], u'June 5, 2017.', u'Neural responses to repeated presentations of an identical stimulus often show substantial trial-to-trial variability. Although the mean firing rate in response to different stimuli or during different movements (tuning curves) have been extensively modeled, the variability of neural responses can also have clear tuning independent of the tuning in the firing rate. This suggests that the variability carries information regarding the stimulus/movement beyond what is encoded in the mean firing rate. Here we demonstrate how taking variability into account can improve neural decoding. In a typical neural coding model spike counts are assumed to be Poisson with the mean response depending on an external variable, such as a stimulus/movement direction. Bayesian decoding methods then use the probabilities under these Poisson tuning models (the likelihood) to estimate the probability of each stimulus given the spikes on a given trial (the posterior). However, under the Poisson model, spike count variability is always exactly equal to the mean (Fano Factor = 1). Here we use the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson (COM-Poisson) model to more flexibly model how neural variability depends on external stimuli. This model contains the Poisson distribution as a special case, but has an additional parameter that allows both over- and underdispersed data, where the variance is greater than (Fano Factor >1) or less than (Fano Factor <1) the mean, respectively. We find that neural responses in both primary motor cortex (M1) and primary visual cortex (V1) have diverse tuning in both their mean firing rates and response variability. These tuning patterns can be accurately described by the COM-Poisson model, and, in both cortical areas, we find that a Bayesian decoder using the COM-Poisson models improves stimulus/movement estimation by 4-8% compared to the Poisson model. The additional layer of information in response variability thus appears to be an important part of the neural code.', u'/content/early/2017/06/05/146415', [], [u'University of Connecticut']]
[u'The Evolutionary Genomics of Grape (Vitis vinifera ssp. vinifera) Domestication', ['Yongfeng Zhou', 'Melanie Massonnet', 'Jaleal Sanjak', 'Dario Cantu', 'Brandon S. Gaut'], u'June 5, 2017.', u'The domestication history of grapes (Vitis vinifera ssp. vinifera) has not yet been investigated with genome sequencing data. We gathered data for a sample of 18 cultivars and nine putatively wild accessions to address three features of domestication history. The first was demography. We estimated that the wild and cultivated samples diverged ~22,000 years ago. Thereafter the cultivated lineage experienced a steady decline in population size (Ne), reaching its nadir near the time of domestication ~8,000 years ago. The long decline may reflect low intensity cultivation by humans prior to domestication. Ne of the wild sample fluctuated over the same timeframe, commensurate with glacial expansion and retraction. Second, we characterized regions of putative selective sweeps, identifying 309 candidate-selected genes in the cultivated sample. The set included genes that function in sugar metabolism, flower development and stress responses. Selected genes in the wild sample were enriched exclusively for functions related to biotic and abiotic stresses. A genomic region of high differentiation between wild and domesticated samples corresponded to the sex determination region, which included a candidate gene for a male sterility factor and additional genes that vary in gene expression among sexes. Finally, we investigated the cost of domestication. Despite the lack of a strong domestication bottleneck, grape accessions contained 5.2% more deleterious variants than wild individuals, and these were more often in a heterozygous state. We confirm that clonal propagation leads to the accumulation of recessive deleterious mutations, which is a likely cause of severe inbreeding depression in grapes.', u'/content/early/2017/06/05/146373', [], [u'University of California, Irvine;', u'University of California, Davis;', u'University of California Irvine;', u'University of California Davis']]
[u'Separable Fully Connected Layers Improve Deep Learning Models For Genomics', ['Amr Mohamed Alexandari', 'Avanti Shrikumar', 'Anshul Kundaje'], u'June 5, 2017.', u'Convolutional neural networks are rapidly gaining popularity in regulatory genomics. Typically, these networks have a stack of convolutional and pooling layers, followed by one or more fully connected layers. In genomics, the same positional patterns are often present across multiple convolutional channels. Therefore, in current state-of-the-art networks, there exists significant redundancy in the representations learned by standard fully connected layers. We present a new separable fully connected layer that learns a weights tensor that is the outer product of positional weights and cross-channel weights, thereby allowing the same positional patterns to be applied across multiple convolutional channels. Decomposing positional and cross-channel weights further enables us to readily impose biologically inspired constraints on positional weights, such as symmetry. We also propose a novel regularizer that penalizes curvature in the positional weights. Using experiments on simulated and in vivo datasets, we show that networks that incorporate our separable fully connected layer outperform conventional models with analogous architectures and the same number of parameters. Additionally, our networks are more robust to hyperparameter tuning, have more informative gradients, and produce importance scores that are more consistent with known biology than conventional deep neural networks.

[u'LSD1/KDM1A Maintains Genome-wide Homeostasis of Transcriptional Enhancers', ['Saurabh Agarwal', 'Patricia Marie Garay', 'Robert Scott Porter', 'Emily Brookes', 'Yumie Murata-Nakamura', 'Todd S. Macfarlan', 'Bing Ren', 'Shigeki Iwase'], u'June 5, 2017.', u'Transcriptional enhancers enable exquisite spatiotemporal control of gene expression in metazoans. Enrichment of mono-methylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me1) is a major chromatin signature that distinguishes enhancers from gene promoters. Lysine Specific Demethylase 1 (LSD1), an enzyme specific for demethylating H3K4me2/me1, has been shown to decommission stem cell enhancers during the differentiation of mES cells (mESC). However, the roles of LSD1 in undifferentiated mESC remain obscure. Here, we show that LSD1 occupies a large fraction of enhancers (63%) that are primed with binding of transcription factors (TFs) and H3K4me1 in mESC. In contrast, LSD1 is largely absent at latent enhancers, which are not yet primed. Unexpectedly, LSD1 levels at enhancers exhibited a clear positive correlation with its substrate, H3K4me2 and enhancer activity. These enhancers gain additional H3K4 methylation upon the loss of LSD1 in mESC. The aberrant increase in H3K4me was accompanied with increases in enhancer H3K27 acetylation and expression of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) and their target genes. In post-mitotic neurons, loss of LSD1 resulted in premature activation of enhancers and genes that are normally induced after neuronal activation. These results demonstrate that LSD1 is a versatile suppressor of primed enhancers, and is involved in homeostasis of enhancer activity.', u'/content/early/2017/06/05/146357', [], [u'Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Univ. of California, San Diego, Univ. of Michigan;', u'Neuroscience Graduate Program, The University of Michigan Medical School;', u'Department of Human Genetics, University of Michigan Medical School;', u'Division of Newborn Medicine, Boston Childrens Hospital;', u'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health;', u'Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, University of California, San Diego School of Medicine;', u'The University of Michigan']]

However, whether distinct patterns of activity induce different sets of ARGs is unknown. In genome-scale experiments, we reveal that a neuron's activity-pattern history can be predicted from the ARGs it expresses. Surprisingly, brief activity selectively induces a small subset of the ARG program that that corresponds precisely to the first of three temporal waves of genes induced by sustained activity. These first-wave genes are distinguished by an open chromatin state, proximity to rapidly activated enhancers, and a requirement for MAPK/ERK signaling for their induction. MAPK/ERK mediates rapid RNA polymerase recruitment to promoters, as well as enhancer RNA induction but not histone acetylation at enhancers. Thus, the same mechanisms that establish the multi-wave temporal structure of ARG induction also enable different sets of genes to be induced by distinct activity patterns.", u'/content/early/2017/06/05/146282', [], [u'Department of Genetics, Harvard Medical School;', u'University of California, Merced;', u'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, National Institutes of Health']]
[u'Bacterial lipopolysaccharide reduces the stability of avian and human influenza viruses', ['Christopher Bandoro', 'Jonathan Runstadler'], u'June 5, 2017.', u"Commensal bacteria can promote or reduce the severity of viral infection and disease progression in their hosts depending on the specific viral pathogen. Influenza A virus (IAV) has a broad host-range, comprises many subtypes, and utilizes different routes of transmission including the fecal-oral route in wild birds. It has been previously demonstrated that commensal bacteria can interact with the host's immune system to protect against IAV pathogenesis. However, it is unclear whether bacteria and their products may be interacting directly with IAV to impact virion stability. Herein we show that gastrointestinal (GI) tract bacterial isolates in an in vitro system significantly reduce the thermal stability of IAV. Moreover, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), found on the exterior surfaces of bacteria, was sufficient to significantly decrease the stability of both human and avian viral strains at the physiological temperatures of their respective hosts, as well as in the aquatic environment. Subtype and host-origin of the viruses were shown to affect the extent to which IAV was susceptible to LPS. Furthermore, using a receptor-binding assay and transmission electron microscopy, we observed that LPS binds to and affects the morphology of influenza virions.", u'/content/early/2017/06/05/146266', [], [u'Massachusetts Institute of Technology']]

However, propagation through the epileptic network, a collection of disparate epileptic nodes, has been theorized. Here, we used a multielectrode array, wide field calcium imaging, and two-photon calcium imaging to study focal seizure propagation pathways in an acute rodent neocortical 4-aminopyridine model. Although ictal neuronal bursts were limited to a 2-3 mm region without clear propagation, they were associated with hemisphere-wide LFP fluctuations and parvalbumin-positive interneuron activity outside the seizure focus. Globally compromising this inhibitory response using bicuculline surface application resulted in classical contiguous propagation; whereas, focal bicuculline microinjection resulted in epileptic network formation with two physically disparate foci. Our study suggests both classical and epileptic network propagation could arise from inhibition defects without pre-existing pathological connectivity changes, and that preferred propagation pathways may result from variations in cortical topology.', u'/content/early/2017/06/05/146407', [], [u'Columbia University;', u'Cornell University']]
[u'MEA Viewer: a High-performance Interactive Application for Visualizing Electrophysiological Data', ['Daniel C. Bridges', 'Kenneth R. Tovar', 'Bian Wu', 'Paul K. Hansma', 'Kenneth S. Kosik'], u'June 5, 2017.', u'Multi-electrode arrays (MEAs) have been used for many years to measure electrical activity in ensembles of many hundreds of neurons, and are used in research areas as diverse as neuronal connectivity and drug discovery. A high sampling frequency is required to adequately capture action potentials, also known as spikes, the primary electrical event associated with neuronal activity, and the resulting raw data files are large and difficult to visualize with traditional plotting tools. Many common approaches to deal with this issue, such as extracting spikes times and solely performing spike train analysis, significantly reduce data dimensionality. Unbiased data exploration benefits from the use of tools that minimize data transforms and such tools enable the development of heuristic perspective from data prior to any subsequent processing. Here we introduce MEA Viewer, a high-performance interactive application for the direct visualization of multi-channel electrophysiological data. MEA Viewer provides many high-performance visualizations of electrophysiological data, including an easily navigable overview of all recorded extracellular signals overlaid with spike timestamp data and an interactive raster plot. Beyond the fundamental data displays, MEA Viewer can signal average and spatially overlay the extent of action potential propagation within single neurons. This view extracts information below the spike detection threshold to directly visualize the propagation of action potentials across the plane of the MEA.
