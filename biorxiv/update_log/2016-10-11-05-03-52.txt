A new but controversial hypothesis postulates that stringent levels of environmental and biotic standardization in experimental studies reduces reproducibility by amplifying impacts of lab-specific environmental factors not accounted for in study designs. A corollary to this hypothesis is that the deliberate introduction of controlled systematic variability (CSV) in experimental designs can increase reproducibility. We tested this hypothesis using a multi-laboratory microcosm study in which the same ecological experiment was repeated in 14 laboratories. Each laboratory introduced environmental and genotypic CSV within and among treatments in replicated microcosms established in either growth chambers (with stringent control of environmental conditions) or glasshouses (with more variable environmental conditions). The introduction of genotypic CSV increased reproducibility of results in growth chambers but had no significant effect in glasshouses where reproducibility also was lower. Environmental CSV had little effect on reproducibility. This first deliberate attempt at reproducing an ecological experiment with added CSV reveals that introducing genotypic CSV in experiments carried out under controlled environmental conditions with stringent standardization can increase reproducibility by buffering against unaccounted lab-specific environmental and biotic factors that may otherwise strongly bias experimental outcomes.', u'/content/early/2016/10/10/080119', [], [u'CNRS;', u"Institut des Sciences de l'Ecologie et de l'Environnement de Paris;", u'Harvard University;', u'IRD;', u'Georg August University Gottingen;', u'INRA;', u'University of Freiburg;', u'ENS;', u'German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research;', u'ZALF;', u'University of Turin;', u'Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry;', u'University of Reading;', u'University of Cologne;', u'ETH Zurich;', u'Senckenberg Biodiversitat und Klima Forschungszentrum']]

Rule-based and machine learning techniques are two approaches to solving this problem. In this study, we trained a machine learning model on pathology reports to extract pertinent tumor characteristics, which enabled us to create a large database of attribute searchable pathology reports. This database can be used to identify cohorts of patients with characteristics of interest.\n\nMethods: We collected a total of 91,505 breast pathology reports from three Partners hospitals: Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), Brigham and Womens Hospital (BWH), and Newton Wellesley Hospital (NWH), covering the period from 1978 to 2016. We trained our system with annotations from two datasets, consisting of 6,295 and 10,841 manually annotated reports. The system extracts 20 separate categories of information, including atypia types and various tumor characteristics such as receptors. We also report a learning curve analysis to show how much annotation our model needs to perform reasonably.\n\nResults: The model accuracy was tested on 500 reports that did not overlap with the training set. The model achieved accuracy of 90% for correctly parsing all carcinoma and atypia categories for a given patient. The average accuracy for individual categories was 97%. Using this classifier, we created a database of 91,505 parsed pathology reports.\n\nConclusions: Our learning curve analysis shows that the model can achieve reasonable results even when trained on a few annotations. We developed a user-friendly interface to the database that allows physicians to easily identify patients with target characteristics and export the matching\ncohort. This model has the potential to reduce the effort required for analyzing large amounts of data from medical records, and to minimize the cost and time required to glean scientific insight from this data.', u'/content/early/2016/10/10/079913', [], [u'Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, CSAIL, MIT;', u'Department of Radiation Oncology, MGH;', u'Division of Surgical Oncology, MGH;', u'Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth;', u'Department of Medical Oncology, MGH;', u'Department of Radiology, MGH;', u'Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University;', u'Department of Medical Oncology, DFCI;', u'Department of Pathology, MGH;', u'Department of Pathology, NWH']]

A common assumption is that cells of the same type will extract a single stimulus feature to form a feature map, but this has rarely been observed directly. Using large-scale recordings in the rat retina, we show that a homogeneous population of fast OFF ganglion cells simultaneously encodes two radically different features of a visual scene. Cells close to a moving object code linearly for its position, while distant cells remain largely invariant to the object's position and, instead, respond non-linearly to changes in the object's speed. Cells switch between these two computations depending on the stimulus. We developed a quantitative model that accounts for this effect and identified a likely disinhibitory circuit that mediates it. Ganglion cells of a single type thus do not code for one, but two features simultaneously. This richer, flexible neural map might also be present in other sensory systems.", u'/content/early/2016/10/10/080135', [u'Neuroscience'], [u'Vision Institute;', u'Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research;', u'Institute of Science and Technology Austria']]
[u'CLEAR: Composition of Likelihoods for Evolve And Resequence Experiments', ['Arya Iranmehr', 'Ali Akbari', 'Christian Schlotterer', 'Vineet Bafna'], u'October 10, 2016.', u'Experimental evolution (EE) studies are powerful tools for observing molecular evolution\nin-action from populations sampled in controlled and natural environments. The advent of\nnext generation sequencing technologies has made whole-genome and whole-population sampling\npossible, even for eukaryotic organisms with large genomes, and allowed us to locate the genes\nand variants responsible for genetic adaptation. While many computational tests have been\ndeveloped for detecting regions under selection, they are mainly designed for static (single time)\ndata, and work best when the favored allele is close to fixation.\nEE studies provide samples over multiple time points, underscoring the need for tools that\ncan exploit the data. At the same time, EE studies are constrained by the limited time span\nsince onset of selection, depending upon the generation time for the organism. This constraint\nimpedes adaptation studies, as the population can only be evolve-and-resequenced for a small\nnumber of generations relative to the fixation time of the favored allele. Moreover, coverage in\npool-sequenced experiments varies across replicates and time points, leading to heterogeneous\nascertainment bias in measuring population allele frequency across different measurements.\nIn this article, we directly address these issues while developing tools for identifying selective\nsweep in pool-sequenced EE of sexual organisms and propose Composition of Likelihoods for\nEvolve-And-Resequence experiments (Clear). Extensive simulations show that Clear achieves\nhigher power in detecting and localizing selection over a wide range of parameters. In contrast\nto existing methods, the Clear statistics are robust to variation of coverage. Clear also\nprovides robust estimates of model parameters, including selection strength and overdominance,\nas byproduct of the statistical test, while being orders of magnitude faster than existing methods.\nFinally, we apply the Clear statistic to data from a study of D. melanogaster adaptation to\nalternating temperatures and discover enrichment of genes related to response to heat and\ncold acclimation.', u'/content/early/2016/10/10/080085', [u'Evolutionary Biology'], [u'UC San Diego;', u'Institut fur Populationsgenetik, Vetmeduni, Vienna']]
[u'Connecting myelin-related and synaptic dysfunction in schizophrenia with SNP-rich gene expression hubs', ['Hedi Hegyi'], u'October 10, 2016.', u"The recent availability of several genome-wide data sets such as genome-wide mapping of SNP-rich regions and differentially methylated genes in schizophrenic individuals and gene expression data in all brain compartments across the span of human life prompted us to integrate these datasets to gain a better insight into the underlying gene networks driving this enigmatic disease.\nWe summed up the differentially methylated 'expression neighbors' (i.e. genes with positively or negatively correlating expression values) of genes that fall into one of 108 distinct schizophrenia-associated genetic loci with high number of SNPs in schizophrenic patients derived from a large cohort of pooled sequencing experiments. Surprisingly, the number of expression neighbors (with a Pearson correlation of R>=0.8 or R<=-0.7) of the genes falling into the 108 genomic regions were about 35 times higher for the positively correlating genes and 32 times higher for the negatively correlating ones than for the rest of the ~16000 genes outside these loci. While the genes in the 108 loci have relatively little known impact in schizophrenia, using this approach we identified many more known schizophrenia-related important genes with a high degree of connectedness to other genes and high scores of differentially methylated probes for their expression neighbors (such as MBP, MOBP, GRIA1, COMT, SYNGR1, MAP2 and DGCR6), validating our approach.\nThe analysis revealed that the most positively correlating as well as the most negatively correlating genes affect synapse-related genes the most, offering an explanation and a unified view into the root cause of schizophrenia.", u'/content/early/2016/10/10/080044', [u'Neuroscience'], [u'CEITEC']]

This can lead to ecological specialization. However, little is known about how zoonotic bacteria maintain the ability to colonize multiple hosts whilst competing with specialists in the same niche. Here we develop a stochastic evolutionary model and show how genetic transfer of niche specifying genes and the opportunity for host transition can interact to promote the emergence of host generalist lineages of the zoonotic bacterium Campylobacter. Using a modelling approach we show that increasing levels of recombination enhance the efficiency with which selection can fix combinations of beneficial alleles, speeding adaptation. We then show how these predictions change in a multi-host system, with low levels of recombination, consistent with real r/m estimates, increasing the standing variation in the population, allowing a more effective response to changes in the selective landscape. Our analysis explains how observed gradients of host specialism and generalism can evolve in a multihost system through the transfer of ecologically important loci among coexisting strains.', u'/content/early/2016/10/10/080077', [u'Microbiology'], [u'University of Warwick, UK;', u'University of Aberdeen, UK;', u'Wesleyan University, USA;', u'University of Bath']]

Yet few would advocate taking the results at face value. Not only is there no agreement on the algorithms themselves, there is no agreement on how to benchmark them. In this paper, we evaluate the robustness and uniqueness of enrichment results as a means of assessing methods even where correctness is unknown. We show that heavily annotated ("multifunctional") genes are likely to appear in genomics study results and drive the generation of biologically non-specific enrichment results as well as highly fragile significances. By providing a means of determining where enrichment analyses report non-specific and non-robust findings, we are able to assess where we can be confident in their use. We find significant progress in recent bias correction methods for enrichment and provide our own software implementation.
