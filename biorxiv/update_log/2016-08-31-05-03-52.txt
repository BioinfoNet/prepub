[u'A revised dilution methodology and implications for estimates of rates of plankton mortality', ['Stephen J Beckett', 'Joshua S Weitz'], u'August 30, 2016.', u'The dilution method is the principal tool used to infer in situ microzooplankton grazing rates. However, grazing is the only mortality process considered by the theoretical model underlying the interpretation of dilution method experiments. We show an alternative interpretation arises when there is concurrent niche competition within the plankton community. We find that grazing rates may be overestimated -- the degree of overestimation is related to the importance of niche competition relative to zooplankton grazing. Thus, we propose a modification to the dilution method to disentangle the effects of niche competition and zooplankton grazing. Our theoretical results suggest the revised "Z-dilution" method can robustly infer grazing mortality, regardless of the dominant plankton mortality driver. Further, we show it is possible to independently estimate both grazing mortality and niche competition when the classical and Z-dilution methods are used in tandem. We discuss the significance of these results for quantifying plankton mortality rates.', u'/content/early/2016/08/30/072231', [], [u'Georgia Institute of Technology']]
[u'Comparative transcriptomics reveal candidate genes involved in the adaptation to non-marine habitats in panpulmonate mollusks', ['Pedro Eduardo Romero', 'Barbara Feldmeyer', 'Markus Pfenninger'], u'August 30, 2016.', u'Background: The conquest of the land from aquatic habitats is a fascinating evolutionary event that happened multiple times in different phyla. Mollusks are among the organisms that successfully invaded the non-marine realm, resulting in the radiation of terrestrial panpulmonate gastropods. We used panpulmonates as a model to illuminate with comparative transcriptomics the selective pressures that shaped the transitions from marine into freshwater and terrestrial realms in this molluscan lineage.  Results: De novo assembly of six panpulmonate transcriptomes resulted in 55,000 to 97,000 predicted open reading frames, of which 9 - 14% were functionally annotated. Adding published transcriptomes, we predicted 791 orthologous clusters shared among fifteen panpulmonate species, resulting in 702 amino acid and 736 codon-wise alignments. The branch-site test of positive selection applied to the codon-wise alignments showed twenty-eight genes under positive selection in the freshwater lineages and seven in the terrestrial lineages. Gene Ontology categories of these candidate genes include actin assembly, transport of glucose, and the tyrosine metabolism in the terrestrial lineages; and, DNA repair, metabolism of xenobiotics, mitochondrial electron transport, and ribosome biogenesis in the freshwater lineages.  Conclusions: We identified candidate genes representing processes that may have played a key role during the water-to-land transition in Panpulmonata. These genes were involved in energy metabolism and gas-exchange surface development in the terrestrial lineages and in the response to the abiotic stress factors (UV radiation, osmotic pressure, xenobiotics) in the freshwater lineages. Our study expands the knowledge of possible adaptive signatures in genes and metabolic pathways related to the invasion of non-marine habitats in invertebrates.', u'/content/early/2016/08/30/072389', [], [u'Senckenberg Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre']]

A remarkable early\nfinding in the study of temporal expectancy is the foreperiod effect on\nreaction times; i.e., the fact that the time period between a warning signal\nand an impendent stimuli, to which subjects are instructed to respond as\nquickly as possible, influences reaction times.

In order to evaluate the potential applications of MNC, we looked for the presence of a fourth dimension's distinctive hallmarks in a temporal sequence of 2D images taken during spontaneous brain activity.  Indeed, recent findings suggest that several brain activities, such as mind-wandering and memory retrieval, might take place in the functional space of a four dimensional hypersphere, which is a double donut-like structure undetectable in the usual three dimensions.

[u'Detecting consistent patterns of directional adaptation using differential selection codon models', ['Sahar Parto', 'Nicolas Lartillot'], u'August 30, 2016.', u'Background: Phylogenetic codon models are often used to characterize the selective regimes acting on protein coding sequences. Recent methodological developments have led to models explicitly accounting for the interplay between mutation and selection, by explicitly modelling the amino acid fitness landscape along the sequence. However, thus far, most of these models have assumed that the fitness landscape is constant over time. Fluctuations of the fitness landscape may often be random or depend on complex and unknown factors. However, some organisms may be subject to systematic changes in selective pressure, resulting in reproducible molecular adaptations across independent lineages subject to similar conditions.  Results: Here, we developed a codon-based differential selection model, which aims to detect and quantify the fine-grained consistent patterns of adaptation at the protein-coding level, as a function of external conditions experienced by the organism under investigation. The model parameterizes the global mutational pressure, as well as the site- and condition-specific amino acid selective preferences. This phylogenetic model is implemented in a Bayesian MCMC framework. After validation with simulations, we applied our method to a dataset of HIV sequences from patients with known HLA genetic background. Our differential selection model detects and characterizes differentially selected coding positions specifically associated with two different HLA alleles.  Conclusion: our differential selection model is able to identify consistent molecular adaptations as a function of repeated changes in the environment of the organism. These models can be applied to many other problems, ranging from viral adaptation to evolution of life-history strategies in plants or animals.', u'/content/early/2016/08/30/072405', [], [u'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, University of Montreal;', u'Biometry and Evolution Laboratory, CNRS, University of Lyon 1']]

Given that each region encompasses numerous variants in high linkage disequilibrium, it is not clear which are i) truly causal or ii) just reasonably close to the causal ones. Researchers proposed many methods to predict, albeit not test, the causal SNPs in a region, a process commonly denoted as fine-mapping. Unfortunately, all existing fine-mapping methods output posterior causality probabilities assuming that causal SNPs are among those already measured in the study, or have been catalogued elsewhere. However, due to technological and computational obstacles in calling many types of genetic variants, such assumption is not realistic. We propose a novel method/software, denoted as Quasi-CAausality Test (QCAT), for testing (not just predicting) the causality of any catalogued genetic variant.  QCAT i) makes no assumption that causal variants are among catalogued variants, and ii) makes use of easily available summary statistics from genetic studies, e.g. variant association Z-scores, to make statistical inferences.

[u'mtDNA diversity in human populations highlights the merit of haplotype matching in gene therapies', ['Ellen Royrvik', 'Joerg Burgstaller', 'Iain Johnston'], u'August 30, 2016.', u'Modern gene therapies aim to prevent the inheritance of mutant mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from mother to offspring by using a thirdparty mtDNA background. Technological limitations mean that these therapies may result in a small amount of maternal mtDNA admixed with a majority of thirdparty mtDNA. This situation is unstable if the mother\'s mtDNA experiences a proliferative advantage over the thirdparty mtDNA, in which case the efficacy of the therapy may be undermined. Animal models suggest that the likelihood of such a proliferative advantage increases with increasing genetic distance between mother and thirdparty mtDNA, but in real therapeutic contexts the genetic distance, and so the importance of this effect, remains unclear. Here we harness a large volume of available human mtDNA data to model random sampling of mother and thirdparty mtDNAs from real human populations. We show that even within the same haplogroup, genetic differences around 2080 SNPs are common between mtDNAs. These values are sufficient to lead to substantial segregation in murine models, over an organismal lifetime, even given low starting heteroplasmy, inducing increases from 5% to 35% over one year. Randomly pairing mothers and thirdparty women in clinical contexts thus runs the risk that substantial mtDNA segregation will compromise the beneficial effects of the therapy. We suggest that choices of "mtDNA donors" be based on recent shared maternal ancestry, or, preferentially, explicit haplotype matching, in order to reduce the potential for problems in the implementation of these therapies.', u'/content/early/2016/08/30/072348', [u'Genetics'], [u'University of Warwick, UK;', u'IFA Tulln, Austria;', u'University of Birmingham, UK']]
[u'A Neural Oscillatory Signature of Reference', ['Mante Nieuwland', 'Andrea E Martin'], u'August 30, 2016.', u'The ability to use words to refer to the world is vital to the communicative power of human language. In particular, the anaphoric use of words to refer to previously mentioned concepts (antecedents) allows dialogue to be coherent and meaningful. Psycholinguistic theory posits that anaphor comprehension involves reactivating a memory representation of the antecedent. Whereas this implies the involvement of recognition memory, the neural processes for reference resolution are largely unknown. Here, we report time-frequency analysis of four EEG experiments to reveal the increased coupling of functional neural systems associated with referentially coherent expressions compared to referentially ambiguous expressions. Despite varying in modality, language, and type of referential expression, all experiments showed larger gamma-band power for coherence compared to ambiguity. Beamformer analysis in high-density Experiment 4 localised this increase to posterior parietal cortex around 400-600 ms after anaphor-onset and to frontal-temporal cortex around 500-1000 ms. We argue that the observed gamma-band power increases reflect successful referential binding and resolution, which links incoming information to antecedents through an interaction between the recognition memory networks and frontal-temporal language network. We integrate these findings with previous results from patient and neuroimaging studies, and outline a nascent cortico-hippocampal theory of reference.', u'/content/early/2016/08/30/072322', [u'Neuroscience'], [u'MPI for Psycholinguistics']]

The evolution of populations of mixed mtDNA types is complicated and poorly understood, and variability of these controlled admixtures plays a central role in the inheritance and onset of genetic disease. Here, we develop a mathematical theory describing the evolution and variability in these stochastic populations for any type of cellular control, showing that cell-to-cell variability in mtDNA, and mutant load, inevitably increases with time, according to rates which we derive and which are notably independent of the mechanistic details of feedback signalling. We show with a set of experimental case studies that this theory explains disparate quantitative results from classical and modern experimental and computational studies on heteroplasmy variance in different species. We demonstrate that our general model provides a host of specific insights, including a modification of the often-used but hard-to-interpret Wright formula to correspond directly to biological observables, the ability to quantify selective and mutational pressure in mtDNA populations, and the pronounced variability inevitably arising from the action of possible mtDNA quality-control mechanisms.

This model was systematically applied to multiple proteins by Mu\xf1oz and Eaton and has since been referred to as the Wako-Sait\xf4-Mu\xf1oz-Eaton (WSME) model.  The success of the WSME model in explaining the folding of many proteins has verified the hypothesis that the folding is dominated by native interactions, which makes the  energy landscape globally biased toward native conformation. Using the WSME and other related models, Sait\xf4 emphasized the importance of the hierarchical pathway in protein folding; folding starts with the creation of  contiguous segments having a native-like configuration and proceeds as growth and coalescence of these segments. The \u03c6-values calculated  for barnase with the WSME model suggested that segments contributing to the folding nucleus are similar to the structural modules defined by the pattern of native atomic contacts. The WSME model was extended to explain folding of multi-domain proteins having  a complex topology, which opened the way to  comprehensively understanding the folding process of multi-domain proteins. The WSME model was also extended to describe allosteric transitions,  indicating that the allosteric structural movement does not occur as a  deterministic sequential change between two conformations but  as a stochastic diffusive motion over the dynamically changing energy landscape.

A growing body of evidence suggests that for successful colonization to occur, (effector/virulence) proteins in insect saliva must modulate plant defense responses to the benefit of the insect. A range of insect saliva proteins that modulate plant defense responses have been identified, but there is no direct evidence that these proteins are delivered into specific plant tissues and enter plant cells. Aphids and other sap-sucking insects of the order Hemiptera use their specialized mouthparts (stylets) to probe plant mesophyll cells, until they reach the phloem cells for long-term feeding. Here we show by immunogold-labeling of ultrathin sections of aphid feeding sites that an immuno-suppressive aphid effector localizes in the cytoplasm of mesophyll cells near aphid stylets, but not in cells further away from aphid feeding sites. In contrast, another aphid effector protein localizes in the sheaths composed of gelling saliva that surround the aphid stylets. Thus, insects deliver effectors directly into plant tissue.

[u'High GC Content Causes De Novo Created Proteins to be Intrinsically Disordered', ['Walter Basile', 'Oxana Sachenkova', 'Sara Light', 'Arne Elofsson'], u'August 30, 2016.', u'De novo creation of protein coding genes involves formation of short ORFs from noncoding regions; some of these ORFs might then become fixed in the population. De novo created proteins need to, at the bare minimum, not cause serious harm to the organism, meaning that they should for instance not cause aggregation. Therefore, although the creation of the short ORFs could be truly random, but the fixation should be of subject to some selective pressure. The selective forces acting on de novo created\nproteins have been elusive and contradictory results have been reported. In Drosophila they are more disordered, i.e. are enriched in polar residues, than ancient proteins, while the opposite trend is present in yeast. To the best of our knowledge no valid explanation for this difference has been proposed.\n\n\nTo solve this riddle we studied structural properties and age of all proteins in 187 eukaryotic species. We find that, on average, there are small differences between proteins of different ages, with the exception that younger proteins are shorter. However, when we take the GC content into account we find that this can explain the opposite trends observed in yeast (low GC) and drosophila (high GC). GC content is correlated with codons coding for disorder-promoting amino acids, and inversely correlated with transmembrane, helix and sheet promoting residues. We find that for the youngest proteins, i.e. the ones that are most likely to be de novo created, there exists a strong correlation with GC and structural properties. In contrast, this strong relationship is not seen for ancient proteins. This leads us to propose that structural features are not a strong determining\nfactor for fixation of de novo created genes. Instead these proteins resemble random proteins given a particular GC level. The dependency on GC content is then gradually weakened during evolution.', u'/content/early/2016/08/30/070003', [u'Evolutionary Biology'], [u'Stockholm University']]
[u'Detecting High-Order Epistasis in Nonlinear Genotype-Phenotype Maps', ['Zachary R Sailer', 'Michael J Harms'], u'August 30, 2016.', u'High-order epistasis has been observed in many genotype-phenotype maps. These multi-way interactions could have profound implications for evolution and may be useful for dissecting complex traits. Previous analyses have assumed a linear genotype-phenotype map, and then applied a linear high-order epistasis model to dissect epistasis. The assumption of linearity has not been tested in most of these data sets. Using simulations, we demonstrate that neglecting nonlinearity leads to spurious high-order epistasis. We find we can account for this nonlinearity in simulated maps using a power transform. We then measure and account for nonlinearity in experimental maps for which high-order epistasis has been previously reported. When applied to seven experimental genotype-phenotype maps, we find that five of the seven exhibited nonlinearity. Correcting for this nonlinearity had a large effect on the magnitudes and signs of the estimated high-order epistatic coefficients, but only a minor effect on additive and pairwise epistatic coefficients. Even after accounting for nonlinearity, we found statistically significant fourth-order epistasis in every map studied. One map even exhibited fifth-order epistasis. The contributions of high-order epistasis to the total variation in the map ranged from 2.2% to 31.0%, with an average across maps of 12.7%. Our work describes a simple method to account for nonlinearity in binary genotype-phenotype maps.

More recently, biophysical models of protein evolution, which combine evolutionary theory with protein biophysics, have completely revolutionized our view of the forces that shape sequence divergence. Slowly evolving proteins have been found to evolve slowly because of selection against toxic misfolding and misinteractions, linking their rate of evolution primarily to their abundance. Similarly, most slowly evolving sites in proteins are not directly involved in function, but mutating them has large impacts on protein structure and stability.

[u'Evolutionary dynamics of an epigenetic switch in a fluctuating environment', ['Mariana Gomez-Schiavon', 'Nicolas E Buchler'], u'August 30, 2016.', u'Adaptation and survival in fluctuating environments is an evolutionary challenge faced by organisms. Epigenetic switches (bistable, molecular systems built from self-reinforcing feedback loops) have been suggested as a mechanism of bet-hedging and adaptation to fluctuating environments. These epigenetic systems are capable of spontaneously switching between phenotypes in the absence of DNA mutation and these phenotypes are stably inherited through multiple cell generations. The extent to which epigenetic switches outcompete adaptation through genetic mutation in fluctuating environments remains unexplored. To better understand the conditions that select for epigenetic switching, we used computer simulation to evolve a mechanistic model of a self-activating genetic circuit, which can adapt genetically and exhibit epigenetic switching. We evolved this model in a fluctuating environment under different selection pressures, mutation step-sizes, population sizes, and fluctuation frequencies. There was a trade-off between minimizing the adaptation time after each environmental transition and increasing the robustness of the phenotype during the constant environment between transitions. We show that surviving lineages evolved bistable, epigenetic switching to adapt quickly in fast fluctuating environments, whereas genetic adaptation was favored in slowly fluctuating environments.

These chemically defended anurans use bright aposematic colors to warn potential predators of their unpalatibility. However, aposematic signals are frequency-dependent and individuals deviating from a local model are at a higher risk of predation. The well-known examples of Batesian and Mullerian mimics, hymenopterans (wasps and bees) and Heliconius butterflies, both support the benefits of unique models with relatively high frequencies. However, extreme diversity in the aposematic signal has been documented in the poison frogs of the genus Dendrobates, especially in the Oophaga subgenus. Here we investigate the phylogenetic and genomic differentiations among populations of Oophaga sylvatica, which exhibit one of the highest phenotypic diversification among poison frogs.

These populations are mostly separated in two lineages distributed in the Northern and the Southern part of their range in Ecuador. We found relatively low genetic differentiation within each lineage, despite considerable phenotypic variation, and evidence suggesting ongoing gene flow and genetic admixture among some populations of the Northern lineage.

For all measurements tested, including air temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure, four component net radiation, and photosynthetically active radiation, the device reported values near or within the accuracy limits as stated by the reference instrument / sensor manufacturer.', u'/content/early/2016/08/30/072108', [u'Ecology'], [u'Arable Labs, Inc;', u'Arable Labs, Inc.']]
[u'Towards comprehensive and quantitative proteomics for diagnosis and therapy of human disease', ['Paolo Cifani', 'Alex Kentsis'], u'August 30, 2016.', u'Despite superior analytical features, mass spectrometry proteomics remains seldom used for the basic investigation and clinical treatment of human disease. This need is particularly pressing for childhood diseases that can be rare in incidence and variable in presentation. Modern mass spectrometry enables detailed functional characterization of the pathogenic biochemical processes, as achieved by accurate and comprehensive quantification of proteins and their regulatory chemical modifications. Here, we describe how high-accuracy mass spectrometry in combination with high-resolution chromatographic separations can be leveraged to meet these analytical requirements in a mechanism-focused manner. We review the quantification methods capable of producing accurate measurements of protein abundance and post-translational modification stoichiometries. We then discuss how experimental design and chromatographic resolution can be leveraged to achieve comprehensive functional characterization of biochemical processes in complex biological proteomes. Finally, we describe current approaches for quantitative analysis of a common functional protein modification: reversible phosphorylation. In all, current instrumentation and methods of high-resolution chromatography and mass spectrometry proteomics are poised for immediate translation into improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for pediatric and adult diseases.', u'/content/early/2016/08/30/072215', [u'Cell Biology'], [u'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center']]
[u'Factors contributing to the accumulation of reproductive isolation: a mixed model approach', ['Dean M Castillo'], u'August 30, 2016.', u'Studies utilizing large data sets that characterize reproductive isolation (the ability to cross and produce hybrids) across species with varying degrees of relatedness have been extremely influential in the study of speciation. However several limitations have made it difficult to test specific hypothesis about factors that predict the evolution of reproductive isolation. In particular, the statistical methods typically used are limited in their ability to test complex hypotheses involving more than one predictor variable; at least one method, the Mantel Test, has also been found to be unreliable. In this paper I describe a framework to determine which factors contribute to the evolution of reproductive isolation using phylogenetic linear mixed models. Phylogenetic linear mixed models do not suffer from the same statistical limitations as other methods and I demonstrate the flexibility of this framework to analyze data collected at different evolutionary scales, to test both categorical and continuous predictor variables, and to test the effect of multiple predictors simultaneously, all of which cannot be achieved using any other single statistical method. I do so by re-analyzing several classic data sets and explicitly testing hypotheses that had previously been untested directly, including differences in accumulation of reproductive isolation between sympatric and allopatric species pairs.', u'/content/early/2016/08/30/072264', [u'Evolutionary Biology'], [u'Indiana University']]
