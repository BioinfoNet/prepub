[u'Genotyping Of Zebrafish Embryos Fixed By Paraformaldehyde', ['Qilin Gu', 'Xiaojie Yang'], u'March 19, 2017.', u'The rapid generation of various species and strains of zebrafish using CRISPR/Cas9 technology has dramatically accelerated the interrogation of gene function in vivo. So far, several approaches for genotyping of unfixed genome-modified animals have been successfully developed, such as Surveyor assays, T7 endonuclease 1 (T7E1) assays, High Resolution Melt Analysis (HRMA) and PAGE-based genotyping approach. However, there is few published genotyping protocol for the embryos of lethal zebrafish mutants fixed by paraformaldehyde. We have designed this genotyping protocol so that it can be performed in a single step with reliable results. The protocol covers all steps to obtain the genotypes.', u'/content/early/2017/03/19/118331', [], [u'Houston Methodist Research Institute']]
[u'Cheating on orthogonal social traits prevents the tragedy of the commons in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>', ['Ozhan Ozkaya', 'Roberto Balbontin', 'Isabel Gordo', 'Karina B. Xavier'], u'March 19, 2017.', u'polymorphic populations under conditions where two social traits, production of iron-scavenging pyoverdine and quorum sensing regulated elastase, are necessary. We demonstrate that cheaters for either trait compete with both the wild type and each other and, since production of pyoverdine is costlier than elastase production, pyoverdine cheaters impair invasion by quorum sensing mutants, preventing the collapse caused by the latter. A mathematical model shows that these dynamics are determined by the costs of the social traits involved, while their benefits only influence population mean fitness. Finally, we show how quorum sensing regulation can avoid full loss of cooperation.', u'/content/early/2017/03/19/118240', [], [u'Instituto Gulbenkian de Ci\xeancia']]
[u'Population Genomics And The Evolution Of Virulence In The Fungal Pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans', ['Christopher Desjardins', 'Charles Giamberardino', 'Sean Sykes', 'Chen-Hsin Yu', 'Jennifer Tenor', 'Yuan Chen', 'Timothy Yang', 'Alexander Jones', 'Sheng Sun', 'Miriam Haverkamp', 'Joseph Heitman', 'Anastasia Litvintseva', 'John Perfect', 'Christina Cuomo'], u'March 19, 2017.', u'Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that causes approximately 625,000 deaths per year from nervous system infections. Here, we leveraged a unique, genetically diverse population of C. neoformans from sub-Saharan Africa, commonly isolated from mopane trees, to determine how selective pressures in the environment coincidentally adapted C. neoformans for human virulence. Genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of 387 isolates, representing the global VNI and African VNB lineages, highlighted a deep, non-recombining split in VNB (herein VNBI and VNBII). VNBII was enriched for clinical samples relative to VNBI, while phenotypic profiling of 183 isolates demonstrated that VNBI isolates were significantly more resistant to oxidative stress and more heavily melanized than VNBII isolates. Lack of melanization in both lineages was associated with loss-of-function mutations in the BZP4 transcription factor. A genome-wide association study across all VNB isolates revealed sequence differences between clinical and environmental isolates in virulence factors and stress response genes. Inositol transporters and catabolism genes, which process sugars present in plants and the human nervous system, were identified as targets of selection in all three lineages. Further phylogenetic and population genomic analyses revealed extensive loss of genetic diversity in VNBI, suggestive of a history of population bottlenecks, along with unique evolutionary trajectories for mating type loci. These data highlight the complex evolutionary interplay between adaptation to natural environments and opportunistic infections, and that selection on specific pathways may predispose isolates to human virulence.', u'/content/early/2017/03/19/118323', [], [u'Broad Institute;', u'Duke University Medical Center;', u'University of Pennsylvania;', u'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention']]
