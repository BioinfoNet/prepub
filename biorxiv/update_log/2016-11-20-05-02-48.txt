[u'Chromatin accessibility dynamics reveal novel functional enhancers in C. elegans', ['Aaron C Daugherty', 'Robin Yeo', 'Jason D Buenrostro', 'William J Greenleaf', 'Anshul Kundaje', 'Anne Brunet'], u'November 19, 2016.', u'Chromatin accessibility, a crucial component of genome regulation, has primarily been studied in homogenous and simple systems, such as isolated cell populations or early development models. Whether chromatin accessibility can be assessed in complex, dynamic systems in vivo with high sensitivity remains largely unexplored.  In this study, we use ATAC-seq to identify chromatin accessibility changes in a whole animal, the model organism C. elegans, from embryogenesis to adulthood. Chromatin accessibility changes between developmental stages are highly reproducible, recapitulate histone modification changes, and reveal key regulatory aspects of the epigenomic landscape throughout organismal development.  Importantly, our analysis of dynamic changes in chromatin accessibility within whole organisms sensitively identified novel cell-type- and temporal-specific enhancers, which we functionally validate in vivo.  Furthermore, by integrating transcription factor binding motifs into a machine learning framework, we identify EOR-1 as a potential early regulator of chromatin accessibility changes.  Our study provides a unique resource for C. elegans, a system in which the prevalence and importance of enhancers remains poorly characterized, and demonstrates the power of using whole organism chromatin accessibility to identify novel regulatory regions in complex systems.', u'/content/early/2016/11/19/088732', [], [u'Stanford University;', u'Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard']]
[u'Identifying Y-chromosome haplogroups in arbitrarily large samples of sequenced or genotyped men', ['G. David Poznik'], u'November 19, 2016.', u'We have developed an algorithm to rapidly and accurately identify the Y-chromosome haplogroup of each male in a sample of one to millions. The algorithm, implemented in the yHaplo software package (yHaplo), does not rely on any particular genotyping modality or platform. Full sequences yield the most granular haplogroup classifications, but genotyping arrays can yield reliable calls, provided a reasonable number of phylogenetically informative variants has been assayed. The algorithm is robust to missing data, genotype errors, mutation recurrence, and other complications. We have tested the software on full sequences from phase 3 of the 1000 Genomes Project and on subsets thereof constructed by downsampling to SNPs present on each of four genotyping arrays. We have also run the software on array data from more than 600,000 males.', u'/content/early/2016/11/19/088716', [u'Genetics'], [u'23andMe']]

To help address this difficulty, we developed Ragout, a reference-assisted assembly tool that now works for large and complex genomes. Taking one or more target assemblies (generated from an NGS assembler) and one or multiple related reference genomes, Ragout infers the evolutionary relationships between the genomes and builds the final assemblies using a genome rearrangement approach. Using Ragout, we transformed NGS assemblies of 15 different Mus musculus and one Mus spretus genomes into sets of complete chromosomes, leaving less than 5% of sequence unlocalized per set. Various benchmarks, including PCR testing and realigning of long PacBio reads, suggest only a small number of structural errors in the final assemblies, comparable with direct assembly approaches. Additionally, we applied Ragout to Mus caroli and Mus pahari genomes, which exhibit karyotype-scale variations compared to other genomes from the Muridae family. Chromosome color maps confirmed most large-scale rearrangements that Ragout detected.', u'/content/early/2016/11/19/088435', [u'Bioinformatics'], [u'UC San Diego;', u'UC Santa Cruz;', u'European Bioinformatics Institute;', u'Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute;', u'Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute;', u'BioTuring']]

A key event in base assembly is the formation of a heterohexameric ring of AAA-ATPases, which is guided by at least four RP assembly chaperones in mammals: PAAF1, p28/gankyrin, p27/PSMD9 and S5b. We determined a cryo-EM structure of the human RP in complex with its assembly chaperone p28 at 4.5-angstrom resolution. The Rpn1-p28-AAA subcomplex in the p28-bound RP is highly dynamic and was resolved to subnanometer resolution in seven states, which recapitulate the conformational landscape of the complex. Surprisingly, the p28-bound AAA ring does not form a channel in the free RP. Instead, it spontaneously samples multiple "open" and "closed" topologies. Our analysis suggests that p28 guides the proteolytic core particle to select certain conformation of the ATPase ring for RP engagement in the last step of the chaperone-mediated proteasome assembly.', u'/content/early/2016/11/19/088492', [u'Biochemistry'], [u'Harvard Medical School;', u'Peking University;', u'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute;', u'Peking University, Harvard Medical School']]

Though viral proteins such as pUL31, pUL34, pUS3 and others are clearly important, these are likely insufficient for efficient fusion with the nuclear membrane. We postulated that host nuclear membrane proteins involved in virus nuclear egress would move from the inner to outer nuclear membranes due to membrane fusion events in primary envelopment and de-envelopment and then diffuse into the endoplasmic reticulum. Membrane fractions were prepared enriched in the nuclear envelope or the endoplasmic reticulum with and without HSV-1 infection and analyzed by mass spectrometry, revealing several vesicle fusion proteins as candidates in the viral nuclear egress pathway. Knockdown of three of these, VAPB, Rab11b, and Rab18, significantly reduced titers of released virus while yielding nuclear accumulation of encapsidated particles. Antibody staining revealed that VAPB visually accumulates in the inner nuclear membrane during HSV-1 infection. VAPB also co-localizes at early time points with the viral pUL34 protein known to be involved in nuclear egress. Most strikingly, VAPB was also observed on HSV-1 virus particles by immunogold labelling electron microscopy. Thus, these data reveal several new host cell vesicle fusion proteins involved in viral nuclear egress.', u'/content/early/2016/11/19/088633', [u'Cell Biology'], [u'University of Edinburgh;', u'University of Glasgow;', u'Stowers Institute for Medical Research;', u'Durham University']]
[u'DIV-1/PolA2 Promotes GLP-1/Notch-Mediated Cellular Events in Caenorhabditis elegans', ['Dong Suk Yoon', 'Dong Seok Cha', 'Myon-Hee Lee'], u'November 19, 2016.', u'Notch signaling is a highly conserved cell signaling system in most multicellular organisms and plays a critical role in animal development. In various tumor cells, Notch signaling is elevated and has been considered as an important target in cancer treatments. In C. elegans, GLP-1 (one of two C. elegans Notch receptors) activity is required for cell fate specification in germline and somatic tissues. In this study, we have identified div-1 gene as a positive regulator for GLP-1/Notch-mediated cellular events. C. elegans div-1 encodes the B subunit of the DNA polymerase alpha-primase complex and is highly expressed in proliferative germ cells. Functional analyses demonstrated that i) DIV-1 is required for the robust proliferation typical of the germline, ii) loss of DIV-1 enhances and suppresses specific phenotypes that are associated with reduced and elevated GLP-1/Notch activity in germline and somatic tissues, and iii) DIV-1 works together with FBF/PUF proteins, downstream regulators of GLP-1/Notch signaling, to promote germline stem cell (GSC) maintenance and germline proliferation. To maintain GSCs and proliferative cell fate, GLP-1/Notch activity must remain above a threshold for proliferation/differentiation decision. Our results propose that DIV-1 may control the level of threshold for GLP-1/Notch-mediated germline proliferation. PolA2, a mammalian homolog of the C. elegans DIV-1, has been emerged as a therapeutic target for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Notably, Notch signaling is altered in approximately one third of NSCLCs. Therefore, the discovery of the DIV-1 effect on GLP-1/Notch-mediated cellular events has implications for our understanding of vertebrate PolA2 protein and its influence on stem cell maintenance and tumorigenesis.', u'/content/early/2016/11/19/088708', [u'Developmental Biology'], [u'Brody School of Medicine at East Carolina University;', u'Woosuk University']]

Microtubule inner proteins (MIPs) are a novel group of Microtubule associated proteins (MAPs) that are localized inside the microtubule lumen. Previously, known MIPS consisted of single proteins or small protein complexes. \nThe tips of flagella possess a region containing only singlet microtubules. We have examined this singlet zone in intact human sperm tails by cryo-electron tomography followed by subvolume averaging and report the presence of a novel structure on the interior of the microtubules that we call: TAILS (Tail Axoneme Intra-Lumenal Spirals). This structure spans the entire singlet zone (several micrometers) and forms a left-handed interrupted helix with 8 nm rise and 12 nm pitch. TAILS is coaxial with the surrounding microtubule helix, which is consistent with identical subunits binding directly to the interior microtubule wall but leaves a gap over the microtubule seam. \nThis is the first higher order structure found inside of a microtubule lumen. We suggest that TAILS may stabilize microtubules, enable rapid swimming, or play a role in controlling the direction in which spermatozoa swim.', u'/content/early/2016/11/19/088476', [u'Cell Biology'], [u'University of Colorado;', u'University of Gothenburg']]
