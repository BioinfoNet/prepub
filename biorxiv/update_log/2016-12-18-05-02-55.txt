[u'Helical reconstruction in RELION', ['Shaoda He', 'Sjors Scheres'], u'December 17, 2016.', u'We describe a new implementation for the reconstruction of helical assemblies in the empirical Bayesian framework of RELION. Our approach calculates optimal linear filters for the 3D reconstruction by embedding helical symmetry operators in Fourier-space, and deals with deviations from perfect helical symmetry through Gaussian-shaped priors on the orientations of individual segments. By incorporating our approach into the standard pipeline for single-particle analysis in RELION, our implementation aims to be easily accessible for non-experienced users. Although our implementation does not solve the problem that grossly incorrect structures can be obtained when the wrong helical symmetry is imposed, we show for four different test cases that it is capable of reconstructing structures to near-atomic resolution.', u'/content/early/2016/12/17/095034', [u'Molecular Biology'], [u'MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology']]
[u'Bacterial communities affected by experimental disturbances to canopy soils of a temperate rainforest', ['Cody R. Dangerfield', 'Nalini M. Nadkarni', 'William J. Brazelton'], u'December 17, 2016.', u'Trees of temperate rainforests host a large biomass of epiphytes, living plants associated with soils formed in the forest canopy. This study provides the first characterization of bacterial communities in canopy soils enabled by high-depth environmental sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. Canopy soil included many of the same major taxonomic groups of Bacteria that are also found in ground soil, but canopy bacterial communities were lower in diversity and contained different species-level operational taxonomic units. A field experiment was conducted to document changes in the bacterial communities of soils associated with epiphytic material that falls to the forest floor. Bacterial diversity and composition of canopy soil was highly similar, but not identical, to adjacent ground soil two years after transfer to the forest floor, indicating that canopy bacteria are almost, but not completely, replaced by ground soil bacteria. Furthermore, soil associated with epiphytic material on branches that were severed from the host tree and suspended in the canopy contained altered bacterial communities that were distinct from those in canopy material moved to the forest floor. Therefore, connection to the living tree is an important factor in the ecology of canopy soil bacteria. These results represent an initial survey of bacterial diversity of the canopy and provide a foundation upon which future studies can more fully investigate the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of these communities.', u'/content/early/2016/12/17/094987', [u'Microbiology'], [u'University of Utah']]

Unlike passive Brownian particles in equilibrium, the velocity and diffusion constant of molecular motors are closely inter-related to each other. In particular, our study makes it clear that the increase of diffusivity with the heat production is a natural outcome of active particles, which is reminiscent of the recent experimental premise that the diffusion of an exothermic enzyme is enhanced by the heat released from its own catalytic turnover. Compared with freely diffusing exothermic enzymes, kinesin-1 whose dynamics is confined on one-dimensional tracks is highly efficient in transforming conformational fluctuations into a locally directed motion, thus displaying a significantly higher enhancement in diffusivity with its turnover rate.

By analysing genetic variation at the mitochondrial and nuclear microsatellite loci for 153 individuals, we identified 3 populations along the Yangtze River, each one connected to a group of admixed ancestry. Each population displayed extremely low genetic diversity, consistent with extremely small effective size (\u2264106 individuals) and census sizes. Habitat degradation and distribution gaps correlated with highly asymmetric gene-flow that was inefficient in maintaining connectivity between populations. Genetic inferences of historical demography revealed that the populations in the Yangtze descended from a small number of founders colonizing the river from the sea during the last Ice Age. The colonization was followed by a rapid population split during the last millennium predating the Chinese industrial revolution.

Human P-glycoprotein (hPGP), coded by MDR1 and belonging to the ABC superfamily, is a membrane efflux transporter that has been identified as an epileptogenic mediator. The ability of hPGP to bind a broad spectrum of substrates could be implicated in the emergence of drug resistance in epilepsy treatment. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in MDR1 could compound the aberrant changes in hPGP activity causing and enhancing drug resistance. Bioinformatics approaches were used to assess the functional impact of 20 missense MDR1 polymorphisms and of these, five MDR1 polymorphisms were prioritised for further study. The structures of the wildtype and five mutant hPGP were modelled using the mouse PGP structure as the template. Docking studies of the wildtype and mutant PGP with four standard FDA-aprroved anti-epileptic drugs were carried out. Our results revealed that the drug binding site with respect to the wildtype protein was constant. However the hPGP mutant proteins displayed a repertoire of binding sites with stronger binding affinities towards the drug. Our studies indicate that specific polymorphisms in MDR1 could drive conformational changes of PGP structure, facilitating novel contacts with drug-substrates and eventually transporting the drug out of the cell, leading to pharmacoresistance.', u'/content/early/2016/12/17/095059', [u'Bioinformatics'], [u'Chettinad Academy of Research and Education, India;', u'Biotechnology - Sri Venkateswara College of Engineering (autonomous), Chennai']]

First, cohesin is responsible for compacting mitotic chromosomes arms, independent of and in addition to its role in sister-chromatid cohesion. Cohesin dependent mitotic chromosome compaction can be fully accounted for through cis-looping of chromatin by loop extrusion. Second, condensin is dispensable for compaction along chromosomal arms and instead plays a specialized role, structuring rDNA and peri-centromeric regions.

Here, a similar ORF-based method is applied to the chloroplast genome from walnut (Accid:KT963008). This revealed, in addition to the \u223c84 protein coding genes, \u223c100 additional putative protein coding genes with homology to RefSeq proteins. Some of these genes have corresponding transcripts in the previously derived transcriptome from twenty different tissues, establishing these as bona fide genes.

This gene has three exons - exon1 is \u223c28kbp away from exon2 and exon3 - and is assembled by trans-splicing. Automated annotation tools are more likely to select an ORF closer to exon2 to complete a possible protein, and are unlikely to properly annotate trans-spliced genes.

[u'Quantifying the relationship between pollinator behavior and plant reproductive isolation', ['Robin Hopkins'], u'December 17, 2016.', u'Pollinator behavior is an important contributor to reproductive isolation in plants. Despite hundreds of years of empirical research, we lack a quantitative framework for evaluating how variation in pollinator behavior causes variation in reproductive isolation in plants. Here I present a model describing how two aspects of pollinator behavior, constancy and preference, lead to reproductive isolation in plants. This model is motivated by two empirical observations: most co-occurring plants vary in frequency over space and time and most plants have multiple pollinators that differ in behavior. These two observations suggest a need to understand how plant frequency and pollinator frequency influence reproductive isolation between co-occurring plants. My model predicts how the proportion of heterospecific matings varies over plant frequencies given pollinator preference and constancy. I find that the shape of this relationship is dependent on the strength of pollinator behavior. Additionally, my model incorporates multiple pollinators with different behaviors to predict the proportion of heterospecific matings across pollinator frequencies. I find that when two pollinators display different strength constancy the total proportion of heterospecific matings is simply the average proportion of heterospecific matings predicted for each pollinator. When pollinators vary in their preference the pollinator with the stronger preference disproportionally contributes to the predicted proportion of total heterospecific matings. I apply this model to examples of pollinator-mediated reproductive isolation in Phlox and in Mimulus to predict relationships between plant and pollinator frequency and reproductive isolation in natural systems.', u'/content/early/2016/12/17/094896', [u'Evolutionary Biology'], [u'Harvard University']]
