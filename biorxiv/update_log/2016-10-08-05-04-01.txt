[u'Collider Scope: How selection bias can induce spurious associations', ['Marcus R Munafo', 'Kate Tilling', 'Amy E Taylor', 'David M Evans', 'George Davey Smith'], u'October 7, 2016.', u'Large-scale cross-sectional and cohort studies have transformed our understanding of the genetic and environmental determinants of health outcomes. However, the representativeness of these samples may be limited - either through selection into studies, or by attrition from studies over time. Here we explore the potential impact of this selection bias on results obtained from these studies. While it is acknowledged that selection bias will have a strong effect on representativeness and prevalence estimates, it is often assumed that it should not have a strong impact on estimates of associations. We argue that because selection can induce collider bias (which occurs when two variables independently influence a third variable, and that variable is conditioned upon), selection can lead to biased estimates of associations. In particular, selection related to phenotypes can bias associations with genetic variants associated with those phenotypes. In simulations, we show that even modest influences on selection into or attrition from a study can generate biased and potentially misleading estimates of both phenotypic and genotypic associations. Our results highlight the value of representative birth cohorts. Having DNA available on most participants at birth at least offers the possibility of investigating the extent to which polygenic scores predict subsequent participation, which in turn would enable sensitivity analyses of the extent to which bias might distort estimates.', u'/content/early/2016/10/07/079707', [], [u'University of Bristol;', u'University of Queensland']]

In the Drosophila embryo Toll is required to establish gene expression domains along the dorsal-ventral axis.  Pathway activation induces degradation of the I\u03baB inhibitor Cactus resulting in a nuclear gradient of the NF\u03baB effector Dorsal. Here we investigate how cactus modulates Toll signals through its effects on the Dorsal gradient and Dorsal target genes. Quantitative analysis using a series of loss and gain-of-function conditions shows that the ventral and lateral aspects of the Dorsal gradient behave differently respective to Cactus fluctuations. Unexpectedly, Cactus favors Dorsal nuclear localization required as response to high Toll signals at the ventral side of the embryo. Furthermore, N-terminal deleted Cactus mimics these effects, indicating that the ability of Cactus to favor Toll stems from mobilization of a free Cactus pool induced by the Calpain A protease.

Bioethanol production from lignocellulosic feedstocks is a complex trait that requires multiple host systems to utilize, detoxify, and metabolize a mixture of sugars and inhibitors present in plant hydrolysates.  Here, we demonstrate an integrated approach to discovering and optimizing host factors that impact fitness of Saccharomyces cerevisiae during fermentation of a Miscanthus x giganteus plant hydrolysate.  We first used high-resolution Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) mapping and systematic Bulk Reciprocal Hemizygosity analysis (bRHA) to discover 17 loci that differentiate hydrolysate tolerance between an industrially related (JAY291) and a laboratory (S288C) strain.  We then used this data to identify a subset of favorable allelic loci that were most amenable for strain engineering.  Guided by this "genetic blueprint", and using a dual-guide Cas9-based method to efficiently perform multi-kilobase locus replacements, we engineered an S288C strain with superior hydrolysate tolerance than JAY291.

The right posterior superior temporal sulcus (rpSTS) is one brain region thought to be key in the recognition of the mental states of others based on body language and facial expression. In the present study, we temporarily disrupted functional activity of the rpSTS by using continuous, theta-burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (cTBS) to test the hypothesis that the rpSTS plays a causal role in emotion recognition from body movements. Participants (N=23) received cTBS of the rpSTS, which was individually localized using fMRI, and a vertex control site. Before and after cTBS, we tested the ability of participants to identify emotions from point-light biological motion stimuli and a non-biological global motion identification task. Results revealed a three-way interaction between cTBS stimulation, stimulation site, and stimulus type, with reduced accuracy of emotion recognition from biological motion following rpSTS stimulation but not following vertex stimulation.

Post-mating, the male ejaculate can selfishly manipulate female physiology leading to a chemical arms race between the sexes. Theory suggests that drift and sexually antagonistic coevolution can cause allopatric populations to evolve different chemical interactions between the sexes, thereby leading to post mating reproductive barriers and speciation. There is, however, little empirical evidence supporting this form of speciation. We tested this theory by creating an experimental evolutionary model of Drosophila melanogaster populations undergoing different levels of interlocus sexual conflict. We found that sexual conflict can cause reproductive isolation in allopatric populations through the co-evolution of chemical (post mating prezygotic) as well as behavioural (pre-mating) interaction between the sexes.

When co-reconstituted on flat supported membranes, these proteins assemble into dynamic chiral vortices whose diameters resemble the cell circumference. These dynamics are due to treadmilling polar FtsZ filaments, supposedly destabilized by the co-polymerizing membrane adaptor FtsA, thus catalysing their turnover. Here we show that FtsA is in fact dispensable and that the phenomenon is an intrinsic property of FtsZ alone when supplemented with a membrane anchor. The emergence of these chiral dynamic patterns is critically dependent on GTP concentration and FtsZ surface densities, in agreement with theoretical predictions. The interplay of membrane tethering, GTP binding, and hydrolysis promotes both, the assembly and the destabilization of FtsZ polymers, leading to the observed treadmilling dynamics. Notably, the vortex chirality is defined by the position of the membrane targeting sequence (mts) and can be inverted when attaching it to the opposite end of FtsZ.

However, the practice of castration raises animal welfare concerns and is undesirable from a production point of view since the elimination of sex hormones reduces feed efficiency and growth. Androstenone is one of the major chemical compounds responsible for boar taint which is characterized by an unpleasant taste and smell from the meat. Primary objectives of this study were to discover new single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within androstenone associated QTL region reported earlier on SSC13 and then utilize a batch of these SNPs for testing the association between three proposed positional candidate genes- solute carrier family 22 (organic anion transporter), member 13 (SLC22A13) and solute carrier family 22 (organic anion transporter), member 14 (SLC22A14) and activin receptor type-2B precursor (ACVR2B) and fat androstenone levels in a population of  922 Norwegian Duroc pigs. \nResults :  In this paper, we discovered several thousands of putative new single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within this QTL region using ~4.92 billion 100bp paired-end illumina whole genome re-sequencing reads of 23 Norwegian Duroc sires. A subset of these SNPs (n=83) in addition to 27 SNPs from the Porcine illumina SNP60 BeadChip  were utilized for genotyping on 922 Norwegian Duroc offspring with androstenone records. Overall 66 new and 15 illumina genotyped SNPs were further used for testing associations with the levels of androstenone in fat tissue. The association study revealed that a total of 5 new SNPs and one illumina SNP of sodium channel, voltage-gated (SCN) genes was significantly affecting the levels of fat androstenone (p<0.05). Further analysis determined a significant (p<0.05) haplotype block of 23-SNP . \nConclusions : Genotyped SNPs in three proposed candidate genes were not explaining any phenotypic variance for androstenone levels but 5 new SNPs and one illumina SNP within another cluster of SCN genes (SCN5A, SCN10A and SCN11A)  were, however, significantly affecting levels of fat androstenone.', u'/content/early/2016/10/07/079665', [u'Genomics'], [u'Department of Animal and Aquacultural Sciences (IHA), Norwegian University of Life Sciences']]

The algorithm employs a collection of enzyme families related to plant specialized metabolism, translated into hidden Markov models, to mine given genome sequences for physically co-localized metabolic enzymes. Our tool accurately identifies previously characterized plant MBCs. An exhaustive search of 31 plant genomes detected 1232 and 5531 putative gene cluster types and candidates, respectively. Clustering analysis of putative MGCs types by species reflected plant phylogeny. Furthermore, enrichment analysis revealed taxa- and species-specific enrichment of certain enzyme families in MGCs.

In natural populations we observed a shallow cline in desiccation tolerance, for which tolerance exhibited a positive association with latitude; the steepness of this cline increased with decreasing culture temperature, demonstrating a significant degree of thermal plasticity. No differences in desiccation tolerance were observed between spring and autumn collections from three mid-to-northern latitude populations, or as a function of experimental evolution to seasonality.  Similarly, water loss rates did not vary significantly among latitudinal, seasonal or experimental evolution populations. However, changes in metabolic rates during prolonged exposure to dry conditions indicate increased tolerance in higher latitude populations.

Analytic combinatorics can be implemented for the optimization of RNA secondary structure prediction algorithms, the derivation of molecular evolution mathematical models, as well as in a number of biotechnological applications, such as biosensors, riboswitches etc. Moreover, it showcases how the integration of biology and mathematics can provide a different viewpoint into the RNA world.", u'/content/early/2016/10/07/079608', [u'Systems Biology'], [u'NEW YORK UNIVERSITY']]
[u'Fitness-valley crossing in subdivided asexual populations', ['Michael R. McLaren'], u'October 7, 2016.', u'Adaptations may require multiple mutations that are beneficial only in combination. To adapt, a lineage must acquire mutations that are individually neutral or deleterious before gaining the beneficial combination, thereby crossing a plateau or valley, respectively, in the mapping from genotype to fitness. Spatial population structure can facilitate plateau and valley crossing by allowing neutral and deleterious lineages to survive longer and produce more beneficial mutants. Here, we analyze adaptation across a two-mutation plateau or valley in an asexual population that is subdivided into discrete subpopulations, or demes, connected by migration. We describe how subdivision alters the dynamics of adaptation from those in an equally sized unstructured population and give a complete quantitative description of these dynamics for the island migration model. Subdivision can significantly decrease the waiting time for the adaptation if demes and migration rates are small enough that single-mutant lineages fix in one or more demes before producing the beneficial double mutant. But, the potential decrease is small in very large populations and may also be limited by the slow spread of the beneficial mutant in extremely subdivided populations. Subdivision has a smaller effect on the probability that the population adapts very quickly than on the mean time to adapt, which has important consequences in some applications, such as the development of cancer. Our results provide a general and intuitive framework for predicting the effects of spatial structure in other models and in natural populations.', u'/content/early/2016/10/07/079624', [u'Evolutionary Biology'], [u'Stanford University, United States']]
[u'Automatic Head Tracking of The Common Marmoset.', ['Hjalmar K Turesson', 'Thamiris Botelho Ribeiro Conceicao', 'Sidarta Ribeiro'], u'October 7, 2016.', u'New technologies for manipulating and recording the nervous system allow us to perform unprecedented experiments. However, the influence of our experimental manipulations on psychological processes must be inferred from their effects on behavior. Today, quantifying behavior has become the bottleneck for large-scale, high throughput, experiments. The method presented here addresses this issue by using deep learning algorithms for video-based animal tracking. Here we describe a reliable automatic method for tracking head position and orientation from simple video recordings of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). This method for measuring marmoset behavior allows for the indirect estimation of gaze within foveal error, and can easily be adapted to a wide variety of similar tasks in biomedical research. In particular, the method has great potential for the simultaneous tracking of multiple marmosets to quantify social behaviors.', u'/content/early/2016/10/07/079566', [u'Animal Behavior and Cognition'], [u'York University;', u'Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte;', u'Brain Institute, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte']]
[u'Genetic Information Relationship Network (GIRN): A Force-directed graphing tool for gene expression analysis', ['Gaelle Rondeau', 'John Welsh'], u'October 7, 2016.', u'We present a web-based tool, Genetic Information Relationship Network (GIRN), for mapping genes to a global protein interaction network for humans, and for further annotating this map with gene ontology, pathway, disease, and user-generated terms. These annotations can be adjusted according to enrichment within a subset of genes. Additionally, drugs that interact with genes in the subset can be added to the graph. The maps are force-directed graphs in which highly connected nodes tend toward the center, and highly interconnected nodes tend toward each other. Icons of different shapes and colors are employed to indicate whether the node represents a protein, a gene, or one of the various types of annotation. Coordinated interaction of genes and functional inference can be identified by visual inspection. Each node in the graph is associated with a menu of links to external data sources. Collectively, these tools provide an efficient portal to gene-associated public data for any group of genes specified by the user.
