[u'Tribe: The collaborative platform for reproducible web-based analysis of gene sets', ['Rene A Zelaya', 'Aaron K Wong', 'Alex T Frase', 'Marylyn D Ritchie', 'Casey S Greene'], u'May 27, 2016.', u"Background:\nThe adoption of new bioinformatics webservers provides biological researchers with new analytical opportunities but also raise workflow challenges. These challenges include sharing collections of genes with collaborators, translating gene identifiers to the most appropriate nomenclature for each server, tracking these collections across multiple analysis tools and webservers, and maintaining effective records of the genes used in each analysis.\n\nDescription:\nIn this paper, we present the Tribe webserver (available at https://tribe.greenelab.com), which addresses these challenges in order to make multi-server workflows seamless and reproducible. This allows users to create analysis pipelines that use their own sets of genes in combinations of specialized data mining webservers and tools while seamlessly maintaining gene set version control. Tribe's web interface facilitates collaborative editing: users can share with collaborators, who can then view, download, and edit these collections. Tribe's fully-featured API allows users to interact with Tribe programmatically if desired. Tribe implements the OAuth 2.0 standard as well as gene identifier mapping, which facilitates its integration into existing servers. Access to Tribe's resources is facilitated by an easy-to-install Python application called tribe-client. We provide Tribe and tribe-client under a permissive open-source license to encourage others to download the source code and set up a local instance or to extend its capabilities.\n\nConclusions:\nThe Tribe webserver addresses challenges that have made reproducible multi-webserver workflows difficult to implement until now. It is open source, has a user-friendly web interface, and provides a means for researchers to perform reproducible gene set based analyses seamlessly across webservers and command line tools.", u'/content/early/2016/05/27/055913', [], [u'University of Pennsylvania;', u'Simons Foundation;', u'Geisinger Health System']]
[u'Transcription factors GAF and HSF act at distinct regulatory steps to modulate stress-induced gene activation', ['Fabiana M Duarte', 'Nicholas J Fuda', 'Dig B Mahat', 'Leighton J Core', 'Michael Guertin', 'John T Lis'], u'May 27, 2016.', u'The coordinated regulation of gene expression at the transcriptional level is fundamental to organismal development and homeostasis. Inducible systems are invaluable when studying transcription because the regulatory process can be triggered instantaneously, allowing the tracking of ordered mechanistic events. Here, we use Precision Run-On sequencing (PRO-seq) to examine the genome-wide Heat Shock (HS) response in Drosophila and the function of two key transcription factors on the immediate transcription activation or repression of all genes regulated by HS. We identify the primary HS response genes and the rate-limiting steps in the transcription cycle that GAGA-Associated Factor (GAF) and HS Factor (HSF) regulate. We demonstrate that GAF acts upstream of promoter-proximally paused RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) formation, likely at the step of chromatin opening, and that GAF-facilitated Pol II pausing is critical for HS activation. In contrast, HSF is dispensable for establishing or maintaining Pol II pausing, but is critical for the release of paused Pol II into the gene body at a subset of highly- activated genes. Additionally, HSF has no detectable role in the rapid HS-repression of thousands of genes.', u'/content/early/2016/05/27/055921', [], [u'Cornell University,;', u'University of California Berkeley;', u'Cornell University;', u'University of Connecticut;', u'University of Virginia']]
[u'The coevolutionary romance of social learning and parasitic behavior', ['Richard McElreath'], u'May 27, 2016.', u"Once an animal begins to acquire behavior by social learning, it may be seduced by parasitic parasitic, behavior that reduces the animal's fitness and thereby increases its own spread. However, the animal's psychology will coevolve, potentially limiting the influence and spread of parasitic behavior. I revisit prominent models of the evolution of social learning and introduce the possibility of parasitic behavior. First, I explore a courtship between primitive social learning and parasitic behavior. Parasitic behavior can spread, but selection on the host then reduces social learning and limits its importance. Both parties are frustrated. In the second part, I study a reconciliation dynamic in which social learning becomes strategic about who it partners with. In this model, parasitic behavior can become prevalent and substantially reduce host fitness. However, it may also evolve to be mutualistic and raise the mean fitness of the host organism. When this occurs, natural selection may favor psychological susceptibility to parasitic behavior. Both social learning and socially learned behavior can enjoy a happy ending.", u'/content/early/2016/05/27/055889', [], [u'MPI for Evolutionary Anthropology']]

In this investigation, we tackle this issue by showing how a multi-scale perspective can yield  new insights. With the help of temperature-dependent statistical potentials, we  analyzed some amino acid interactions at the molecular level, which are suggested to be relevant for the enhancement of thermal resistance. We then investigated the thermal stability at the protein level by quantifying its modification upon amino acid substitutions. Finally, a large scale analysis of protein stability - at the structurome level - contributed to the clarification of the relation between stability and  natural evolution, thereby  showing that the mutational profile of thermostable and mesostable proteins differ.

The computational\ncost increases exponentially with respect to the number of modifiable amino acids and\nlinearly with respect to the number of potential PTM types at each amino acid. The\nproblem becomes intractable very quickly if we want to enumerate all possible modi-\nfication patterns. Existing tools (e.g., MS-Alignment, ProteinProspector, and MODa)\navoid enumerating modification patterns in database search by using an alignment-\nbased approach to localize and characterize modified amino acids. This approach avoids\nenumerating all possible modification patterns in a database search. However, due to\nthe large search space and PTM localization issue, the sensitivity of these tools is low.\n\nThis paper proposes a novel method named PIPI to achieve PTM-invariant peptide\nidentification. PIPI first codes peptide sequences into Boolean vectors and converts\nexperimental spectra into real-valued vectors. Then, it finds the top 10 peptide-coded\nvectors for each spectrum-coded vector. After that, PIPI uses a dynamic program-\nming algorithm to localize and characterize modified amino acids. Simulations and\nreal data experiments have shown that PIPI outperforms existing tools by identifying\nmore peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) and reporting fewer false positives.

In addition, gene promoters are largely divergent and initiate transcription of reverse-oriented promoter upstream transcripts (PROMPTs). Although PROMPTs are commonly terminated early, influenced by polyadenylation sites, promoters often cluster so that the divergent activity of one might impact another. Here, we find that the distance between promoters strongly correlates with the expression, stability and length of their associated PROMPTs. Adjacent promoters driving divergent mRNA transcription support PROMPT formation, but due to polyadenylation site constraints, these transcripts tend to spread into the neighboring mRNA on the same strand. This mechanism to derive new alternative mRNA transcription start sites (TSSs) is also evident at closely spaced promoters supporting convergent mRNA transcription.

The very large sample size of the UK Biobank is ideal for detecting selection using population differentiation, and enables an analysis of UK population structure at fine resolution.

In the receiving cell, signaling results in cleavage of the Notch intracellular domain and its import into the nucleus, where it binds Suppressor of Hairless [Su(H)] to promote gene expression in conjunction with contextual cues in the surrounding DNA sequence. To investigate the nature of this contextual logic, we identify 1344 Su(H)-site containing regulatory belts that are conserved across the Drosophila genus. Each Su(H)-type regulatory belt (SUH-RB) is a 0.6\u20131.0 kb chain of conservation peaks consistent with a transcriptional enhancer or core promoter. These regulatory belts contain one or more canonical binding sites for Su(H) along with ~15\u201330 other binding sites. SUH-RBs are densely clustered in certain chromosomal regions such as the E(spl)-complex, the Wnt gene complex, and genes encoding Notch receptor ligands (Delta and Serrate). SUH-RBs overlap most known Su(H)/Notch-target enhancers and others, including non-embryonic enhancers that are not identified by embryonic ChIP-seq peaks. Thus, SUH-RBs overcome the stage-specific nature of embryonic ChIP-seq peaks and suggest a pervasive role for contextual tissue-specific pioneer and/or enhancer-licensing factors. SUH-RBs also delineate false positive ChIP-seq peaks, which do not overlap SUH-RBs, are missing even the weakest Su(H)-binding sequences, and have the shortest ChIP peak widths.
