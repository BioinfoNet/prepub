In this study, we extend the potential of metatranscriptomics to probe active virus infections and virus-host relationships in marine systems. Polyadenylation-selected RNA-seq data were examined from microbial communities in two productive marine environments: a brown tide bloom event dominated by Aureococcus anophagefferens in Quantuck Bay, NY, and a diatom-dominated plankton community in Narragansett Bay, RI. Active infections by diverse giant viruses (NCLDVs) of algal and non-algal hosts were found at both sites. Ongoing infections of  A. anophagefferens by a known Mimiviridae (AaV) were observed during both the peak and decline of the bloom. Bloom decline was also accompanied by increased activity for viruses other than AaV, including (+) ssRNA viruses. In Narragansett Bay, increased temporal resolution revealed active NCLDVs with both "boom-and-bust" as well as "steady-state infection"-like ecologies.  Statistical co-occurrence examinations of the dsDNA, ssRNA and dsRNA markers within the data revealed a broad spectrum of statistically strong and significant virus-host relationships that included both known as well as novel interactions.

Embryonic stem cell (ESC) derived DA neurons have the potential to aid in the study of disease mechanisms, drug discovery, and possibly cell replacement therapies. DA neurons can be generated from ESCs in vitro, but the subtypes of ESC-derived DA neurons have not been investigated in detail despite the diversity of DA neurons observed in vivo. Due to cell culture heterogeneity, sampling methods applied to ESC-derived cultures can be ambiguous and potentially biased. Therefore, we developed a quantification method to capture the depth of DA neuron production in vitro by estimating the error associated with systematic random sampling. Using this method, we quantified calbindin+ and calretinin+ subtypes of DA neurons generated from mouse ESCs. We found a higher production of the calbindin+ subtype (11-27%) compared to the calretinin+ subtype (2-13%) of DA neurons; in addition, DA neurons expressing neither subtype marker were also generated. We then examined whether exogenous sonic hedgehog (SHH) and fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) affected subtype generation. Our results demonstrate that exogenous SHH and FGF8 did not alter DA neuron subtype generation in vitro. These findings suggest that a deeper understanding DA neuron derivation inclusive of mechanisms that govern the in vitro subtype specification of ESC-derived DA neurons is required.', u'/content/early/2016/12/13/093419', [u'Neuroscience'], [u'Tufts University;', u'University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center;', u'Departments of Orthopedics and Surgery at Rhode Island Hospital and The Warren Alpert Medical School;', u'Department of Molecular Biology, Cell Biology, and Biochemistry, Brown University;', u'National Institute of Standards and Technology;', u'Department of Molecular Pharmacology, Physiology, and Biotechnology, Brown University;', u'Amgen']]

Here we investigated progression from the ES cell ground state in adherent culture. We utilised down-regulation of Rex1::GFPd2 to track loss of ES cell identity. We found that cells that have newly down-regulated this reporter have acquired competence for germline induction. They can also be efficiently specified for different somatic lineages, responding more rapidly than na\xefve cells to inductive cues. Nodal is a candidate autocrine regulator of pluripotency. Abrogation of Nodal signalling did not substantially alter kinetics of exit from the ES cell state, but accelerated subsequent adoption of neural fate at the expense of other lineages. This effect was evident if Nodal was inhibited prior to extinction of ES cell identity.

To test these predictions, we studied the fate of mutator bacteria expanding their range for 1650 generations on agar plates. In agreement with theory, we find that growth abilities of strains with a high mutation rate (HMR lines) decreased significantly over time, unlike strains with a lower mutation rate (LMR lines) that present 3-4 times fewer mutations. Estimation of the distribution of fitness effect (DFE) under a spatially explicit model reveals a mean negative effect for new mutations (-0.38%), but it suggests that both advantageous and deleterious mutations have accumulated during the experiment. Furthermore, we show that the fitness of HMR lines measured in different environments has decreased relative to the ancestor strain, whereas that of LMR lines remained unchanged. Our results thus suggest that successful expanding species are affected by deleterious mutations that accumulate during the expansion process, leading to a drastic impairment of their evolutionary potential.', u'/content/early/2016/12/13/093658', [u'Evolutionary Biology'], [u'University of Bern;', u'University of Berne;', u'Inserm;', u'ETHZ']]

Here we describe a high-performance, low-cost, open hardware pressure ejection system (Openspritzer), which can be constructed from off the shelf components. When connected to a standard micro-pipette via suitable pneumatic tubing, the device is capable of delivering minute doses of reagents to a wide range of biological and chemical systems. In this work, we characterise the performance of the device and compare it to a popular commercial system using two-photon fluorescence microscopy. We found that Openspritzer provides the same level of control over delivered reagent dose as the commercial system. Next, we demonstrate the utility of Openspritzer in a series of standard neurobiological applications. First, we used Openspritzer to deliver precise amounts of the neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA to hippocampal neurons to elicit time- and dose-precise excitatory and inhibitory responses, respectively. Second, we used Openspritzer to deliver infectious viral and bacterial agents to living tissue. Viral transfection of hippocampal interneurons with channelrhodopsin allowed for the optogenetic manipulation of hippocampal circuitry with light. Finally, we successfully used Openspritzer to infect organotypic hippocampal slice cultures with fluorescent Mycobacterium bovis bacilli.

A major constraint in breeding resistant cultivars is the lack of mapping information of resistance (R) genes and their introgression into adapted germplasm. A considerable number of R genes have been described in barley to P. striiformis f. sp. hordei, but only a few loci have been mapped. Previously, Chen and Line (1999) reported two recessive seedling resistance loci in the Ethiopian landrace HOR 1428. In this study, we map two loci that confer resistance to P. striiformis f. sp. hordei in HOR 1428, which are located on chromosomes 3H and 5H. Both loci act as additive effect QTLs, each explaining approximately 20% of the phenotypic variation. We backcrossed HOR 1428\nto the cv. Manchuria and selected based on markers flanking the RpsHOR128-5H locus. Saturation of the RpsHOR1428-5H locus with markers in the region found KASP marker K_1_0292 in complete coupling with resistance to P. striiformis f. sp. hordei and was designated Rps9.

We used the "triple-flash" illusion: Occasional perception of three flashes when only two spatially-coincident veridical ones are presented, separated by ~100 ms. The illusion was proposed to result from superposition of two hypothetical oscillatory impulse response functions (IRF) generated in response to each flash (Bowen, 1989). In Experiment 1, we varied stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) and validated Bowen\'s theory: the optimal SOA for illusion to occur was correlated, across subjects, with the subject-specific IRF period.

[u'Induced defenses alter the strength and direction of natural selection on reproductive traits in common milkweed', ['Ken A. Thompson', 'Kaitlin A Cory', 'Marc T.J. Johnson'], u'December 13, 2016.', u'Evolutionary biologists have long sought to understand the ecological processes that generate plant reproductive diversity. Recent evidence indicates that constitutive antiherbivore defenses can alter natural selection on reproductive traits, but it is unclear whether induced defenses will have the same effect and whether reduced foliar damage in defended plants is the cause of this pattern. In a factorial field experiment using common milkweed, Asclepias syriaca, we induced plant defenses using jasmonic acid (JA) and imposed foliar damage using scissors. We found that JA-induced plants experienced selection for more inflorescences that were smaller in size (fewer flowers), while control plants only experienced a trend toward selection for larger inflorescences (more flowers); all effects were independent of foliar damage. Our results demonstrate that induced defenses can alter both the strength and direction of selection on reproductive traits, and suggest that antiherbivore defenses may promote the evolution of plant reproductive diversity.', u'/content/early/2016/12/13/093609', [u'Evolutionary Biology'], [u'University of Toronto;', u'University of Toronto Mississauga;', u'University of Toronto at Mississauga']]
[u'http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/079087 CONTINUATION: Evaluation of adaptive somatic models in a gold standard whole genome somatic dataset', ['Fabien Campagne'], u'December 13, 2016.', u'In http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/079087, we  presented adaptive models for calling somatic mutations in high-throughput sequencing data. These models were developed by training deep neural networks with semi-simulated data. In this continuation, I evaluate how such models can predict known somatic mutations in a real dataset. To address this question, I tested the approach using samples from the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and the previously published ground-truth mutations (GoldSet). This evaluation revealed that training models with semi-simulation does produce models that exhibit strong performance in real datasets. I found a linear relationship between the performance observed on a semi-simulated validation set and independent ground-truth in the gold set (r^2=0.952, P<2-16). I also found that semi-simulation can be used to pre-train models before continuing training with true labels and that this pre-training improves model performance substantially on the real dataset compared to training models only with the real dataset. The best model pre-trained with semi-simulation achieved an AUC of 0.969 [0.957-0.982] (95% confidence interval)  compared to  0.911 [0.890-0.932] when training with real labels only. These data demonstrate that semi-simulation can be a very effective approach to training filtering and ranking probabilistic models.', u'/content/early/2016/12/13/093534', [u'Bioinformatics'], [u'Weill Medical College of Cornell University']]
[u'Ancient individuals from the North American Northwest Coast reveal 10,000 years of regional genetic continuity', ['John Lindo', 'Alessandro Achilli', 'Ugo Perego', 'David Archer', 'Cristina Valdiosera', 'Barbara Petzelt', 'Joycelynn Mitchell', 'Rosita Worl', 'E. James Dixon', 'Terence Fifield', 'Morten Rasmussen', 'Eske Willerslev', 'Jerome Cybulski', 'Brian Kemp', 'Michael DeGiorgio', 'Ripan S. Malhi'], u'December 13, 2016.', u'Recent genome-wide studies of both ancient and modern indigenous people of the Americas have shed light on the demographic processes involved during the first peopling. The Pacific northwest coast proves an intriguing focus for these studies due to its association with coastal migration models and genetic ancestral patterns that are difficult to reconcile with modern DNA alone. Here we report the genome-wide sequence of an ancient individual known as "Shuk\xe1 K\xe1a" ("Man Ahead of Us") recovered from the On Your Knees Cave (OYKC) in southeastern Alaska (archaeological site 49-PET-408). The human remains date to approximately 10,300 cal years before present (BP). We also analyze low coverage genomes of three more recent individuals from the nearby coast of British Columbia dating from approximately 6075 to 1750 cal years BP. From the resulting time series of genetic data, we show that the Pacific Northwest Coast exhibits genetic continuity for at least the past 10,300 cal BP. We also infer that population structure existed in the late Pleistocene of North America with Shuk\xe1 K\xe1a on a different ancestral line compared to other North American individuals (i.e., Anzick-1 and Kennewick Man) from the late Pleistocene or early Holocene. Despite regional shifts in mitochondrial DNA haplogroups we conclude from individuals sampled through time that people of the northern Northwest Coast belong to an early genetic lineage that may stem from a late Pleistocene coastal migration into the Americas.', u'/content/early/2016/12/13/093468', [u'Genomics'], [u'University of Chicago;', u'University of Pavia;', u'3589 Fifth Avenue East, Prince Rupert, B.C.;', u'La Trobe University;', u'Metlakatla Treaty Office;', u'Sealaska Heritage Institute;', u'University of New Mexico;', u'University of Alaska Southeast;', u'Stanford University;', u'Centre for GeoGenetics, Natural History Museum of Denmark;', u'Canadian Museum of History;', u'University of Oklahoma;', u'Pennsylvania State University;', u'University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana']]
