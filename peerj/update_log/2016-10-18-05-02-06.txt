[u'A supertree pipeline for summarizing phylogenetic and taxonomic information for millions of species', ['Benjamin D Redelings', 'Mark T Holder'], u'2016-10-18', u'We present a new supertree method that enables rapid estimation of a summary tree on the scale of millions of leaves. This supertree method summarizes a collection of input phylogenies and an input taxonomy. We introduce formal goals and criteria for such a supertree to satisfy in order to transparently and justifiably represent the input trees. In addition to producing a supertree, our method computes annotations that describe which grouping in the input trees support and conflict with each group in the supertree.\nWe compare our supertree construction method to a previously published supertree construction method by assessing their performance on input trees used to construct the Open Tree of Life version 4, and find that our method increases the number of displayed input splits from 35,518 to 39,639 and decreases the number of conflicting input splits from 2,760 to 1,357. The new supertree method also improves on the previous supertree construction method in that it produces no unsupported branches and avoids unnecessary polytomies.\nThis pipeline is currently used by the Open Tree of Life project to produce all of the versions of project\'s "synthetic tree" starting at version 5. This software pipeline is called "propinquity". It relies heavily on "otcetera" - a set of C++ tools to perform most of the steps of the pipeline. All of the components are free software and are available on GitHub.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2538/', ['Bioinformatics', 'Computational Biology', 'Evolutionary Studies', 'Taxonomy'], [u'Department of Biology, Duke University', u'Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Kansas', u'Biodiversity Institute, University of Kansas', u'Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies']]

FARO 2.0 is a tool for application and desktop virtualization with a strong focus towards user experience (UX), providing trained as well as untrained users a collection of centralized services that can be seamlessly used on their client through a remote desktop protocol. FARO 2.0 is a JavaFX application whose graphical user interface (GUI) and whose main logics has been implemented through the well- known Web technologies (HTML5, CSS3, Javascript) for a easier maintainability and customizability, taking full advantage of the WebView component. Its framework has been deployed both as general purpose GUI for remote user access to ENEAGRID resources and as specialized application or workflow oriented GUI. They are applied in a set of applicative domains, ranging from material science to technologies for energy and industry, environmental modeling and nuclear fusion.

[u'MiCADO \u2013 Towards a microservice-based cloud application-level dynamic orchestrator', ['Hannu Visti', 'Tamas Kiss', 'Gabor Terstyanszky', 'Gregoire Gesmier', 'Stephen Winter'], u'2016-10-17', u'In order to satisfy end-user requirements, many scientific and commercial applications require access to dynamically adjustable infrastructure resources. Cloud computing has the potential to provide these dynamic capabilities. However, utilising these capabilities from application code is not trivial and requires application developers to understand low-level technical details of clouds. This paper investigates how a generic framework can be developed that supports the dynamic orchestration of cloud applications both at deployment and at run-time. The advantages and challenges of designing such framework based on microservices is analysed, and a generic framework, called MiCADO \u2013 (Microservices-based Cloud Application-level Dynamic Orchestrator) is proposed. A first prototype implementation of MiCADO to support data intensive commercial web applications is also presented.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2536/', ['Distributed and Parallel Computing', 'Scientific Computing and Simulation'], [u'Centre for Parallel Computing, University of Westminster']]
[u'Gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus) as a new experimental model of obesity induced by diet', ['Luciana L A Ventura', 'Nathalia C L Fortes', 'Helton C Santiago', 'Marcelo Vidigal Caliari', 'Maria A Gomes', 'Dirce R Oliveira'], u'2016-10-17', u'Background. Currently, the number of obese people in the world has reached alarming proportions. During the expansion of adipose tissue, a number of functions such as activation and release of cytokines and hormones may be affected. This causes the body to take a pro-inflammatory pattern, which may affect the proper functioning of many tissues. Thus, studying the mechanisms by which obesity induces physiological disorders is necessary, and may be facilitated by the use of animal models, in particular rodents. We sought to investigate whether the gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus) would be a good experimental model for the study of obesity and metabolic changes resulting from a diet rich in fats and sugars. Methods. 14 gerbils were divided according to weight into two experimental groups and received a a standard diet with 4,15kcal/g (CT; n = 7) or a diet rich in simple carbohydrates and fats with 5,86kcal/g (OB, n = 7) for 11 weeks. The animals had free access to water and food. The weight of each animal and food consumption of each cage were measured weekly and at the end of the experiment, blood, adipose tissue and liver were collected. The following parameters were determined: cholesterol (COL), triglycerides (TGL) and glycemia (GLI) in the plasma; cytokines (IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-\u03b1) and hormones (adiponectin and leptin) in adipose tissue; activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), extraction and differentiation of fat in the liver and liver histology. Results. The consumption of a diet rich in simple fats and carbohydrates led to an increase of total body weight, relative weights of liver and adipose tissue, glucose and triglycerides levels, and TNF-\u03b1 concentration in adipose tissue. Animals of this group also showed a significant increase of total fat, cholesterol and triglyceride content in the liver, contributing to higher intensity of hepatic steatosis. On the other hand, depletion in the enzyme activity of SOD and CAT in the liver, as well as reduction of IL-10 and adiponectin levels were found in adipose tissue of these animals. Conclusion. Diet consumption consisting of an excess in saturated fat and simple carbohydrates establish the gerbil as an experimental model for the study of obesity and metabolic and liver abnormalities resulting from this disease.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2535/', ['Diabetes and Endocrinology', 'Nutrition'], [u'Dept.
