[u'Do current definitions and methods promote the general application of functional traits and functional diversity', ['Linhai Zhu', 'Jonathan S Lefcheck', 'Bojie Fu'], u'2016-12-10', u'The use of functional traits has increased exponentially in ecology, particularly in attempting to explain ecosystem functioning. This popularity has led to many proposed definitions of functional traits, which in turn has informed recommendations about how to gather, summarize, and analyze trait data. In this paper, we revisit the definition of the functional trait from the perspective of physiological, community and ecosystem ecologists, and reason towards a broad, unrestrictive, and applicable definition. We then demonstrate how a popular technique, ordination, which is used to collapse multivariate trait data into orthogonal axes, undermines this definition and the primary benefit of functional traits. We outline the conceptual pitfalls associated with ordination, and make specific suggestions about alternative methods that progress functional traits as generalizable proxies for how organisms affect ecosystem processes. We hope these suggestions will improve our ability to move towards an ecological synthesis using a trait-based approach.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2631/', ['Biodiversity', 'Ecology', 'Plant Science'], [u'Chinese Academy of Sciences, State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology', u'Department of Biological Sciences, Virginia Institute of Marine Science, The College of William & Mary']]
[u'Speeding-up mutation testing via data compression and state infection', ['Qianqian Zhu', 'Annibale Panichella', 'Andy Zaidman'], u'2016-12-10', u'Mutation testing is widely considered as a high-end test criterion due to the vast number of mutants it generates. Although many efforts have been made to reduce the computational cost of mutation testing, its scalability issue remains in practice. In this paper, we introduce a novel method to speed up mutation testing based on state infection information. In addition to filtering out uninfected test executions, we further select a subset of mutants and a subset of test cases to run leveraging data-compression techniques. In particular, we adopt Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) to group similar mutants together and then select test cases to cover these mutants. To evaluate our method, we conducted an experimental study on six open source Java projects. We used EvoSuite to automatically generate test cases and to collect mutation data. The initial results show that our method can reduce the execution time by 83.93% with only 0.257% loss in precision.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2632/', ['Software Engineering'], [u'Software Engineering Research Group, Delft University of Technology', u'Software Testing, Security Testing, Empirical Software Engineering, SBSE, University of Luxembourg']]

[u'Spatiotemporal succession of ammonia-oxidizing archaea abundance and composition in a created riparian wetland', ['Yu Su', 'Guibing Zhu', 'Baoling Wang', 'Yu Wang', 'Linjie Zhuang', 'Weidong Wang'], u'2016-12-09', u"Cascaded performance and compartments of constructed wetlands may harbor the internal eco-environmental gradients and further differentiate the niche and community structure of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA). Here, we used quantitative PCR and 454 pyrosequencing of AOA amoA gene to investigate the abundance, diversity, composition, and driving factors of sedimentary AOA community in a created riparian wetland---Shijiuyang constructed wetland (SJY-CW) in China. Results showed that the heterogeneous wetland with serial-connected combinations of pretreatment pond, plant-bed/ditch system, and post-treatment pond as well as the third through fifth year succession (2011--2013, corresponding to the third through fifth year of actual operation after the initial two-year trial operation) had exerted significant spatiotemporal niche selection effects on AOA abundance and composition. AOA abundance in the pre- and post-treatment ponds was almost invariant in 2011--2012 and decreased in 2013, while the abundance in the plant-bed/ditch system decreased gradually with the succession of SJY-CW. The AOA abundance ended up with one order of magnitude lower and tended to be consistent in the whole wetland. In contrast to abundance, the temporal niche differentiation of AOA diversity was insignificant. Nonetheless, a rough decrease trend was detected for the average community richness index Chao1 and diversity index Shannon H' in 2011--2013. Community structure analysis showed that Nitrososphaera was dominant genus, while Nitrosopumilus cluster and Nitrososphaera sister cluster increased with the succession of SJY-CW. Hierarchical clustering analysis and redundancy analysis both verified the horizontal shifts of AOA communities and these shifts inclined to occur in the most heterogeneous plant-bed/ditch system. Operational duration of the wetland which comprehensively reflected the wetland hydrology, water quality, and associated functions became the key factor driving the AOA abundance and community shift in SJY-CW sediments. In a nutshell, with the third through fifth year succession of wetland, the sedimentary ammonia-oxidizing archaea tended to be characterized by temporally decreased and spatially consistent abundance, while spatially variable and temporally decreased richness and diversity; regarding the AOA community structure, temporally from local species and relatively uniform distribution to mixing with allochthonous species and highly diversified distribution, while spatially occurring significant horizontal shifts of AOA amoA genes. These results showed the considerable if not significant niche selection effect of AOA abundance, diversity, and community structure with the operation of SJY-CW, and this will have some implications on the microbial ecology of archaeal ammonia-oxidization in a man-made wetland ecosystem.", u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2629/', ['Biodiversity', 'Ecology', 'Microbiology'], [u'Key Laboratory of Drinking Water Science and Technology, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences', u'University of Chinese Academy of Sciences', u'College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Donghua University']]
