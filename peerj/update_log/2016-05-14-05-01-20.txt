It is currently assessed as near threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. In this study we identified 9 microsatellite loci through next generation sequencing (454 pyrosequencing) using 29 samples from the western Atlantic. The genetic diversity of these loci was assessed and revealed a total of 48 alleles ranging from 3 to 7 alleles per locus (average of 5.3 alleles). Cross-species amplification was assessed in three other species: Carcharhinus longimanus, C. acronotus and Alopias superciliosus. Given the potential applicability of genetic markers for biological conservation, these data may contribute to the population assessment of this and other species of sharks worldwide.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2042/', ['Aquaculture, Fisheries and Fish Science', 'Conservation Biology', 'Genetics', 'Marine Biology', 'Zoology'], [u'Laborat\xf3rio de Biologia e Gen\xe9tica de Peixes, Universidade Estadual Paulista', u'Laborat\xf3rio de Gen\xe9tica Pesqueira e Conserva\xe7\xe3o, Marine Sciences Institute, Universidade Federal de S\xe3o Paulo', u'Lake Nona Campus, Valencia College', u'Florida Museum of Natural History, Florida Program for Shark Research, University of Florida', u'IPMA, Portuguese Institute for the Ocean and Atmosphere']]
