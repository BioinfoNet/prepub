[u'Interactive web-based visualization of phylogenetic trees using Phylogeny.IO', ['Nikola Jovanovic', 'Alexander S Mikheyev'], u'2016-11-04', u'Traditional static publication formats make visualization, exploration and sharing of massive phylogenetic trees difficult. Web-based technologies, such as the Data Driven Document (D3) JavaScript library, exist to overcome such challenges by allowing interactive display of complex data sets. We here we an open-source web-based application that applies the power of D3 to the visualization of phylogenetic trees. Phylogeny.IO (http://phyloeny.io) displays trees together with a range of static (e.g., such as shapes and colors) and dynamic (e.g., pop-up text and images) annotations. Annotated trees can be shared as IFrame HTML objects easily embeddable in any web page.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2579/', ['Evolutionary Studies'], [u'Digital Reframe', u'Ecology and Evolution Unit, Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University']]
[u'Introduction to special series on endocrine disruption: Chemical testing, risk assessment approaches and implications', ['Annegaaike Leopold', 'Katherine Coady'], u'2016-11-04', u'This special series of six papers (this introductory paper and 5 other papers)  is about the Focused Topic Meeting on Endocrine Disruption Chemical Testing; Risk Assessment Approaches and Implications (4 \u2013 6 February, 2014, Raleigh, North Carolina). The workshop was composed of five sessions that each dealt with a specific topic. Broadly speaking the following themes were addressed: a) the status of the USEPA Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program, b) how data from both EDSP-directed testing and other sources may be interpreted and applied in regulatory settings and c) approaches for moving beyond estrogen, androgen and thyroid pathways to address current challenges and expanding future approaches to EDC testing. The series of publications summarizes the knowledge presented and discussed at the Focused Topic Meeting and organizes the information by session. Where relevant, the summaries are enhanced beyond the original ideas of the presentations during the meeting. It is the intention of the Steering Committee that these publications will act not only as a record of the proceedings of the meeting, but also as a valuable resource.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2578/', ['Ecology', 'Environmental Sciences', 'Genomics', 'Toxicology'], [u'Calidris environment bv', u'The Dow Chemical Company']]
