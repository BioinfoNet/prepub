[u'Impact of the catchment land use on some factors of lakes trophic status: a GIS approach', ['Lukasz  Slugocki', 'Robert Czerniawski'], u'2016-07-01', u'Background. Artificial enrichment of lakes has posed serious management problems for water supply. In results many European lakes had already undergone significant eutrophication. It seems that a good tool to determine the influence of catchment use on the trophic changes in lakes is Geographic Information System (GIS) and its databases.\nMethods. The study covered 31 stratified lakes located in northwestern Poland. These lakes were chosen on account of their considerable recreation value and economic importance. The parameters chosen as dependent variables were Secchi depth and electrical conductivity. Local catchments and network catchment of studied lakes as independent variables were prepared using QGIS Wien (2.8.7). The land use variables were prepared with Corine Land Cover, 2006 (CLC2006).\nResults. According to Carlson index the studied lakes ranged from mesotrophic to eutrophic. Both dependent variables Secchi depth and conductivity values were significantly correlated with independent land use variables (P < 0.05).\nDiscussion. Our survey revealed that percentage use of the catchment (developed in the Geographic Information System) can be a useful tool in the assessment of the lakes risks. With the GIS tools we also confirmed a significant impact of land use on changes transparency and conductivity values in North West lakes in Poland.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2203/', ['Data Science', 'Spatial and Geographic Information Systems'], [u'Faculty of Biology, Szczecin University']]

Improvements in sequencing technology constantly provide longer reads, such that longer fragment length, higher molecular weight, and overall \u201cgenome-quality\u201d DNA (gDNA) will be desirable. Ideally, biorepositories should publish numerical scale measurements of DNA quality useful to the user community. However, the most widely used technique to evaluate DNA quality, the classic agarose gel, has yet to be quantified. Here we propose a simple and economical method using open source image analysis software to make gDNA gel images quantifiable, and propose percentage of gDNA \u201cgreater than X kb\u201d as a standard of comparison, where X is a band from any widely used DNA ladder with desirably large band sizes. We employ two metadata standards (\u201cDNA Threshold\u201d and \u201cPercent above Threshold\u201d) introduced as part of the Global Genome Biodiversity Network (GGBN) Darwin Core extension. We illustrate the method using the traditionally used HindIII ladder and the 9,416 base-pair (bp) band as a standard. We also present data, for two taxa, a vertebrate (fish) and an invertebrate (crab), on how gDNA quality varies with seven tissue preservation methods, time since death, preservation method (i.e. buffers vs. cold temperatures), and storage temperature of various buffers over time.

[u'Learning protein folding and evolution with a snake puzzle', ['Gonzalo S Nido', 'Ludovica Bachschmid-Romano', 'Ugo Bastolla', 'Alberto Pascual-Garcia'], u'2016-07-01', u'We propose here a working unit for teaching basic concepts of protein folding and evolution centred around the example of a wooden snake puzzle, strikingly similar to toy models widely used in the literature of protein folding. In our experience, developed at a Master course at the Universidad Aut\xf3noma de Madrid (Spain), the concreteness of this example helps to overcome difficulties caused by the interdisciplinary nature of this field and its high level of abstraction, in particular for students coming from traditional disciplines. The puzzle will allow us discussing a simple algorithm for finding folded solutions, through which we will introduce the concept of the configuration space and the contact matrix representation. This is a central tool for comparing protein structures, for studying simple models of protein energetics, and even for a qualitative discussion of folding kinetics, through the concept of the Contact Overlap. It also allows a simple representation of misfolded conformations and their free energy. These concepts, in particular protein structure comparison and the stability of the native state with respect to unfolded and misfolded conformations, will motivate evolutionary questions. We address these questions by simulating a structurally constrained model of protein evolution, again modelled on the snake puzzle. In this way, we can discuss the analogy between evolutionary concepts and statistical mechanics that facilitates the understanding of both concepts. The proposed examples and literature are accessible, and we provide supplementary material to reproduce the numerical experiments. We also suggest possible directions to expand the unit.

Although these techniques are readily used by ecologists to visualize and explain differences between study sites, they could theoretically be employed to differentiate organisms within an experimental framework while simultaneously identifying response variables that drive documented experimental differences.\nMethods: A meta-analysis employing various MSA was conducted to re-analyze data from two studies that sought to understand the response of the common, Indo-Pacific reef coral Seriatopora hystrix to temperature changes.\nResults: Gene expression and physiological data partitioned experimental specimens by time of sampling, treatment temperature, and site of origin upon employing MSA.\nDiscussion: These findings 1) signify that S. hystrix and its dinoflagellate endosymbionts display physiological and molecular signatures that are characteristic of sampling time, site of colony origin, and/or temperature regime and 2) promote the utility of MSA for documenting biologically meaningful shifts in the physiological and/or sub-cellular response of marine invertebrates exposed to environmental change.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2200/', ['Environmental Sciences', 'Genomics', 'Marine Biology', 'Molecular Biology', 'Statistics'], [u'Living Oceans Foundation', u'National Museum of Marine Biology and Aquarium', u'Taiwan Coral Research Center', u'Department of Marine Biotechnology and Resources, National        Sun Yat-Sen University', u'Graduate Institute of Marine Biotechnology, National Dong Hwa University']]
[u'Receptor flexibility in molecular cross-docking', ['Lucia Sessa', 'Luigi Di BIasi', 'Rosaura Parisi', 'Simona Concilio', 'Stefano Piotto'], u'2016-07-01', u'Motivation\n\nMolecular docking is an efficient method to predict the conformations adopted by the ligand within the target binding site. Usually, standard docking protocol involves only one structure to represent the receptor, overlooking the changes in the binding pocket geometry induced by ligand binding. In our previous work, we observed that different conformations of the same target show different volume and shape of the internal cavities (Sessa et al., 2016). Different ligands may stabilize different receptor conformations with different internal cavities. Consequently, the crystallographic data represent the adaptation of a protein to a particular ligand. Cross-docking is a validation procedure consisting in docking a series of ligands into different conformation of the same receptor. Since the structures of the same receptor can be rather different, the cross-docking analyses are typically very poor. In these cases the internal cavity of the buried binding pocket does not have space enough to accommodate all ligands and this can radically affect the outcome and alter the cross-docking results. The changes of the cavity volume might explain the failure of traditional docking method and support the hypothesis that a single representative structure for the receptor is not enough. Keeping target proteins flexible during the docking has a high computational cost. To overcome this limit, our docking strategy is to represent receptor flexibility through an inexpensive method that generates a series of target structures. Starting from a known target structure, we used the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to explore the conformational changes induced by ligand binding and to collect several snapshots of receptor structures to perform the cross-docking studies. To validate the accuracy of our flexible protocol in docking, we used a set of 10 crystallographic conformations of Androgen Receptor with the same target but with a different ligand. We performed two parallel experiments of docking, one with a rigid protein target and one considering flexible receptor structures. In addition, we compared the results for both experiments in the re-docking and in the cross-docking analysis.\n\nMethods\n\nTen receptor structures complexed with a ligand were extracted from the X-ray structures in the PDB database (Berman et al., 2000). Several conformations for each receptor were selected from the molecular dynamics simulations (MD) at regular time intervals (each 500 ps). The MD simulations were performed with the software YASARA Structure 16.2.14 (Krieger & Vriend, 2014) using AMBER14 as force field. The molecular docking simulations were performed using VINA provided in the YASARA package.\n"Abstract truncated at 3,000 characters - the full version is available in the pdf file"', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2199/', ['Bioinformatics', 'Computational Science'], [u'Department of Pharmacy, University of Salerno', u'Department of Industrial Engineering, University of Salerno']]

Names for \u201dsubstances\u201d used in food products are rarely precise. The term bamboo (Bambusoideae, Poaceae) comprises over 1600 distinct species of which only few are well established sources for food products on the European market (i.e. bamboo sprouts).\nMethods. We analysed bamboo species and tea products containing an exotic ingredient (bamboo leaves) using anatomical leaf characters and DNA sequence data. Our primary concern was to determine the taxonomic origin of bamboo leaves to establish a baseline for EU legislation, to introduce a simple PCR based test to distinguish bamboo from other Poaceae leaf components and to assess the diagnostic potential of DNA Barcoding markers to resolve taxonomic entities within the bamboo subfamily and tribes.\nResults. Based on anatomical and DNA data we can pinpoint the taxonomic origin of genuine bamboo leaves used in commercial products to the genera Phyllostachys and Pseudosasa from the temperate \u201dwoody\u201d bamboo tribe (Arundinarieae).

However, analysis of community amplicon sequencing data requires multiple computational steps which affect the outcome of a final data set. Here we use mock communities to describe the effects of parameter adjustments for raw sequence quality filtering, picking operational taxonomic units (OTUs), taxonomic assignment, and OTU table filtering as implemented in QIIME 1.9.1. We demonstrate a workflow optimization based upon this exploration which we also apply to environmental samples. We found that quality filtering of raw data and filtering of OTU tables had large effects on observed OTU diversity. While all taxonomy assigners performed with similar accuracy, an appropriate choice of similarity threshold for defining OTUs depended on the method used for OTU picking. Our \u201cdefault\u201d analysis in QIIME overestimated mock community diversity by at least a factor of ten, compared to the optimized analysis which correctly characterized the taxonomic composition of the mock communities while still overestimating OTU diversity by about a factor of two. Though observed relative abundances of mock community member taxa were approximately correct, most were still represented by multiple OTUs. Low-frequency OTUs conspecific to constituent mock community taxa were characterized by multiple substitution and indel errors and the presence of a low quality base call resulting in sequence truncation during quality filtering. Low quality base calls were observed at \u201cG\u201d positions most of the time, and were also associated with a preceding \u201cTTT\u201d trinucleotide motif. Environmental diversity estimates were reduced by about 40% from 2508 to 1533 OTUs when comparing output from the default and optimized workflows. We attribute this reduction in observed diversity to the removal of erroneous sequences from the data set.

[u'Loop size optimization: a new mechanism for protein stabilization', ['Alessia Ruggiero', 'Nicole Balasco', 'Luciana Esposito', 'Luigi Vitagliano'], u'2016-07-01', u'Motivation\n\nOne of the fundamental issues in both chemistry and biology is the identification of the structural determinants that dictate protein folding and stability. The decoding of the folding code of protein structures would have a major impact on native structure prediction and on de novo design. This task is particularly difficult to achieve. Unlike synthetic polymers, protein structures combine complexity, fine-tuning and marginal stability. Despite these difficulties, in recent years major progresses have been made. A very recent breakthrough in the field is represented by the discovery of Baker and colleagues that the juxtaposition of basic secondary structure elements (\u03b1-helices and \u03b2-strands) follows well-defined rules ( Koga et al., 2012 ) . These investigations identified three fundamental rules for the preferences of \u03b2\u2113\u03b2 (strand-loop-strand), \u03b1\u2113\u03b2 (helix-loop-strand) and \u03b2\u2113\u03b1 (strand-loop-helix) structural motifs. In particular, it was shown that the chirality of \u03b2\u2113\u03b2 and the orientation of \u03b2\u2113\u03b1/\u03b1\u2113\u03b2 strongly depend on the loop size. In this framework, we evaluated the impact of these rules on protein structures isolated from either (hyper)thermophilic or mesophilic organisms. We used the thioredoxin (Trx) system to experimentally validate the results emerged from the statistical analyses.\n\nMethods\n \n\n\n Statistical surveys \n\nOur statistical survey was based on the analyses of different structural databases made of proteins isolated from mesophilic or thermophilic organisms by assuming that the proteins of thermophilic species were on average more stable than those isolated from mesophilic ones. The adherence of these proteins to the rules identified by Baker and coworkers was evaluated.\n\n Experiments \n\nWild-type E. coli Trx and a series of ad-hoc mutants were expressed and purified. The stability of these proteins was evaluated by CD spectroscopy. The structure of these variants was determined by X-ray crystallography.\n\nResults\n\nThe statistical analyses indicate that in proteins isolated from thermophilic organisms better adhere to the Baker rules through the optimization of the size of the loop connecting secondary structure elements ( Balasco et al., 2013 ) . We then experimentally validated this mechanism using the thioredoxin isolated from E.coli (EcTrx), a widely characterized protein that has been used as a model in a large number of investigations ( Esposito et al., 2012 , Ruggiero et al., 2009 ) . Comparative analyses of loop sizes between EcTrx and Trx isolated from hyperthermophiles suggested that the size loop connecting helix 1 (\u03b11) to strand 2 (\u03b22) in EcTrx could be modified to better follow the rules. Chimeric variants were therefore prepared by replacing the loop of EcTrx with the corresponding ones present in the Trx isolated from Sulfolobus solfataricus and S. tokodaii.\n\nAbstract truncated at 3,000 characters - the full version is available in the pdf file', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2195/', ['Biochemistry', 'Computational Biology'], [u'Institute of Biostructures and Bioimaging, C.N.R.', u'Dipartimento di Scienze e Tecnologie Ambientali Biologiche e Farmaceutiche, Seconda Universit\xe0 di Napoli']]
