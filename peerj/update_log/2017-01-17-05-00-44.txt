[u'Pollen extracts increase growth of a trypanosome parasite of bumble bees', ['Evan C Palmer-Young'], u'2017-01-16', u'Phytochemicals produced by plants, including at flowers, function in protection against plant diseases, and have a long history of use against trypanosome infection. Floral nectar and pollen, the sole food sources for many species of insect pollinators, contain phytochemicals that have been shown to reduce trypanosome infection in bumble and honey bees when fed as isolated compounds. Nectar and pollen, however, consist of phytochemical mixtures, which can have greater antimicrobial activity than do single compounds. This study tested the hypothesis that pollen extracts would inhibit parasite growth.Extracts of six different pollens were tested for direct inhibitory activity against cell cultures of the bumble bee trypanosome gut parasite Crithidia bombi.\nSurprisingly, pollen extracts increased parasite growth rather than inhibiting it. Experimental manipulations of growth media showed that supplemental monosaccharides (glucose and fructose) were sufficient to promote growth, while a common floral phytochemical (caffeic acid) with inhibitory activity against other trypanosomes had only weak inhibitory effects on Crithidia bombi. These results indicate that, although pollen is essential for bees and other pollinators, pollen may promote growth of intestinal parasites that are uninhibited by pollen phytochemicals and, as a result, can benefit from the nutrients that pollen provides.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2730/', ['Ecology', 'Entomology', 'Parasitology', 'Plant Science', 'Infectious Diseases'], [u'Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, University of Massachusetts at Amherst']]
