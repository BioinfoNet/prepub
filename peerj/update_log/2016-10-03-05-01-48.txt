[u'An exploratory study of the state of practice of performance testing in Java-based open source projects', ['Philipp Leitner', 'Cor-Paul Bezemer'], u'2016-10-02', u'The usage of open source (OS) software is nowadays wide- spread across many industries and domains. While the functional quality of OS projects is considered to be up to par with that of closed-source software, much is unknown about the quality in terms of non-functional attributes, such as performance. One challenge for OS developers is that, unlike for functional testing, there is a lack of accepted best practices for performance testing. To reveal the state of practice of performance testing in OS projects, we conduct an exploratory study on 111 Java-based OS projects from GitHub. We study the performance tests of these projects from five perspectives: (1) the developers, (2) size, (3) organization and (4) types of performance tests and (5) the tooling used for performance testing. First, in a quantitative study we show that writing performance tests is not a popular task in OS projects: performance tests form only a small portion of the test suite, are rarely updated, and are usually maintained by a small group of core project developers. Second, we show through a qualitative study that even though many projects are aware that they need performance tests, developers appear to struggle implementing them. We argue that future performance testing frameworks should provider better support for low-friction testing, for instance via non-parameterized methods or performance test generation, as well as focus on a tight integration with standard continuous integration tooling.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2496/', ['Software Engineering'], [u'Software Evolution and Architecture Lab, University of Zurich', u"Software Analysis and Intelligence Lab (SAIL), Queen's University"]]
[u'Precipitation and aridity index regulating spatial patterns of vegetation production and species diversity based on alpine grassland transect, Tibetan Plateau', ['Jian Sun'], u'2016-10-02', u'Although the relationship between the aboveground net primary production (ANPP) and speciesdiversity (SR) have been widely reported, there is considerable disagreement about the fitting patterns of SR\u2013ANPP, which has been variously described as \u2018positive\u2019, \u2018negative\u2019, \u2018unimodal\u2019, \u2018U-shaped\u2019 and so on. Not surprisingly, the effect-factors including precipitation, aridity index and geographic conditions (e.g.,altitude, longitude and latitude) on ANPP and SR continue to interest researchers, especially the effects at high altitude regions. We investigated ANPP and SR from 113 sampled sites (399 plots) across alpine meadow and steppe in the Tibetan Plateau, which included Tibet, Qinghai and Sichuan province. The effects of various environmental factors (precipitation, temperature, aridity index, altitude, longitude,latitude and vegetation type on SR and ANPP) were explored. The results indicate that a unimodal pattern was confirmed between ANPP and SR in alpine steppe (R 2  =0.45,  P  <0.0001), alpine meadow ( R 2  =0.4,  P  <0.0001), and all samples across alpine grassland ( R 2  =0.52,  P  <0.0001). For the aboveground net primary production, the appropriate precipitation and aridity is 600mm and 42, respectively. Under thesame moisture conditions, the maximum value of diversity is 0.75. Longitude ( R 2  =0.69,  P  <0.0001) and altitude ( R 2  =0.48, P  <0.0001) have positive and negative effects on aboveground net primary production, and a similar relationship exists with diversity ( R 2  =0.44, P  <0.0001 and R 2  =0.3,  P  <0.0001).The same patterns of diversity and production responding to precipitation and the aridity index were evident in alpine steppe and meadow, and a unimodal pattern was confirmed between ANPP and SR in both locations.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2495/', ['Biodiversity', 'Biogeography', 'Ecosystem Science'], [u'Institute of Geographical Sciences and Natural Resources Research,Chinese Academy of Sciences']]
