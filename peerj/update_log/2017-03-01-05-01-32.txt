We present qPortal, a web-based science gateway providing users with an intuitive way to manage and analyze quantitative biological data. Pre-programmed analysis pipelines, quality control workflows, and visualization tools are offered to the user. Through intensive user interactions, appropriate data models have been developed. These models build the biological data management system and provide possibilities to annotate data, query existing metadata for statistics and future re-analysis on a high-performance computing system via a coupling to gUSE, a workflow management system.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2839/', ['Bioinformatics', 'Computational Biology', 'Data Science', 'Databases', 'Distributed and Parallel Computing'], [u'Applied Bioinformatics, Center for Bioinformatics T\xfcbingen, University of T\xfcbingen', u'University of T\xfcbingen, Quantitative Biology Center (QBiC)', u'Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology']]
[u'The impact of using large training data set KDD99 on classification accuracy', ['Atilla Ozgur', 'Hamit Erdem'], u'2017-03-01', u'This study investigates the effects of using a large data set on supervised machine learning classifiers in the domain of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). To investigate this effect 12 machine learning algorithms have been applied. These algorithms are: (1) Adaboost, (2) Bayesian Nets, (3) Decision Tables, (4) Decision Trees (J48), (5)Logistic Regression, (6) Multi-Layer Perceptron, (7) Naive Bayes, (8) OneRule, (9)Random Forests, (10) Radial Basis Function Neural Networks, (11) Support Vector Machines (two different training algorithms), and (12) ZeroR. A well-known IDS benchmark dataset, KDD99 has been used to train and test classifiers. Full training data set of KDD99 is 4.9 million instances while full test dataset is 311,000 instances. In contrast to similar previous studies, which used 0.08%\u201310% for training and 1.2%\u2013100% for testing, this study uses full training dataset and full test dataset. Weka Machine Learning Toolbox has been used for modeling and simulation. The performance of classifiers has been evaluated using standard binary performance metrics: Detection Rate, True Positive Rate, True Negative Rate, False Positive Rate, False Negative Rate, Precision, and F1-Rate. To show effects of dataset size, performance of classifiers has been also evaluated using following hardware metrics: Training Time, Working Memory and Model Size. Test results shows improvements in classifiers in standard performance metrics compared to previous studies.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2838/', ['Data Mining and Machine Learning', 'Data Science'], [u'Electrical Engineering, Ba\u015fkent University']]
[u'Short-term starvation at low temperature prior to harvest does not impact the health and acute stress response of adult Atlantic salmon', ['Rune  Waagb', 'Sven Martin  Jrgensen', 'Gerrit Timmerhaus', 'Olav Breck', 'Pal A Olsvik'], u'2017-03-01', u'Period of starvation is regarded as a sound practice in aquaculture prior to handling, transportation and harvest, to minimise impacts on welfare and ensure proper hygiene after harvest. However, documentation of welfare issues such as stress following starvation and handling in adult Atlantic salmon are lacking. This study aimed to examine gut emptying and potential stress during a two weeks starvation period, and whether this starvation period changes the tolerance for physical stress. The study confirmed slower emptying of the gut segments at low temperature. Plasma and bile cortisol, and selected clinical analyses were used to characterize potential stress, as well as the response to acute physical crowding stress during the starvation period. Neither the general stress level nor the ability to cope with handling stress was affected by a 14 days starvation period. Down-regulation of selected nutritional related gene markers in liver indicated classical starvation responses, with reduced metabolism and oxidative pressure, and sparing of nutrients. The response to acute handling stress was not affected by two weeks of starvation. There were minor effects of starvation on stress and health markers, as evaluated by plasma lysozyme activity and gene expression of selected inflammation marker proteins in heart and skin tissues.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2837/', ['Aquaculture, Fisheries and Fish Science', 'Veterinary Medicine', 'Metabolic Sciences'], [u'National Institute of Nutrition and Seafood Research', u'Nofima', u'Marine Harvest ASA', u'National Institute of Nutrition and seafood Research']]

[u'Toward a collective understanding of medical education research: The DIMER dialogue instrument', ['Nabil Zary', 'Shien Chue'], u'2017-03-01', u'Medical education research embraces theoretical and methodological diversities. Researchers are motivated by the quest for deepening knowledge as well as attracting funding for new educational initiatives and technologies. However, it remains a daunting endeavour to locate and aggregate findings into consistent themes. Reasons are at least twofold. The discourse of a discipline provides the language for representing its work and crossing between disciplines is challenging. Secondly, medical education is understood as an idiosyncratic collection of concepts appropriated from other educational field and the medical education community is unsure about whether to construe medical education as a medical or a social science. To overcome these challenges, we propose a dialogue instrument that draws together cross cutting research perspectives, stakeholders & learning domains to build bridges within medical curriculum, methods, assessment and experiences research. Consequently, this dialogue instrument advocates a nuance understanding of medical education research as a means for building collective knowledge for impacting education and health outcomes.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2835/', ['Science and Medical Education'], [u'Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University']]

Peaches are the prominent species among the fruits due to having diverse germplasm around the globe with largest number of commercial genotypes. Pakistan is also rich in various cultivars of peaches that are rarely studied for its genetic diversity. An attempt was, therefore, made to study the phenotypic variation in peach tree and fruit characteristic of 7 desirable cultivars (namely A669, Texas y-455, Florida King, Arctic Fantacy, Spring Creast, Micholea and Swanee). Methods. All cultivars were grown at the Experimental Peach Block at Barani Agriculture Research Institute (BARI), Chakwal, Punjab-Pakistan. Tree traits such as growth habit, leaf characteristics, flower characteristics, morphological and biochemical fruit traits were evaluated by using IBPGR peach descriptors. Results. Extensive variation was found among the cultivars for various traits, including tree growth (weeping, compact or open whereas), leaf length (9.0 \xb1 0.8 to 12.0 \xb1 0.4 cm), leaf width (2.6 \xb1 0.1 to 3.3 \xb1 0.2 cm), fruit weight (45.6 \xb13.3 to 107 \xb1 8.8 g) and stone weight (4.3 \xb1 0.2 to 7.5 \xb1 0.4 g). Besides, a significant variation among the various cultivars has also been observed regarding, titratable acidity (0.64 \xb1 0.02 to 1.19 \xb1 0.04%), \xb0Brix (7.17 \xb1 0.62 to 11.27 \xb1 0.21), ripening index (6.02 \xb1 0.72 to 17.2 \xb1 0.44), Vitamin C (75.3 \xb1 15 to 116.1 \xb1 10.5 mg 100 g-1), total sugar (13.52 \xb1 0.50 to 20.84 \xb1 1.23%), reducing sugar (5.68 \xb1 0.11 to 7.25 \xb1 0.51%), non-reducing sugar (4.12 \xb1 0.45 to 10.77 \xb1 0.8%), total phenolics (176.20 \xb1 7.18 to 317.72 \xb1 4.66 mg GAE 100 g-1), radical scavenging activity (44.25 \xb1 0.28 to 78.17 \xb1 1.43%) and reducing power (0.12 \xb1 0.1 to 0.22 \xb1 0.03).

Because of difficulty in counting individual monarchs, the number of hectares occupied by monarchs in the overwintering area is commonly used as a proxy for population size, which is then multiplied by the density of individuals per hectare to estimate population size. There is, however, considerable variation in published estimates of overwintering density, ranging from 6.9\u201360.9 million ha-1. We develop a probability distribution for overwinter density of monarch butterflies from six published density estimates. The mean density among the mixture of the six published estimates was ~27.9 million butterflies ha-1 (95% CI: 2.4\u201380.7 million ha-1); the mixture distribution is approximately log-normal, and as such is better represented by the median (21.1 million butterflies ha-1). Based upon assumptions regarding the number of milkweed needed to support monarchs, the amount of milkweed (Asclepias spp.) lost (0.86 billion stems) in the northern U.S. plus the amount of milkweed remaining (1.34 billion stems), we estimate >1.8 billion stems is needed to return monarchs to an average population size of 6 ha. Considerable uncertainty exists in this required amount of milkweed because of the considerable uncertainty occurring in overwinter density estimates. Nevertheless, the estimate is on the same order as other published estimates. The studies included in our synthesis differ substantially by year, location, method, and measures of precision. A better understanding of the factors influencing overwintering density across space and time would be valuable for increasing the precision of conservation recommendations.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2832/', ['Conservation Biology', 'Ecology', 'Entomology', 'Mathematical Biology'], [u'Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center, United States Geological Survey', u'Geosciences and Environmental Change Science Center, United States Geological Survey', u'School of Natural Resources and the Environment and Udall Center for Studies in Public Policy, University of Arizona', u'Department of Fisheries, Wildlife and Conservation Biology, University of Minnesota', u'Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Organismal Biology, Iowa State University', u'Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California, San Diego', u'Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Kansas', u'Everglades Foundation']]
