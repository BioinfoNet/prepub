[u'A reconstruction of the palaeoecology and environmental dynamics of the Bahariya Formation of Egypt', ['Jamale Ijouiher'], u'2016-09-22', u'The Bahariya formation is one of the most productive in Africa in terms of fossil material. This paper conducts a comprehensive review of the flora & fauna and creates ecological reconstruction of this assemblage based on modern analogues. There is no evidence that most of the major vertebrate components of this biome were mangrove adapted taxa & most were commuters from the surrounding mainland. The high number of theropod species is overstated as niche partitioning between them lowers the predator/prey ratios; and is a result of this habitat developing from the broader North African ecosystems with its limited vegetation. The populations of most were also limited; further offsetting the predator/prey imbalance. The rarity of ornithopods can now be seen as a result of aridity and simplified forest structure. Crustaceans can be confirmed as forming a major trophic base, but new emphasis needs to be placed on gastropods as potential ecosystem engineers. Although some questions still remain concerning missing faunal elements and the difficulty in differentiate local population patterns from general population trends in this ecosystem as a whole; Bahariya\u2019s reportedly substantial productivity, and later over-productivity, can now be confirmed.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2470/', ['Ecology', 'Ecosystem Science', 'Paleontology'], [u'independent researcher']]
[u'Molecular characterization and genetic diversity of Jatropha curcas L. in Costa Rica', ['Marcela Vasquez-Mayorga', 'Eric J Fuchs', 'Eduardo J Hernandez', 'Franklin Herrera', 'Jesus Hernandez', 'Ileana Maria Moreira', 'Elizabeth Arnaez', 'Natalia M Barboza'], u'2016-09-22', u'We estimated the genetic diversity of 50 Jatropha curcas Costa Rican samples using 18 EST-SSR, one G-SSR and nrDNA-ITS markers. We also evaluated the phylogenetic relationships among samples using nuclear ribosomal ITS markers. Non-toxicity was also evaluated using G-SSRs and SCARs markers. A Neighbor-Joining (NJ) tree and a Maximum Likelihood (ML) tree were constructed using SSR markers and ITS sequences, respectively. Heterozygosity was moderate (He = 0.346), but considerable when compared to worldwide values for J. curcas. The PIC (PIC = 0.276) and inbreeding coefficient (f = -0.102) were both low. Clustering was not related to the geographical origin of accessions but Costa Rican J. curcas consistently clustered as a separate group. International accessions clustered independently of collection sites suggesting a lack of genetic structure, probably due to a wide distribution of this crop and ample gene flow. Molecular markers identified only one non-toxic accession (JCCR-24) from Mexico.

[u'The effects of autotomy and regeneration on the locomotion and behavior or brittle stars (Echinodermata: Ophiuroidea) of Moorea, French Polynesia', ['Chandler M Shaeffer'], u'2016-09-22', u'Autotomy and regeneration of body parts is a defense mechanism that a multitude of taxa have evolved in order to escape predation. While both autotomy and regeneration are very commonly observed traits in brittle stars, little has been studied about them in relation to many aspects of their ecology, including its effects on their locomotion and behavior. This study compared the tendency to autotomize across brittle star taxa by way of a field survey and quantified the effects of autotomy on the locomotion and behavioral ecology of genus Ophiocoma. This was done by taking and analyzing videos the movements of eighteen individuals over the course of four weeks, comparing locomotive and behavioral changes over the course of the autotomization and regenerative process. Of the three genera of large epibenthic brittle star found, there was no one genus that seemed more likely to autotomize than another. When examining the effects of autotomy on Ophiocoma, there were very few differences among any of the sampling periods or treatments. Any changes occurred immediately after autotomy, but did not persist for more than that one sampling period, and yielded results comparable to those of pre-autotomy one week into regeneration. This may imply that Ophiocoma\u2014and brittle stars as a whole\u2014are extremely well adapted to autotomy as a defense strategy, more so than many other taxa who also employ autotomy as a defense mechanism.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2471/', ['Animal Behavior', 'Ecology', 'Marine Biology'], [u'Environmental Science, Policy, and Management, University of California, Berkeley']]
[u'The wild tomato species Solanum chilense shows local variation in pathogen resistance between geographically distinct populations', ['Remco Stam', 'Daniela Scheikl', 'Aurelien Tellier'], u'2016-09-22', u'Wild tomatoes are a valuable source of disease resistance germplasm for tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) breeders. Many species are known to possess a certain degree of resistance against certain pathogens, however evolution of resistance traits is yet poorly understood. For some species, like Solanum chilense, both differences in habitat and within species genetic diversity is very large. Here we aim to investigate the occurrence of spatially heterogeneous coevolutionary pressures between populations of S. chilense. We investigate the phenotypic differences in disease resistance within S. chilense against three common tomato pathogens (Alternaria solani, Phytophthora infestans and a Fusarium sp.) and confirm high degrees of variability in resistance properties between selected populations. Using generalised linear mixed models, we show that disease resistance does not follow the known demographic patterns of the species. Models with up to five available climatic and geographic variables are required to best describe resistance differences, confirming the complexity of factors involved in local resistance variation. We confirm that within S. chilense, resistance properties against various pathogens show a mosaic pattern and do not follow environmental patterns, indicating the strength of local pathogen pressures. Our study can form the basis for further investigations of the genetic traits involved.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2468/', ['Ecology', 'Evolutionary Studies', 'Plant Science'], [u'Section of Population Genetics, Technical University of Munich']]
[u'An extension to the spherical metric using polar linear interpolation', ['Daniel J Greenhoe'], u'2016-09-22', u'The spherical metric d_r operates on the surface of a sphere with radius r centered at the origin in a linear space R^n. Thus, for any pair of points (p,q) on the surface of this sphere, (p,q) is in the domain of d_r and d_r(p,q) is the "distance" between those points. However, if x and y are both in R^n but are not on the surface of a common sphere centered at the origin, then (p,q) is not in the domain of d_r and d_r(p,q) is simply undefined. In certain applications, however, it would be useful to have an extension d of d_r to the entire space R^n (rather than just on a surface in R^n). Real world applications for such an extended metric include calculations involving near earth objects, and for certain distance spaces useful in symbolic sequence processing. This paper introduces an extension to the spherical metric using a polar form of linear interpolation. The extension is herein called the "Lagrange arc distance". It has as its domain the entire space R^n, is homogeneous, and is continuous everywhere in R^n except at the origin. However the extension does come at a cost: The Lagrange arc distance d(p,q), as its name suggests, is a distance function rather than a metric. In particular, the triangle inequality does not in general hold. Moreover, it is not translation invariant, does not induce a norm, and balls in the distance space (R^n,d) are not convex. On the other hand, empirical evidence suggests that the Lagrange arc distance results in structure similar to that of the Euclidean metric in that balls in R^2 and R^3 generated by the two functions are in some regions of R^n very similar in form.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2467/', ['Scientific Computing and Simulation', 'Spatial and Geographic Information Systems'], [u'National Chiao Tung University']]

Potential subjects were then tested with the different types of p variables such as food and sunlight. At this time all the Black Soldier flies were kept in specific conditions and tested with different types of habitats. These habitats reflected the living conditions of the flies in the natural plain. After all the data was compiled, it was aggregated and used to find the best living conditions for the Black Soldier fly as a model organism.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2466/', ['Agricultural Science', 'Animal Behavior', 'Developmental Biology', 'Ecology'], [u'University of Chicago Laboratory Schools']]
