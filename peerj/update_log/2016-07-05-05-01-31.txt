[u'Why respiratory viruses or bacteria have the highest probability to be deposited in the respiratory tract in flu seasons', ['Aleksandr N Ishmatov'], u'2016-07-04', u'Marc Lipsitch and C\xe9cile Viboud (2009) (Lipsitch and Viboud, 2009): \u201cSeasonal variation in the incidence of communicable diseases is among the oldest observations in population biology, dating back at least to ancient Greece, yet our understanding of the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remains hazy at best.\u201d\nThe latest researches show the infected people when breathing generate the infectious aerosols with particles below 1 \xb5m. The airborne transmission of these particles is effective but the deposition of submicron particles in the respiratory tract (RT) has very low probability.\nHere I investigated the processes in RT when breathing cold air and its role in the delivery of viruses and bacteria of submicron and ultrafine sizes in RT.\nThe original hypothesis of the highest probability of delivery and deposition of viruses or bacteria from inhaled air in the respiratory tract during flu seasons in different climatic conditions was investigated.\nOn the basis of estimation I have originally shown: Breathing cool air leads to the supersaturation of air in RT; the air supersaturation leads to the intensive condensational growth(CG) of inhaled viruses or bacteria in RT; CG leads to the intensive and dramatically growth of deposition rate of viruses or bacteria in RT.\nUnder normal conditions of inhaled air (T>20\u02daC; RH=60%) there is no transition in oversaturated condition in RT (CG is insignificant and probability of virus deposition on epithelium of RT is low \u2013 no more than 20%).\nBut with an increase in RH of inhaled air the oversaturation in RT occurs even at warm temperature of inhaled air. For inhaled air of T=20\xb0C, RH>70% the local supersaturation in the airways occurs: the concentration of liquid water in the mixed air in RT (\u0421Liq) is \u0421Liq<2\xb74g/kg and for T=25\xb0C; RH>90% \u0421Liq<1\xb72g/kg.\nThe estimation also shown that for conditions of breathing cold air of T [-15..+15]\u02daC and Relatively Humidity (RH) of [30..60]% the supersaturation in the airways occurs: the concentration of liquid water in the mixed air in RT (\u0421Liq) is [0\xb72..12\xb71]g/kg.\nUnder these conditions the growth of inhaled particles by condensation in RT is significant. It lead to the dramatically growth of deposition rate of the viruses and bacteria in RT (up to 97%).\nThese results correspond to influenza and seasonal respiratory infections in temperate and tropical climates and indicate the high probability of virus deposition on epithelium of RT.\nIt may be the key to \u2018the age-old epidemiologic mystery of influenza seasonality in the different climatic conditions\u2019.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2237/', ['Epidemiology', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Public Health', 'Respiratory Medicine'], [u'Tomsk State University']]
[u'Statistical methods for identifying sequence motifs affecting point mutations', ['Yicheng Zhu', 'Teresa M Neeman', 'Von Bing Yap', 'Gavin A Huttley'], u'2016-07-04', u'Mutation processes differ between types of point mutation, genomic locations, cells, and biological species. For some point mutations, specific neighbouring bases are known to be mechanistically influential. Beyond these cases, numerous questions remain unresolved including: what are the sequence motifs that affect point mutations? how large are the motifs? and, do they vary between samples? We present new log-linear models that allow explicit examination of these questions along with sequence logo style visualisation to enable identifying specific motifs. We demonstrate the utility of these methods by analysing human germline and malignant melanoma mutations. We recapitulate the known CpG effect and identify numerous novel motifs, including a highly significant motif associated with A\u2192G mutations. We show that major effects of neighbourhood on germline mutation lie within \xb12 of the mutating base. Models are also presented for contrasting the entire mutation spectra (the distribution of the different point mutations) and applied to the data. We show the spectra vary significantly between autosomes and X-chromosome, with a difference in T\u2192C transition dominating.

The definition of a spatially distributed value of SDR is a very important task as the sediment routing can affect solid transport in stream channels, water quality degradation, and frequency increase of natural disasters such as debris flows and mudflows. For such reason the SDR evaluation, coupled with GIS approach, has been extensively used in scientific literature. Geographic information systems provide a fundamental support for a better prediction of the SDR, since it can consider the space variability of factors influencing the sediment routing processes. Actually a specific GIS module to estimate the spatial variability of SDR does not exist. We implemented a GRASS GIS module (in python language) called r.sdr where the sediment delivery ratio is evaluated by GIS procedure by using several SDR equations available in literature.
