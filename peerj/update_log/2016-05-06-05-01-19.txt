[u'Antimicrobial activities of widely consumed herbal tea\u2019s alone or in combination with antibiotics: An in vitro study', ['Mayram Tuysuz', 'Sibel Dosler', 'Ayse Seher Birteksoz Tan', 'Gulten Otuk'], u'2016-05-06', u'Background: Because of increasing antibiotic resistance, herbal teas are the most popular natural alternatives, which are gaining even more importance. We examined the antimicrobial activities of 31 herbal teas both alone and in combination with antibiotics or antifungals against the standard and clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible/resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. Methods: The antimicrobial activities of the teas were determined by using the disk diffusion and microbroth dilution methods, and the combination studies were examined by using the microbroth checkerboard and time killing curve methods. Results: Rosehip, rosehip bag, pomegranate blossom, thyme, wormwood, mint, echinacea bag, cinnamon, black, and green teas were active against most of the studied microorganisms. In the combination studies, we characterized all the expected effects (synergistic, additive, and antagonistic) between the teas and the antimicrobials. While synergy was observed more frequently between ampicillin, ampicillin-sulbactam, or nystatine, and the various tea combinations, most of the effects between the ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, cefuroxime, or amikacin and various tea combinations, particularly rosehip, rosehip bag, and pomegranate blossom teas, were antagonistic. The results of the time kill curve analyses showed that none of the herbal teas were bactericidal in their usage concentrations; however, in combination they were. Discussion: Some herbal teas, particularly rosehip and pomegranate blossom should be avoided because of antagonistic interactions during the course of antibiotic treatment or should be consumed alone.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2029/', ['Food Science and Technology', 'Microbiology', 'Nutrition'], [u'Department of Pharmaceutical Microbiology, Istanbul University']]
