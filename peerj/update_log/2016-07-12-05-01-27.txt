[u'Differences in pollination success between local and foreign flower color phenotypes: a translocation experiment with Gentiana lutea (Gentianaceae)', ['Javier A Guitian', 'Mar Sobral', 'Tania Veiga', 'Maria Losada', 'Pablo Guitian', 'Jose M Guitian'], u'2016-07-11', u'Background. The adaptive maintenance of flower color variation is frequently attributed to pollinators in part because they preferentially visit certain flower phenotypes. We test whether Gentiana lutea \u2013 which shows a flower color variation (from orange to yellow) in the Cantabrian Mountains range (north of Spain) \u2212 is locally adapted to the pollinator community.\nMethods. We transplant orange-flowering individuals to a population with yellow-flowering individuals and vice-versa, to assess whether there is a pollination advantage in the local morph comparing its visitation rate with the foreign morph.\nResults. Our reciprocal transplant experiment showed no clear signal of local morph advantage at one site; thus, there is no evidence of local adaptation in Gentiana lutea to the pollinator assemblage. However, some floral visitor groups (such as Bombus pratorum, B. soroensis ancaricus and B. lapidarius decipiens) consistently preferred the local morph to the foreign morph whereas others (such as Bombus terrestris) consistently preferred the foreign morph.\nDiscussion. We concluded that there is no evidence of local adaptation to the pollinator community in each of the two G. lutea populations studied. The consequences for local adaptation to pollinator on G. lutea flower color would depend on the variation along the Cantabrian Mountains range in morph frequency and pollinator community composition.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2280/', ['Animal Behavior', 'Conservation Biology', 'Ecology', 'Evolutionary Studies', 'Plant Science'], [u'Departamento de Bot\xe1nica/Facultade de Biolox\xeda, Universidad de Santiago de Compostela', u'Departamento de Biolox\xeda celular e Ecolox\xeda/Facultade de Biolox\xeda, Universidad de Santiago de Compostela']]
[u'EvoPER -- An R package for applying evolutionary computation methods in the parameter estimation of individual-based models implemented in Repast', ['Antonio Prestes Garcia', 'Alfonso Rodriguez-Paton'], u'2016-07-11', u'Individual-based models are complex and they normally have an elevated number of input parameters which must be tuned in order to reproduce the experimental or observed data as accurately as possible. Hence one of the weakest points of such kind of models is the fact that rarely the modeler has the enough information about the correct values or even the acceptable range for the input parameters. Therefore, several parameter combinations must be checked to find an acceptable set of input factors minimizing the deviations of simulated and observed data. In practice, most of times, is computationally unfeasible to traverse the complete search space to check all parameter combination in order to find the best of them. That is precisely the kind of combinatorial problem suitable for evolutionary computation techniques. In this work we present the EvoPER, an R package for simplifying the parameter estimation using evolutionary computation techniques. The current version of EvoPER includes implementations of PSO, SA and ACO algorithms for parameter estimation of Repast models.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2279/', ['Bioinformatics', 'Computational Biology', 'Agents and Multi-Agent Systems', 'Scientific Computing and Simulation'], [u'Departamento de Inteligencia Artificial, Universidad Polit\xe9cnica de Madrid']]
[u'MetaCRAST: Reference-guided extraction of CRISPR spacers from unassembled metagenomes', ['Abraham G Moller', 'Chun Liang'], u'2016-07-11', u'Summary: Clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeat (CRISPR) systems are prokaryotic adaptive immune systems against phage infection. CRISPR spacer sequences can provide valuable ecological insights by linking environmental viruses to their microbial hosts. Despite this importance, metagenomic CRISPR detection remains a major challenge. Here we present a reference-guided CRISPR detection tool (Metagenomic CRISPR Reference-Aided Search Tool - MetaCRAST) that constrains searches based on user-specified direct repeats. These DRs could be expected from assembly or taxonomic profiles of metagenomic sequence data. Our evaluation shows MetaCRAST improves CRISPR spacer detection in real metagenomes compared to de novo detection methods. Simulations show it performs better than comparable tools when analyzing Illumina metagenomes.\nAvailability and implementation: MetaCRAST is implemented in Perl and takes metagenomic sequence reads and direct repeat queries in FASTA format as input.

[u'What is done and what has to be done in Lamiaceae, a review of phylogenetics', ['Nadia B Zahra', 'Zabta K Shinwari'], u'2016-07-11', u'The most recent classification proposed by Harley et al. in 2004 recognized seven subfamilies within the family Lamiaceae (Symphorematoideae, Viticoideae, Ajugoideae, Prostantheroideae, Scutellarioideae, Lamioideae and Nepetoideae). Symphorematoideae (formerly as part of Verbenaceae) is recognized as a subfamily of Lamiaceae for the first. Recognition of Viticoideae is one of the major modifications introduced in Harley\u2019s treatment but yet it is the least satisfactory circumscribed subfamily which appeared to be clearly non-monophyletic. Subsequent studies based on molecular analysis also reported the non-monophyly of Viticoideae. New combinations are proposed in later studies at the generic level in subfamily Ajugoideae and Prostantheroideae. Suprageneric relationships among the Lamioideae remained poorly understood providing no tribal ranks in the Harley\u2019s classification. Therefore, new tribes have been erected in the recent investigations to reflect improved phylogenetic undersanding of the Lamioideae. Subtribal delimitation of Mentheae (Nepetoideae) according to recent studies is not congruent with the Harley\u2019s and new subtribes are recommended to establish the monophyly of Mentheae. Although the clade structure is relatively well established in the Lamiaceae, but tribal compositions remain unclear and needs to be further investigated to transform their taxonomy into a more \u2018natural\u2019 classification.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2277/', ['Biotechnology', 'Plant Science', 'Taxonomy'], [u'Department of Biotechnology, Quaid-i-Azam University']]
[u'The individual and social drivers of primate innovation', ['Lydia M Hopper'], u'2016-07-11', u"How does nonhuman primate innovation compare to our own? Many primates innovate, for example to get otherwise inaccessible food or to increase their social standing, and nonhuman primate innovation can be broken into three component steps. It begins with the initial invention, which is then transmitted to other members of the inventor\u2019s group, and is then adopted by other individuals and maintained within the society. These three steps \u2013 invention, transmission, and maintenance \u2013 are all required for innovation and in this review, I discuss the factors (social, environmental, and cognitive) that influence each step. I also highlight the comparable and contrasting features between human and nonhuman primate innovation. In contrast to human innovations, primate innovations are relatively simple and are typically self-serving. Nonhuman primates do not invent new products explicitly for the use of others (although group members certainly copy others' innovations) and nor are their inventions artistic or abstract in nature. Intriguingly, although chimpanzees and other nonhuman primates appear to be expert at copying others\u2019 inventions, there is far less evidence of their ability to build upon others\u2019 inventions (i.e., to show cumulative culture). At the core of our complex cultural world is the fidelity with which we copy others and our specialism at building upon the ideas of others. Thus, it is the cumulative nature of our innovative process that has created our complex material cultural world and is a key difference between how we innovate, learn and transmit knowledge, and how our chimpanzee cousins copy one another. Another difference is our ability to work collaboratively in teams to innovate and develop new technologies, as well as our potential to cooperate in an altruistic way that allows for planning for future generations. In conclusion, perhaps primate innovation can be most usefully likened to human \u2018user innovators\u2019 who typically innovate products or techniques to fill a personal need, rather than by being driven to create a product to go to market.", u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2276/', ['Animal Behavior', 'Anthropology', 'Neuroscience', 'Zoology'], [u'Lester E Fisher Center for the Study and Conservation of Apes, Lincoln Park Zoo']]
[u'Suspected anaphylaxis from intravenous cefazolin during general anaesthesia in a dog', ['Melanie Prebble', 'Daniel SJ Pang'], u'2016-07-11', u'A 6-year-old female Shetland Sheepdog with a history of cardiorespiratory compromise during general anaesthesia was referred for ovariohysterectomy surgery. Clinical examination was unremarkable at presentation and physiologic parameters under general anaesthesia were within expected ranges during preparation for surgery. Shortly after completion of an intravenous injection of cefazolin, the audible signal from the Doppler ultrasound unit stopped. A rapid survey of the patient revealed tachycardia with weak femoral pulses, tachypnoea, hyperpnoea and substantially increased resistance to manual positive pressure ventilation. Stopping inhalant anaesthesia, administering salbutamol, corticosteroids and diphenhydramine were associated with resolution of clinical signs. However, marked hypotension and resistance to ventilation recurred approximately 25 minutes later. Low dose intravenous epinephrine (5 mcg/kg) was effective at increasing arterial blood pressure and reversing respiratory dysfunction. Surgery was completed and the patient recovered uneventfully. Initial reliance on second line therapy and delay in administering epinephrine, the recommended treatment for anaphylaxis, may have slowed resolution of clinical signs.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2275/', ['Veterinary Medicine', 'Allergy and Clinical Immunology', 'Anaesthesiology and Pain Management', 'Emergency and Critical Care', 'Pharmacology'], [u'Western Veterinary Specialist and Emergency Centre', u'Veterinary Clinical and Diagnostic Sciences, University of Calgary']]
