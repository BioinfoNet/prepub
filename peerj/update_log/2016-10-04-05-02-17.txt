[u'High non publication rate from publication professionals hinders evidence-based publication practices: a replication study in Europe', ['Jacqueline M Marchington'], u'2016-10-04', u'Background: Although publication professionals plan and facilitate the timely and high-quality reporting of clinical trial results, it has been previously shown that they are not as forthcoming when it comes to publishing their own professional research. The publication rate from abstracts presented at the Annual Meeting of the International Society for Medical Publication Professionals (ISMPP) has been shown to be 2.4%. We performed a replication study based on the European Meeting of ISMPP to determine the equivalent publication rate.\nMethods: ISMPP European Meeting abstract lists (November 2011\u2013January 2016), were searched in July 2016 and extracted into a copy of the original study spreadsheet. MEDLINE was searched in August 2016 to determine the publication rate.\nResults: From 2011 to 2016, 76 abstracts were submitted of which 60 were accepted (78.9%). We found three corresponding publications (publication rate 5.0%). Most studies were observational (50/60; 83.3%) and most abstracts included employees of medical communications agencies as authors (50/60; 83.3%). Most researchers were based in Europe (165/222; 74.3%) or the US (53/222; 23.9%).\nDiscussion: This study confirms previous findings that the publication rate of member research from ISMPP meetings in the peer-reviewed literature is low. Members of ISMPP, and of other organizations who aspire to set professional standards, should be encouraged to conduct robust research and share it with the academic community.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2499/', ['Ethical Issues', 'Science and Medical Education'], [u'Caudex, McCann Complete Medical']]
[u'Fifteen novel microsatellites for the Louisiana Waterthrush (Aves: Parulidae: Parkesia motacilla) using MiSeq sequencing', ['R. Lynn Von Hagen', 'Rafia A Khan', 'Stefan Woltmann'], u'2016-10-03', u'The Louisiana Waterthrush (Parkesia motacilla) breeds along wooded streams throughout much of eastern North America, and winters in the Caribbean and Central America. Because of its dependence on stream macroinvertebrates\u2014which are themselves dependent on high water quality\u2014the Louisiana Waterthrush may serve as a useful bioindicator of both stream and landscape integrity. Perhaps unique among eastern North American songbirds, the Louisiana Waterthrush often maintains essentially linear territories along streams, and this provides a unique context in which to ask questions about the genetic (as opposed to social) mating system of this species. We developed 15 microsatellite loci for Louisiana Waterthrush using MiSeq sequencing. All loci presented here are polymorphic, with 3-15 alleles detected in a reference sample of 35-43 individuals. For parentage analyses, these loci have a combined non-exclusion probability of 0.0011 if neither parent is known a priori, and a non-exclusion probability of < 0.0001 if one parent is known. These 15 loci thus provide high discriminatory power to assign parentage to nestlings, and can also be used to examine population genetic structure within the species.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2498/', ['Ecology', 'Genetics', 'Molecular Biology', 'Zoology'], [u'Biology Department and Center of Excellence for Field Biology, Austin Peay State University', u'Department of Biology, Western Kentucky University', u'Department of Entomology and Nematology, University of Florida']]
[u'Genomic testing of landlocked Kildin cod (Gadus morhua kildinensis) for its ancestral state: stationary or migratory ecotype?', ['Anastasia A Teterina', 'Lev A Zhivotovsky'], u'2016-10-03', u'Kildin cod is a small landlocked population of Atlantic cod reproductively isolated from marine counterparts for around 1500-2000 years. The Kildin cod lives in a shallow meromictic lake in the five-meter intermediate layer of water with sharp gradients of oxygen and salinity. The cod had an effective population size of around one hundred individuals and evolved unique physiological, morphological and behavioral features. The marine Atlantic cod has two ecologically distinct forms: the stationary (coastal) and migratory (deep-water) ecotypes that differ in migratory behavior and habitat preferences (the depth, oxygen content, salinity and temperature). To understand the origin and genetic properties of Kildin cod, we scrutinized genomic regions associated with the cod ecotypes differentiation (LG1, LG2, and LG7) and found out that Kildin cod\u2019s regions LG2 and LG7 were fixed with the migratory variants, whereas polymorphic LG1 had a higher frequency of the stationary variant, that could be explained by the possible strong genetic drift. The lake cod investigated had four times lesser genome diversity than marine population. Our finding suggests that Kildin cod originated from the migratory ecotype of the marine cod.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2497/', ['Aquaculture, Fisheries and Fish Science', 'Biodiversity', 'Genetics', 'Genomics'], [u'Laboratory of Genetic Identification, Vavilov institute of General Genetics, RAS']]
