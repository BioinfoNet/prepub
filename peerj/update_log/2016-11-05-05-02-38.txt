[u'Doctor safety in Australian after-hours house-call medical services: the use of chaperones and chauffeurs', ['Chris Onyebuchi Ifediora'], u'2016-11-04', u'Objectives: The use of escorts (chauffeurs and chaperones) while on duty in after-hours-house-call (AHHC) is one key protective option available to doctors in the service and has been linked to low burnout and increased satisfaction in AHHC. This study aims to explore the patterns of engagement of escorts in Australian AHHC.\nMethod: A questionnaire-based, electronic survey of all 300 doctors involved in AHHC through the National Home Doctor Service (NHDS), Australia\u2019s largest providers of the service.\nResults: A total of 168 valid responses (56.0%) were received. 60.8% of the doctors engaged escorts. Of the doctors that engage chauffeurs, three-quarters do so \u201call or most times\u201d, while only one-quarter engage chaperones to the same degree of frequency. Hiring escorts is very popular among Brisbane (91.7%) and Sydney-based (88.2%) practitioners, but is unpopular in the City of Gold Coast (26.1%). There were moderate patronages in Adelaide (52.9%) and Melbourne (46.4%).\nCompared to females, males were more likely to drive themselves (OR 5.34; P=0.001; CI 2.08 to 13.74) and less likely to use chauffeurs (OR 0.19; p<0.001; CI 0.07 to 0.51). Doctors in legally recognized social unions (OR 0.24; p=0.03; CI 0.07 to 0.83) and those that have attained the postgraduate fellowships (OR 0.43; p=0.02; CI 0.21 to 0.87) were both less likely to work without escorts.\nConclusion: More needs to be done to increase the engagement of escorts by doctors involved in the Australian AHHC, particularly given their proven benefits in the service. Future studies may be needed to fully explore the real reasons behind the significant associations identified in this study.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2581/', ['Health Policy', 'Public Health'], [u'School of Medicine, Griffith University']]
[u'Endocrine disruption: where are we with hazard and risk assessment?', ['Katherine Coady', 'Peter Matthiessen', 'Holly M Zahner', 'Jane Staveley', 'Daniel J Caldwell', 'Steven L Levine', 'Jr., Leon Earl Gray', 'Christopher J Borgert'], u'2016-11-04', u'Approaches to assessing endocrine disruptors (EDs) differ across the globe, with some regulatory environments using a hazard-based approach, while others employ risk-based analyses. In session four of the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (SETAC) North America Focused Topic Meeting: Endocrine Disruption Chemical Testing: Risk Assessment Approaches and Implications (February 4 \u2013 6, 2014), various aspects related to the hazard and/or risk assessment of EDs were explored. The presentations in the session included an overview of the regulatory environments for assessing and managing endocrine disruptors, and scenarios whereby a hazard-based approach might be most appropriate were discussed. Three case studies for ED assessment, one for an industrial chemical, one for a pharmaceutical, and one for a pesticide, were presented. The topics of non-monotonic dose response relationships as well as potency and threshold effects were also presented in this session, since these concepts are important for determining whether a risk or hazard based approach to ED regulation is most appropriate. Session four concluded with an open discussion concerning the issue of hazard and risk as a basis for regulating EDCs. An outcome of session four was the drafting of an outreach statement that summarizes the overarching themes of this session.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2580/', ['Environmental Sciences', 'Toxicology', 'Science Policy'], [u'The Dow Chemical Company', u'Independent Consultant', u'Center for Veterinary Medicine, US Food and Drug Administration', u'Exponent, Inc.', u'Johnson & Johnson', u'Monsanto Company', u'Office of Research and Development, US Environmental Protection Agency', u'Applied Pharmacology and Toxicology and Center for Environmental and Human Toxicology, University of Florida']]
