[u'Intraspecific variation in the diet of the Mexican garter snake Thamnophis eques', ['Javier Manjarrez', 'Martha Pacheco-Tinoco', 'Crystian S Venegas-Barrera'], u'2016-09-13', u'The Mexican Garter Snake (Thamnophis eques) is a terrestrial-aquatic generalist because it feeds on both aquatic and terrestrial prey. We describe size-related variation and slight sexual variation in the diet of Thamnophis eques through analysis of 262 samples of identifiable stomach contents in snakes from 23 locations on the Mexican Plateau. The Mexican Garter Snakes we studied ate prey items mostly fish, followed in lesser amounts, respectively, by leeches, earthworms, frogs, and tadpoles. Correspondence analysis suggested that the frequency of consumption of various prey items differed between the categories of age and sex of snakes, and the general pattern was a reduction of prey item diversity with size of snake. Snake length was correlated positively with mass of ingested prey. Large snakes consumed large prey and continued to consume smaller prey. In general, no differences were found between the prey taxa of male and female snakes, although males ate two times more tadpoles than females. Males and females did not differ in the mass of leeches, earthworms, fishes, frogs and tadpoles that they ate, and males and females that ate each prey taxon were similar in length. We discuss proximate and functional determinants of diet and suggest that the observed intraspecific variation in Mexican Garter Snakes could be explored by temporal variation in prey availability, proportions of snake size classes and possible sexual dimorphism in head traits and prey dimensions to assess the role of intersexual resource competition.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2442/', ['Conservation Biology', 'Ecology', 'Zoology'], [u'Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad Aut\xf3noma del Estado de M\xe9xico', u'Divisi\xf3n de Estudios de Posgrado e Investigaci\xf3n, Instituto Tecnol\xf3gico de Ciudad Victoria']]
[u'10 simple rules for designing and analyzing field experiments in ecology', ['Basma Nazal'], u'2016-09-13', u'A set of 10 fundamental rules to successfully design, execute, and analyze biological field experiments. This list tackles the main components of an experiment beginning with the hypothesis and predictions, to the design and execution, as well as statistical analysis and interpretation of data in order for researchers to create the best experimental design for their project. Although this paper is aimed at field experiments in ecology, many of the rules are applicable to other streams of biology.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2441/', ['Biodiversity', 'Ecology', 'Environmental Sciences', 'Marine Biology', 'Plant Science'], [u'Department of Biology, York University']]
[u'Sensitivity of biogeographic reconstructions to the use of differential extinction rates', ['Jose Luis Pinzon'], u'2016-09-12', u'Effects of differential extinction rates remain being an issue in biogeographic and evolutionary studies. Here, I use empirical examples and simulated datasets to asses how the specification of different extinction rates influences ancestral range estimation in historical biogeography. The results showed that variations in scale and asymmetry of extinction rates may have notorious effects in the accuracy of biogeographic inferences, specially when the rates of extinction are high. Further work may explore the behavior of current statistical methods of biogeographic inference with different estimates of extinction based on novel developments in this field.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2440/', ['Biogeography', 'Conservation Biology'], [u'Escuela de Biolog\xeda, Universidad Industrial de Santander']]
[u'Reanalyzing Head et al. (2015): Investigating the robustness of widespread p-hacking', ['Chris H Hartgerink'], u'2016-09-12', u'Head et al. (2015b) provided a large collection of p-values that, from their analytic perspective, indicates widespread statistical significance seeking (i.e., p-hacking). This paper inspects this result for robustness. They correctly argue that an aggregate p-value distribution could show a bump below .05 when left-skew p-hacking occurs frequently. Theoretically, the p-value distribution should be a smooth, decreasing function, but the distribution of reported p-values shows systematically more reported p-values for .01, .02, .03, .04, and .05. Moreover, the elimination of p = .045 and p = .05, as done in the original paper, is debatable. Given that systematically more p-values are reported to two decimal places and the disputable selection of the bins .04 < p < .045 versus .045 < p < .05, I did not exclude p = .045 and p = .05, and I adjusted the bin selection to .03875 < p \u2264 .04 versus .04875 < p \u2264 .05. Results of the reanalysis indicate that no evidence for left-skew p-hacking remains when we take into account a second-decimal reporting tendency. Taking into account reporting tendencies is especially important because this dataset does not allow for the recalculation of the p-values. Moreover, given the weight of the findings by Head et al. (2015b), it is important that these findings are robust to choices that can be debated, if the conclusion is to be considered unequivocal. Although no evidence of widespread left-skew p-hacking is found in this reanalysis, this does not mean that there is no p-hacking at all. These results nuance the conclusion by Head et al. (2015b), indicating that the results are not robust and that the evidence for widespread left-skew p-hacking is ambiguous at best.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2439/', ['Science Policy', 'Statistics'], [u'Department of Methodology and Statistics, Tilburg University']]
[u'Comparative genomics of Pseudomonas syringae pathovar tomato reveals novel chemotaxis pathways associated with motility and plant pathogenicity', ['Christopher Clarke', 'Byron W Hayes', 'Brendan J Runde', 'Eric Markel', 'Bryan M Swingle', 'Boris A Vinatzer'], u'2016-09-12', u'The majority of bacterial foliar plant pathogens must invade the apoplast of host plants through points of ingress, such as stomata or wounds, to replicate to high population density and cause disease. How pathogens navigate plant surfaces to locate invasion sites remains poorly understood. Many bacteria use chemical-directed regulation of flagellar rotation, a process known as chemotaxis, to move towards favorable environmental conditions. Chemotactic sensing of the plant surface is a potential mechanism through which foliar plant pathogens home in on wounds or stomata, but chemotactic systems in foliar plant pathogens are not well characterized. Comparative genomics of the plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pathovar tomato (Pto) implicated annotated chemotaxis genes in the recent adaptations of one Pto lineage. We therefore characterized the chemosensory system of Pto. The Pto genome contains two primary chemotaxis gene clusters, che1 and che2. The che2 cluster is flanked by flagellar biosynthesis genes and similar to the canonical chemotaxis gene clusters of other bacteria based on sequence and synteny. Disruption of the primary phosphorelay kinase gene of the che2 cluster, cheA2, eliminated all swimming and surface motility at 21oC but not 28oC for Pto. The che1 cluster is located next to Type IV pili biosynthesis genes but disruption of cheA1 has no observable effect on twitching motility for Pto. Disruption of cheA2 also alters in planta fitness of the pathogen with strains lacking functional cheA2 being less fit in host plants but more fit in a non-host interaction.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2438/', ['Genetics', 'Microbiology', 'Molecular Biology', 'Plant Science'], [u'Plant Pathology, Physiology and Weed Science, Virginia Tech', u'Emerging Pests and Pathogens Research Unit, Robert W.
