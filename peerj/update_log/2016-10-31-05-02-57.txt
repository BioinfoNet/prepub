[u'The piglet case: commensalism as a new category of intraspecific animal relationships', ['Janko Skok'], u'2016-10-30', u'Relationships among organisms are separated into two main categories: interspecific (between species) and intraspecific (within species). Interspecific relationships, termed symbiosis, are considered very diverse, and include protocooperation (+/+; facultative, not obligatory, cooperation) and mutualism (+/+) \u2013 both represent cooperative relationships, antagonism (-/-), agonism (+/-; including parasitism and predation), amensalism (0/-), neutralism (0/0; if it exists in nature at all), and commensalism (+/0). Intraspecific relationships have just two categories: cooperation (+/+) and competition (+/-). Supporting my latest findings on the suckling behaviour of piglets, I propose an extension of the classification for existing intraspecific relationships by adding a new category: commensalism. The present classification fails to define all interactions among members of the same species, as demonstrated by observations of suckling behaviour in domestic pigs.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2563/', ['Animal Behavior', 'Ecology', 'Zoology'], [u'Faculty of Agriculture and Life Sciences, University of Maribor']]
[u'Evolutionary origins of the emergent ST796 clone of vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecium', ['Andrew H Buultjens', 'Margaret M C Lam', 'Susan Ballard', 'Ian R Monk', 'Andrew A Mahony', 'Elizabeth A Grabsch', 'M Lindsay Grayson', 'Stanley Pang', 'Geoffrey W Coombs', 'J Owen Robinson', 'Torsten Seemann', 'Paul D R Johnson', 'Benjamin P Howden', 'Timothy P Stinear'], u'2016-10-30', u'From early 2012, a novel clone of vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecium (assigned the multi locus sequence type ST796) was simultaneously isolated from geographically separate hospitals in south eastern Australia and New Zealand. Here we describe the complete genome sequence of Ef_aus0233, a representative ST796 E. faecium isolate. We used PacBio single molecule real-time sequencing to establish a high quality, fully assembled genome comprising a circular chromosome of 2,888,087 bp and five plasmids. Comparison of Ef_aus0233 to other E. faecium genomes shows Ef_aus0233 is a member of the epidemic hospital-adapted lineage and has evolved from an ST555-like ancestral progenitor by the accumulation or modification of five mosaic plasmids and five putative prophage, acquisition of two cryptic genomic islands, accrued chromosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms and a 80kb region of recombination, also gaining Tn1549 and Tn916, transposons conferring resistance to vancomycin and tetracycline respectively. The genomic dissection of this new clone presented here underscores the propensity of the hospital E. faecium lineage to change, presumably in response to the specialized conditions of hospital and healthcare environments.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2562/', ['Evolutionary Studies', 'Genomics', 'Microbiology', 'Epidemiology', 'Infectious Diseases'], [u'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, University of Melbourne', u'Microbiology Diagnostic Unit, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, University of Melbourne', u'Infectious Diseases Department, Austin Health', u'School of Veterinary and Life Sciences, Murdoch University', u'Department of Microbiology, Fiona Stanley Hospital', u'Department of Infectious Diseases, Fiona Stanley Hospital', u'Department of infectious Diseases, Royal Perth hospital', u'Department of Microbiology, PathWest Laboratory Medicine', u'Victorian Life Sciences Computation Initiative, University of Melbourne', u'Department of Medicine, University of Melbourne']]
