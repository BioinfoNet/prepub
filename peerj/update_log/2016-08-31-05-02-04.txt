[u'The man-machine integration era', ['Daniel Bilar'], u'2016-08-31', u'Through sensor ubiquity, the man-machine integration era is upon us. This integration is taking place in distributed, continuously changing, optimizing/learning, finite precision feedback systems. Security challenges of such systems abound, also due to constantly co-evolving threat actors and changing environments. Are we adequately preparing to defend such systems, and more importantly: how do we ensure they are worth defending?\nThis position paper posits we are ill-prepared, due to perverse incentives affecting methodology, results and foundational corpuses. With respect to the first question, we will corroborate this ill-preparedness in the context of a basic requirement \u2013 situational awareness \u2013 for so-called Moving Target Defenses. We\u2019ll argue that the second question hinges on a deceptively straightforward permanence invariant: The ability to robustly encode the infinite value of a human being in finite precision systems. Here too, we are failing to develop needed toolsets and skills.\nSuccessfully tackling both questions may determine the future winning model of the man-machine integration era; whether we\u2019ll lose the Republic of the People to the People\u2019s Republic.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2402/', ['Human-Computer Interaction', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Autonomous Systems', 'Social Computing'], [u'Information Systems, Norwich University']]
