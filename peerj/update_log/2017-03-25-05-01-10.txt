[u'Neuroethics of death in the United States', ['Mikaela Sifuentes'], u'2017-03-24', u'The search for a universal definition of death is a relatively new objective in human history, framed by complex biological, technological, and socio-political factors. While it is widely understood that \u201clife\u201d and \u201cdeath\u201d describe inverse states of being, what separates these two states has been vigorously debated by scientists, ethicists, and theologians. Far from merely an academic distinction, the definition of death has implications that extend to end-of-life healthcare, organ transplantation, and inheritance law. This review explores the historical and current definitions of death in the United States, the role of technological advances, and the resultant social and legal applications.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2890/', ['Health Policy', 'Neurology', 'Ethical Issues', 'Legal Issues'], [u'Department of Pharmacology, University of Texas Health Science    Center at San Antonio']]
