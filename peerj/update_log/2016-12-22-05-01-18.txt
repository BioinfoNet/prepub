[u'The influence of predator type on \u2018whirling\u2019 defensive behavior of Pholcus ancoralis (Araneae, Pholcidae), a tropical web-building spider', ['Theodore Striegel'], u'2016-12-21', u'Background. The \u2018whirling\u2019 defensive behavior of Pholcus ancoralis (L. Koch, 1865) was studied in a forest and laboratory in Mo\u2019orea, French Polynesia. This behavior involves fast web-borne gyration to dissuade predators and is widespread in the Pholcidae family.\n Methods. Different local predators (Anterhyncium rufipes, Lipinia noctua, and Thorelliola ensifera) were placed in two-chambered systems with P. ancoralis individuals and qualitative data on whirling frequency and duration were obtained.\n Results. Potter wasps (Anterhyncium rufipes) triggered whirling in 50% of trials and moth skinks (Lipinia noctua) triggered whirling in 20% of trials. The average durations of the behavior triggered by each were 853 and 455 seconds, respectively. Pacific horned jumping spiders (Thorelliola ensifera) triggered whirling in 10% of trials with an average duration of only 20 seconds.\n Discussion. Wasps triggered whirling the most frequently and of a long average duration. This has not been seen in other studied pholcids. This difference in predator specificity of whirling may be due to differences in habitat between pholcid species.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2666/', ['Animal Behavior', 'Ecology', 'Entomology'], [u'Department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management, University of California, Berkeley']]
[u'Is there a connection between peptide bond geometry and aminoacid residue conformational preferences?', ['Nicole Balasco', 'Luciana Esposito', 'Luigi Vitagliano'], u'2016-12-21', u'The definition of the structural basis of the conformational preferences of the genetically encoded aminoacid residues is crucial to decipher the physical code of protein folding and would have a huge impact on our understanding of protein structure and function. Indeed, although a large number of computational and experimental investigations have highlighted that the different protein residues show distinct conformational propensities, none of the current hypotheses is able to satisfactorily explain these preferences. In the last decades, we and others have clearly demonstrated that several geometrical parameters of protein backbone (bond angles, peptide bond distortions from planarity, and pyramidalization of the carbonyl carbon atom) are heavily dependent on the local conformation (\u03c6/\u03c8 dihedral angles) [1-8]. Moreover, a correlation between bond distances such as CO and CN has been detected in ultrahigh resolution protein structures [9]. Concerning bond angles, most of these investigations have been focused on the NC\u03b1C (\u03c4) angle, shown to be significantly affected by both \u03c6/\u03c8 dihedral angles. In this framework, we here evaluated the impact of the local geometry on the residues conformational preferences by performing statistical analyses on a dataset of non-redundant protein chains selected from the Protein data Bank (PDB). Our data highlight a clear link between residue conformational preferences and local geometry.\n\nReferences\n\n1. Karplus PA. Protein Sci. 1996; 5:1406-20.\n2.

[u'Mountain colonisation, miniaturisation and ecological evolution in a radiation of direct developing New Guinea Frogs (Choerophryne, Microhylidae)', ['Paul M Oliver', 'Amy Iannella', 'Stephen J Richards', 'Michael S.Y Lee'], u'2016-12-21', u'Aims. Mountain ranges in the tropics are characterised by high levels of localised endemism, often-aberrant evolutionary trajectories, and some of the world\u2019s most diverse regional biotas. Here we investigate the evolution of montane endemism, ecology and body size in a clade of direct-developing frogs (Choerophryne, Microhylidae) from New Guinea. Methods. Phylogenetic relationships were estimated from a mitochondrial molecular dataset using Bayesian and maximum likelihood approaches. Ancestral state reconstruction was used to infer the evolution of elevational distribution, ecology (indexed by male calling height), and body size, and phylogenetically corrected regression was employed to examine the relationships between these three traits. Results. We obtained strong support for a monophyletic lineage comprising the majority of taxa sampled. Within this clade we identified one subclade that appears to have diversified primarily in montane habitats of the Central Cordillera (> 1000 m. a.s.l), with subsequent dispersal to isolated North Papuan Mountains. A second subclade (characterised by moderately to very elongated snouts) appears to have diversified primarily in hill forests (< 1000 m a.s.l.), with inferred independent upwards colonisations of isolated montane habitats, especially in isolated North Papuan Mountains. We found no clear relationship between extremely small body size (adult SVL less than 15mm) and elevation, but a stronger relationship with ecology \u2013 smaller species tend to be more terrestrial.  Conclusions. Orogeny and climatic oscillations have interacted to generate high montane biodiversity in New Guinea via both localised diversification within montane habitats (centric endemism) and periodic dispersal across lowland regions (eccentric endemism). The correlation between extreme miniaturisation and terrestrial habits reflects a general trend in frogs, suggesting that ecological or physiological constraints limit niche usage by miniaturised frogs, even in extremely wet environments such as tropical mountains.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2663/', ['Biodiversity', 'Biogeography', 'Taxonomy'], [u'Division of Ecology and Evolution, Research School of Biology & Centre for Biodiversity Analysis, Australian National University', u'School of Biological Sciences, The University of Adelaide', u'South Australian Museum', u'School of Biological Sciences, Flinders University']]
[u'The burrow morphology of mole crickets (Orthoptera: Gryllotalpidae): terminology and comparisons', ['Edward Baker'], u'2016-12-21', u'Since the publication of Baker (2016) three additional burrow casts, unknown to the author, were located in the Natural History Museum, London (NHM) collection by George Beccaloni. These casts were provisionally identified as Gryllotalpa vineae. In order to establish whether this identification was correct a literature survey of the casts of mole crickets (Orthoptera: Gryllotalpidae) was conducted. Through this process a standardised terminology for mole cricket burrows has been established.\nThe application of eccentricity measurements to burrow structures has identified measurements that can potentially be used to discriminate those species for which suitably detailed burrow descriptions have been made available. It is demonstrated that the eccentricity of the restrictions on either side of the bulb, as well as the eccentricity of the horn opening, are useful diagnostic characters.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2664/', ['Animal Behavior', 'Entomology'], [u'Department of Life Sciences, Natural History Museum']]
[u'The oldest vertebrate trace fossils from Comb Ridge (Bears Ears Region, southeastern Utah)', ['Robert J Gay', 'Xavier A Jenkins', 'Taormina Lepore'], u'2016-12-21', u'Vertebrate trace fossils are common in Upper Triassic deposits across the American southwest. These ichnofauna are dominated by Grallator, Brachycheirotherium, and Pseudotetrasauropus and lack ichnotaxa traditionally considered to be Early Jurassic in age, such as Eubrontes and Anomoepus. While known from Indian Creek and Lisbon Valley, vertebrate trace fossils have not been previously reported from Comb Ridge. This is despite lithostratigraphic work having been conducted at the elsewhere-fossiliferous \u201cBig Indian Rock Beds\u201d at the US Highway 163 roadcut since the 1990s. 2016 fieldwork by the Museums of Western Colorado: Dinosaur Journey recovered two sandstone slabs that had been dislodged from a river channel sand in the Church Rock Member of the Chinle Formation. The slabs preserve the first documented vertebrate trace fossils from Comb Ridge: a single pes impression of the ichnogenus Grallator, and several manus and at least one pes impression of a small archosaur. We tentatively refer this second track set to the ichnogenus Brachychierotherium. Taken together, these specimens provide evidence for a more diverse vertebrate fauna in the Church Rock Member of the Chinle Formation at Comb Ridge than indicated by the body fossil record.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2662/', ['Biogeography', 'Paleontology'], [u'Dinosaur Journey, Museums of Western Colorado', u'College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Arizona State University', u'Raymond M.

[u'Out of place: a study of the mangrove crab Cardisoma carnifex on Mo\u2019orea, French Polynesia', ['Isabel L S Johnson'], u'2016-12-21', u'Background. Invasive plant species pose a significant threat to island biodiversity and ecosystems. Invasive mangrove trees in particular have been shown to be devastating to the shorelines of islands across the Pacific. Previous studies have assumed that the mangrove crab, Cardisoma carnifex, plays a significant role in controlling Rhizophora stylosa mangrove populations on Mo\u2019orea, French Polynesia. Found across East Africa, Indonesia, and the Pacific, C. carnifex\u2019s behavior can change drastically depending on the environment it\u2019s found in.\nMethods. From October-November 2016, a field study was conducted on Mo\u2019orea to assess C. carnifex habitat and food preferences. A series of 30 meter transects were done to determine the population density of crabs in mangrove and non-mangrove sites. In addition, a set of food preference experiments were run to determine if C. carnifex preferred to eat R. stylosa leaves, propagules, Hibiscus tiliaceus leaves, flowers, and Paspalum vaginatum marsh grass.\nResults. Cardisoma carnifex was found to be more prevalent in mangrove sites although the results were not statistically significant. There were no food preferences found regardless of habitat and the flow of food through both habitats was the same.\nDiscussion.  Results do not give a clear indication of C. carnifex\u2019s ability to impact R. stylosa populations. However, results do demonstrate C. carnifex\u2019s opportunistic nature, suggesting that they are extremely adaptable and do not rely on one habitat or food source for survival. Cardisoma carnifex\u2019s role in its habitat is still poorly understood and needs to be studied in more detail in the future.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2660/', ['Ecology', 'Environmental Sciences', 'Marine Biology'], [u'Department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management, University of California, Berkeley']]
[u'Molecular cloning, sequence characteristics, and tissue expression analysis of the SLC35D3 gene in lean, obese and mini-type pigs', ['Wen-tong Li', 'Ying Liu', 'Rong Zhou', 'Ya-lan Yang', 'Yan-min Zhang', 'Hui Tang'], u'2016-12-21', u"Nowadays, with the development of people's life, obesity become one of the largest health problems today. Solute carrier family 35, member D3 (SLC35D3) protein has been reported to be involved in adipose deposition and metabolic control in mice. Because organ size in pig is comparable to that of the human, the pig is an ideal model that has been used to study diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis, obesity, and other diseases. To better understand the structure and function of the SLC35D3 gene, the Meishan pig SLC35D3 gene was cloned and characterized, and its expression in different tissues was determined. The SLC35D3 cDNA consisted of a 1272 bp coding sequence that encoded a protein of 243 amino acids with a molecular mass of 44653.9 Da, and 966 bp 3\u2032 untranslated regions. It is a pity that we have not got 5\u2032 untranslated regions. Phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that porcine SLC35D3 had a closer genetic relationship and a shorter evolutionary distance with Vicugna; however, its evolutionary distance with that of the gorilla was longer than that of Vicugna. In addition, we quantified the SLC35D3 mRNA level by real-time polymerase chain reaction and detected expression in the liver, kidney, lung, heart, brain, LM, and spleen, as well as in the leaf lard, SAT, and PAT. In addition, we also tested the expression level of Meishan, Bama and Yorkshire in adipose tissue. The SLC35D3 mRNA level was highest in the leaf lard. These results serve as a foundation for further study on the porcine SLC35D3 gene.", u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2661/', ['Bioinformatics', 'Genetics'], [u'College of animal science and technology, Shandong Agricultural University', u'Institute of Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences']]
