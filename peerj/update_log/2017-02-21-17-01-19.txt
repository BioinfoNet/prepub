[u'MerCat: a versatile k-mer counter and diversity estimator for database-independent property analysis obtained from metagenomic and/or metatranscriptomic sequencing data', ['Richard Allen White III', 'Ajay Panyala', 'Kevin Glass', 'Sean Colby', 'Kurt R Glaesemann', 'Christer Jansson', 'Janet K Jansson'], u'2017-02-21', u'MerCat (\u201c Mer - Cat enate\u201d) is a parallel, highly scalable and modular property software package for robust analysis of features in next-generation sequencing data. Using assembled contigs and raw sequence reads from any platform as input, MerCat performs k-mer counting of any length k, resulting in feature abundance counts tables. MerCat allows for direct analysis of data properties without reference sequence database dependency commonly used by search tools such as BLAST for compositional analysis of whole community shotgun sequencing (e.g., metagenomes and metatranscriptomes).', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2825/', ['Bioinformatics', 'Computational Biology', 'Data Science', 'Scientific Computing and Simulation', 'Software Engineering'], [u'Biological Sciences Division, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL)', u'Infomation technology, High Performance Computing (HPC) and Cloud Services, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL)', u'Environmental and Molecular Sciences Laboratory (EMSL), Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL)']]
