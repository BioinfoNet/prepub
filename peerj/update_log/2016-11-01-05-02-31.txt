[u'Barriers to the use of personal health records by patients: A structured review', ['Chris Showell'], u'2016-11-01', u'Introduction: \n\nAn increasing focus on personal electronic health records (PHRs) offers healthcare benefits for patients, particularly those in undeserved and marginalised populations, who are at risk of receiving less effective healthcare, and may have worse health outcomes. However, PHRs are likely to favour text, technical and health literate users, and be less suitable for disadvantaged patients. These concerns have prompted this review of the literature, which seeks evidence about barriers to the adoption and continued use of PHRs, the nature of the evidence for those barriers, and the stage of PHR implementation where particular barriers apply.\n\nMethods: \n\nSearches in PubMed, Embase, CINAHL and ProQuest databases were used to retrieve articles published in English after 2003 in a refereed journal or presented in a refereed conference or scientific meeting. After screening to remove items which were out of scope, the phase of the PHR implementation, the type of investigation, and PHR barriers were categorised using thematic coding.\n\nResults: \n\nThe search retrieved 439 items; screening identified 40 in-scope publications, which provided evidence of 21 identified barriers to patient adoption and continued use of PHRs, categorised here as Individual, Demographic, Capability, Health-related, PHR or Attitudinal factors. Barriers were identified in most phases of PHR implementation, and in most types of study. A secondary outcome identified that eleven of the publications may have introduced a bias by excluding participants who were less affluent, less capable, or marginalised.\n\nConclusions: \n\nPHR barriers can interfere with the decision to start using a PHR, with the adoption process, and with continued use, and the impact of particular barriers may vary at different phases of PHR adoption. The complex interrelationships which exist between many of the barriers is suggested in some publications, and emerges more clearly from this review. Many PHR barriers appear to be related to low socioeconomic status. A better understanding is needed of how the effect of barriers is manifested, how that that effect can be countered, and how planning and implementation of PHR initiatives can make allowance for patient level barriers to PHR adoption and use, with appropriate actions to mitigate the effect of those barriers for more disadvantaged patients.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2567/', ['Health Policy', 'Public Health', 'Human-Computer Interaction'], [u'eHealth Services Research Group, University of Tasmania']]
[u'Scientific data science and the case for Open Access', ['Gopal P Sarma'], u'2016-11-01', u'\u201cOpen access\u201d has become a central theme of journal reform in academic publishing. In this article, I examine the consequences of an important technological loophole in which publishers can claim to be adhering to the principles of open access by releasing articles in proprietary or \u201clocked\u201d formats that cannot be processed by automated tools, whereby even simple copy and pasting of text is disabled. These restrictions will prevent the development of an important infrastructural element of a modern research enterprise, namely, scientific data science, or the use of data analytic techniques to conduct meta-analyses and investigations into the scientific corpus. I give a brief history of the open access movement, discuss novel journalistic practices, and an overview of data-driven investigation of the scientific corpus. I argue that particularly in an era where the veracity of many research studies has been called into question, scientific data science should be one of the key motivations for open access publishing. The enormous benefits of unrestricted access to the research literature should prompt scholars from all disciplines to reject publishing models whereby articles are released in proprietary formats or are otherwise restricted from being processed by automated tools as part of a data science pipeline.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2566/', ['Bioinformatics', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Health Policy', 'Translational Medicine', 'Science Policy'], [u'School of Medicine, Emory University']]
[u'Prediction of pKa values for drug-like molecules using semiempirical quantum chemical methods', ['Jan H. Jensen'], u'2016-11-01', u'Rapid yet accurate pKa prediction for drug-like molecules is a key challenge in computational chemistry. This study uses PM6-DH+/COSMO, PM6/COSMO, PM7/COSMO, PM3/COSMO, AM1/COSMO, PM3/SMD, AM1/SMD, and DFTB3/SMD to predict the pKa values of 53 amine groups in 48 drug-like compounds. The approach uses an isodesmic reaction where the pKa value is computed relative to a chemically related reference compound for which the pKa value has been measured experimentally or estimated using a standard empirical approach. The AM1- and PM3-based methods perform best with RMSE values of 1.4 - 1.6 pH units that have uncertainties of 0.3-0.4 pH units, which make them statistically equivalent. However, for all but PM3/SMD and AM1/SMD the RMSEs are dominated by a single outlier, cefadoxil, caused by proton transfer in the zwitterionic protonation state. If this outlier is removed, the RMSE values for PM3/COSMO and AM1/COSMO drop to 1.0 \xb1 0.2 and 1.1 \xb1 0.3, while PM3/SMD and AM1/SMD remain at 1.5 \xb1 0.4 and 1.6 \xb1 0.4 pH units, making the COSMO-based predictions statistically better than the SMD-based predictions. So for pKa calculations where a zwitterionic state is not involved or proton transfer in a zwitterionic state is not observed then PM3/COSMO or AM1/COSMO is the best pKa prediction method, otherwise PM3/SMD or AM1/SMD should be used. Thus, fast and relatively accurate pKa prediction for 100-1000s of drug-line amines is feasible with the current setup and relatively modest computational resources.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2564/', ['Biophysics', 'Computational Biology'], [u'Department of  Chemistry, University of Copenhagen']]
[u'Comprehensive family-based SNV association analysis shows new alleles associated to mealy traits in Prunus persica', ['Paula Vizoso', 'Claudio Meneses', 'Reinaldo Campos', 'Ariel Orellana'], u'2016-11-01', u'Identification of DNA markers associated with mealiness trait is an important tool to agricultural industry. Many peach breeding initiatives have as aim to improve early selection of varieties with better postharvest performance. We present a family-based approach to identify and develop an association panel to evaluate potential varieties susceptible to mealiness induced by chilling. We used whole-genome sequencing and SNV genotyping of parents and ten contrasting siblings (Juicy and mealy) obtained from segregating population of self-cross \u2018Venus\u2019. Results show that there are differences regarding SNVs and structural variants (SVs) that could be associated with mealy to be contrasted with individuals without such damage phenotype. Preliminary results showed a total of 30.564 SNVs and 2.297 SVs having a non-synonymous change in genes. Comparison of SNVs between segregants and parental revealed 1.963 SNVs associated genes presents in juicy segregants and 6.162 SNVs associated genes in segregants mealiness. We found 230 and 244 SVs with functional impact in genomes mealy and juicy. As proof of concept, all SNVs obtained were correlated with the information published in peach related to chilling injury (QTL genomic region, dbSNP, SDR chillpeach, upeach and RNA-seq available). Guided by preliminary analysis, we selected pools of alleles that display a frequency difference between mealy and juicy fruit and a selective sweep is observed around those alleles. Some of the SNVs have been previously correlated with chilling injury through transcriptome analysis. Additionally, we identify new genome regions associated with mealy susceptibility. Most of these genes were related to negative regulation of programmed cell death, cell surface receptors signaling pathways and cell wall remodeling. On the other hand, the genes affected by SV in the juicy segregating are classified according to the biological process in metabolism of sugars and fatty acid biosynthetic process. These results provide insights into genetics determinants related with susceptibility to mealiness. Analysis of the sequences revealed the existence of a high polymorphism rate in nectarines, and statistical analysis showed that the segments could be used as genetic barcodes that should be informative enough to allow reliable identification of cultivars. This study proposes a predictive panel of biomarkers to identify varieties at susceptible for mealiness and identifies new candidates genes linked to mealiness in peach.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2565/', ['Bioinformatics', 'Computational Biology'], [u'Centro de Biotecnolog\xeda Vegetal, Universidad Nacional Andr\xe9s Bello.']]
