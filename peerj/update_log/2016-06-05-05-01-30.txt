[u'Development of a bacterial culture medium from avocado seed waste', ['Olivia Tzintzun-Camacho', 'Lino Sanchez-Segura', 'Alexis Z Minchaca-Acosta', 'Luis M Rosales-Colunga', 'Ana L Hernandez-Orihuela', 'Agustino Martinez-Antonio'], u'2016-06-04', u'Avocado (Persea americana Mill) seeds, a rich source of starch and micronutrients, are a major waste product from the agroindustrial processing of avocados. Here we designed and developed an experimental culture medium (ECM) from hydrolysed avocado seeds, supplemented with M9 salts (10% v/v). Breaking of starch granules of avocado seeds due to hydrolysis treatments was analysed by morphology and morphometry of granules. We evaluated the ECM functionality by measuring the growth of Escherichia coli as affected by (i) the carbon source (reducing sugars concentration), (ii) the nitrogen source, and (iii) mixing and aeration in a stirred tank bioreactor. ECM containing 13.33 and 20 g/L of reducing sugars reached a biomass production of 1.75 and 2.22 gDCW/L, respectively. The biomass yield from ECM was at least 2.5-fold higher than that obtained using Luria-Bertani Broth (LB) medium (0.23 vs 0.09). In addition, the growth rate increased with the agitation velocity (0.44 h-1 at 200 rpm; 0.36 h-1 at 150 rpm). Our findings suggest that avocado seeds represent a cost-effective material for producing a sustainable culture medium for bacterial growth of E. coli and other strains of interest in biotechnological processes.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2104/', ['Agricultural Science', 'Biotechnology', 'Microbiology', 'Plant Science'], [u'Genetic Engineering, CINVESTAV Irapuato']]
[u'Automation in clinical data collection in obstetrics - Enabling pooled IPD studies for fetal heart rate and activity monitoring', ['Christopher Weber', 'Maximilian Saalfeld', 'Christian Harboeck', 'Silvia M Lobmaier', 'Joy Weyrich', 'Holger J Grundmann', 'Martin Daumer'], u'2016-06-03', u'Cardiotocography is currently the standard surveillance tool during labour. For this reason, there are large cardiotography datasets available. Several studies gathering additional information of computerized CTG data aiming to improve surveillance during delivery and birth outcome are currently performed. Manual data collection and analysis takes a lot of human resources, is error-prone and study parameters can hardly be adjusted later on. Therefore, a software based approach was chosen to minimize the effort of preparation. The software called \u201cCTG and patient information matcher\u201d (CAPIM) collects relevant CTG signals for a specified patient dataset and under recognition of several parameters. CAPIM was tested with the patient database of Frauenklinik und Poliklinik of Technische Universit\xe4t M\xfcnchen (Munich, Germany). Further hospitals will follow. The cases received from CAPIM will be used to do feasibility studies for two innovative signal processing techniques as \u201ephase-rectified signal averaging\u201c method on fe\xadtal heart rate raw data and \u201edeceleration area\u201c me\xadthod to improve prediction of birth outcome.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2098/', ['Bioinformatics', 'Computational Biology', 'Data Mining and Machine Learning', 'Data Science', 'Software Engineering'], [u'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Technische Universit\xe4t M\xfcnchen', u'Trium Analysis Online GmbH', u'Frauenklinik und Poliklinik, Technische Universit\xe4t M\xfcnchen', u'SLC e.V. - The Human Motion Institute']]
