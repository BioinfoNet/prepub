[u'Are coupled file changes suggestions useful?', ['Jasmin Ramadani', 'Stefan Wagner'], u'2016-09-30', u'Background. Software maintenance is an important activity in the process of software engineering where over time maintenance team members leave and new members join. The identification of files being changes together frequently has been proposed several times. Yet, existing studies about these file changes ignore the feedback from developers as well as the impact on the performance of maintenance and rely on the analysis findings and expert evaluation.\nMethods. We conducted an experiment with the goal to investigate the usefulness of coupled file changes during maintenance tasks when developers are inexperienced in programming or when they are new on the project. Using data mining on software repositories we can identify files that changed most frequently together in the past. We extract coupled file changes from the Git repository of a Java software system and join them with corresponding attributes from the versioning and issue tracking system and the project documentation. We present a controlled experiment involving 36 student participants where we investigate if coupled file change suggestions influence the correctness of the task solutions and the time to complete them.\nResults. The results show that coupled file change suggestions significantly increase the correctness of the solutions. However, there is only a small effect on the time to complete the tasks. We also derived a set of the most useful attributes based on the developers feedback.\nDiscussion. Coupled file changes and a limited number of the proposed attributes are useful for inexperienced developers working on maintenance tasks whereby although the developers using these suggestions solved more tasks, they still need time to organize and understand and implement this information.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2492/', ['Data Science', 'Software Engineering'], [u'Institute of Software Technology, University of Stuttgart']]
[u'Development and characterization of 29 polymorphic microsatellite loci of Megalobrama pellegrini by next-generation sequencing technology and cross-species amplification in related species', ['Wen Song', 'Dongmei Zhu', 'Yefeng Lv', 'Weimin Wang'], u'2016-09-30', u'Megalobrama pellegrini is one of the economically important freshwater fish in China. Here, we developed 29 polymorphic microsatellite loci of M. pellegrini. The number of alleles (Na), effective number of alleles (Ne), observed heterozygosity (HO), expected heterozygosity (HE) and polymorphic information content (PIC) ranged from 3 to 11 (mean\xb1SD 5.4828\xb11.9571), 2.8708 to 9.6257 (mean\xb1SD 5.0865\xb11.6681), 0.4333 to 0.9333 (mean\xb1SD 0.7874\xb10.1213), 0.6627 to 0.9113 (mean\xb1SD 0.7946\xb10.0751) and 0.5785 to 0.8868 (mean\xb1SD 0.7439\xb10.0950), respectively. Cross-species amplification was successful at most loci for related species such as M. amblycephala, M. hoffmanni, M. skolkovii and Parabramis pekinensis. The transferability rate of the 29 polymorphic microsatellite markers in M. amblycephala, M. hoffmanni, M. skolkovii and P. pekinensis were 96.55%, 86.21%, 86.21% and 75.86%, respectively. These polymorphic microsatellites are not only useful in genetic study and conservation of M. pellegrini, but also an effective tool for identifying the related species. We could use 5 microsatellite markers (HHF-63, HHF-104, HHF-113, HHF-148, HHF-163) to distinguish the 5 species.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2490/', ['Aquaculture, Fisheries and Fish Science', 'Genetics'], [u'Key Lab of Agricultural Animal Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction of Ministry of Education, Key Lab of Freshwater Animal Breeding, Ministry of Agriculture, Huazhong Agricutural University']]
[u'Genetic analysis of behavior in Drosophila', ['Bjorn Brembs'], u'2016-09-30', u'The main function of brains is to generate adaptive behavior. Far from being the stereotypical, robot-like insect, the fruit fly Drosophila exhibits astounding flexibility and chooses different courses of actions even under identical external circumstances. Due to the power of genetics, we now are beginning to understand the neuronal mechanisms underlying this behavioral flexibility. Interestingly, the evidence from studies of disparate behaviors converges on common organizational principles common to many if not all behaviors, such as modified sensory processing, involvement of biogenic amines in network remodeling, ongoing activity and modulation by feedback. Seemingly foreseeing these recent insights, already the first research fields in Drosophila behavioral neurogenetics reflected this constant negotiation between internal and external demands on the animal as the common mechanism underlying adaptive behavioral choice in Drosophila.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2491/', ['Animal Behavior', 'Genetics', 'Neuroscience', 'Zoology'], [u'Institute of Zoology - Neurogenetics, Universit\xe4t Regensburg']]
[u'Tet(C) gene transfer between Chlamydia suis strains occurs by homologous recombination after co-infection: Implications for spread of tetracycline-resistance among Chlamydiaceae', ['Hanna Marti', 'Hoyon Kim', 'Sandeep Joseph', 'Stacey S Dojiri', 'Timothy Read', 'Deborah Dean'], u'2016-09-30', u'Chlamydia suis is a swine pathogen that also causes zoonotic infections. Many strains contain a tet(C) cassette conferring tetracycline resistance originally acquired by horizontal gene transfer from a Gram-negative donor. As we and others have described the capacity for Chlamydiaceae to exchange DNA by homologous recombination, tet(C)-containing C. suis strains represent a potential source for antibiotic-resistance spread within and between Chlamydia species. Here, we examine the genetics of tet(C)-transfer among C. suis strains. Tetracycline-sensitive C. suis strain S45 was simultaneously or sequentially co-infected with tetracycline-resistant C. suis strains in McCoy cells. Potential recombinants were clonally purified by plaque assay. C. suis strain Rogers132, which lacks IS200/IS605 transposases, was the most efficient donor, producing three confirmed recombinants of 56 (5.4%) clones with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ~8\xb5g/mL. Resistance was stable when recombinants were grown initially in tetracycline at twice the MIC of S45 (0.032 \xb5g/mL). Genomic analysis revealed that tet(C) had integrated into the S45 genome by homologous recombination at two sites in different recombinants: a 55kb exchange between nrqF and pckG, and a 175kb exchange between kdsA and cysQ. Neither site was associated with repeats or motifs associated with recombination hotspots. Our findings show that cassette transfer into S45 has low frequency, does not require IS200/IS605 transposases, is stable if initially grown in tetracycline, and results in multiple genomic configurations. We provide a model for stable cassette transfer to better understand the capability for cassette acquisition by Chlamydia species that infect humans, a matter of public health importance.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2489/', ['Cell Biology', 'Genomics', 'Microbiology', 'Molecular Biology', 'Infectious Diseases'], [u"Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute, UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland", u'Department of Infectious Diseases and Genetics, Emory University']]
[u'The outcomes of most aggressive interactions among closely related bird species are asymmetric', ['Paul R Martin', 'Cameron Freshwater', 'Cameron K Ghalambor'], u'2016-09-30', u'Aggressive interactions among closely related species are common. These can play an important role as a selective pressure shaping species, traits and assemblages. The nature of this selective pressure depends on whether the outcomes of aggressive contests are asymmetric between species (i.e., one species is consistently dominant), yet few studies have estimated the prevalence of asymmetric versus symmetric outcomes to aggressive contests. Here we use previously published data involving 26,656 interactions between 270 species pairs of birds from 26 taxonomic families to address the question: How often are aggressive interactions among closely related bird species asymmetric? We define asymmetry using (i) the proportion of contests won by one species, and (ii) statistical tests for asymmetric outcomes of aggressive contests. We calculate these asymmetries using data summed across different sites for each species pair, and compare results to asymmetries calculated using data separated by location. We find that 80% of species pairs had aggressive outcomes where one species won 80% or more of aggressive contests. We also find that the majority of aggressive interactions among closely related species show statistically significant asymmetries, and above a sample size of 52 interactions, all outcomes are asymmetric following binomial tests. Results using data partitioned by location showed similar patterns. Species pairs with dominance data from multiple sites showed the same dominance relationship across locations in 93% of the species pairs. Overall, our results suggest that the outcome of aggressive interactions among closely related species are usually consistent and asymmetric, and should thus favor ecological and evolutionary strategies specific to the position of a species within a dominance hierarchy.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2488/', ['Animal Behavior', 'Ecology', 'Evolutionary Studies', 'Zoology'], [u"Department of Biology, Queen's University", u'Department of Biology, University of Victoria', u'Department of Biology and Graduate Degree Program in Ecology, Colorado State University']]
[u'First visual record of rare purple dogwhelks (Nucella lapillus) on the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia, Canada', ['Sonja M. Ehlers', 'Julius A. Ellrich'], u'2016-09-30', u'The dogwhelk Nucella lapillus is a rocky intertidal gastropod of the North Atlantic coast. Individual shell color varies. Common colors range between white and brown, with darker dogwhelks being more affected by heat stress than lighter-colored conspecifics. Other reported shell colors are black, mauve, pink, yellow, and orange from European coasts, red and grey from the Bay of Fundy coast of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia (Canada), and purple, black, gray, yellow, and orange from the coasts of Maine and Massachusetts (USA), with purple being considered as a rare color. On the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia, dogwhelks are active from April until November, but information on dogwhelk shell color is missing for this coast. On 16 June 2016, we found two purple dogwhelks in the mid-to-high intertidal zone of a moderately wave-exposed rocky shore near Duncans Cove, on the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia while collecting dogwhelks (n= 1000) for manipulative field experiments. All other dogwhelks collected on that day were of common white and brown colors. During earlier dogwhelk collections in Atlantic Nova Scotia (between 2011-2013) and field surveys in Duncans Cove (between 2014-2016), we did not find any purple dogwhelks, indicating the rareness of this color in that region. Interestingly, the purple dogwhelks were detected on a relatively cool day (12.3 \xb1 0.4 \xb0C, mean \xb1 se, n= 96 temperature measurements) compared to the intertidal temperatures of all other survey days (\u2265 18.2 \xb1 0.5 \xb0C), suggesting that purple dogwhelks may find it less thermally stressful to venture out of crevices and macroalgal cover under relatively cool temperatures.
