Urgiles', 'Juan Carlos Sanchez-Nivicela', 'Diego F Cisneros-Heredia'], u'2017-01-08', u'We present new information on the distribution of the marsupial frog Gastrotheca testudinea (Jim\xe9nez de la Espada, 1870) in Ecuador. We provide the first record from the province of Ca\xf1ar, and the country\u2019s southernmost locality (which also corresponds to the third known report from the province of Zamora-Chinchipe). In addition, we discuss the validity of the locality of Loreto for this species. Based on this discussion, we review the elevation range of the species and propose to change the lowest elevation limit of Gastrotheca testudinea from 1100 to 700 m.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2710/', ['Biodiversity', 'Biogeography', 'Zoology'], [u'Museo de Zoolog\xeda, Laboratorio de Herpetolog\xeda, Universidad del Azuay', u'Divisi\xf3n de Herpetolog\xeda, Instituto Nacional de Biodiversidad, Museo Ecuatoriano de Ciencias Naturales', u'Colegio de Ciencias Biol\xf3gicas y Ambientales COCIBA, Laboratorio de Zoolog\xeda Terrestre, Universidad San Francisco de Quito', u"Department of Geography, King's College London, University of London"]]
[u'Inhibition of Nf-\u049db prevents trauma-induced heterotopic ossification in rat model', ['Jinyong Ju', 'Du Yu', 'Feng Xue', 'Yong Zhao', 'Weizhe Shi', 'Mingmang Pan', 'Guo Tang', 'Haijun Xiao'], u'2017-01-08', u'Background. To find a better prophylactic regimen, the pathogenesis of acquired heterotopic ossification (AHO) must be more understood. To date, AHO formation is largely thought to be related to inflammation, which is activated by trauma, resulting in AHO by up-regulation of pro-osteogenic genes. Methods. Brain-traumatic/burn/tenotomy model is firstly used in experiment. At first, 44 rats were randomly divided into two groups: E group and C group. Two rats in every group were euthanized during second, third, fourth, sixth, eighth, tenth weeks for collecting tendon. The remaining rats survived until tenth week for X-Ray radiation examination to confirm the size of AHO.Then, 124 rats were randomly divided into four group: P group, L group, M group, H group. The three rats of every group were euthanized during every week of the first seven weeks for collecting tendon to detect P65 protein. The remaining rats survived until tenth week for X-Ray examination to confirm the size of AHO. Results. The success rate of Brain-traumatic/Burn/Tenotomy model is 100%. Difference of P65 expression in E group and in C group are statistically significant,and that in E group is higher.Pharmacologic inhibition of Nf-\u049db signaling pathway limits AHO formation, and that The bone formation content of M group is decreased. Conclusion. Brain-traumatic/Burn/Tenotomy model is highly reliable.Results indicate that the Nf-\u049db /p65 signaling response occurs in the forming process of AHO. PDTC limits formation of AHO. The most effective concentration is 6mg/ml for local injection.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2709/', ['Orthopedics'], [u'Department of Orthopaedics, Department of Orthopaedics,Fenxian District Central Hospital Graduate Training Base,Jinzhou Medical University', u'Department of Orthopaedics, Fenxian District Central Hospital']]
[u'Investigation of Diadema savignyi\u2019s role in shaping the abundance of the brown microalga, Sargassum Pacificum, in Mo\u2019orea, French Polynesia', ['Valerie R Bednarski'], u'2017-01-08', u'The role of Diadema savignyi in controlling the brown microalga, Sargassum pacificum, was studied on the barrier reef of Mo\u2019orea, French Polynesia. A survey of the area was conducted to determine if there was a trend between the number of D. savignyi and the amount of S. pacificum on a coral bommie; no correlation was found. A field experiment involved relocating D. savignyi by placing groups of seven on coral bommies in the backreef outside of Cooks Bay. At the end of the experiment, Sargassum pacificum cover was compared in urchin manipulated coral bommies and non-manipulated bommies. Manipulated bommies experienced a statistically greater decrease in S. pacificum cover. However, the control bommies experienced almost no change, indicating that the increased density of urchins on a bommie caused an increased feeding rate.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2708/', ['Aquaculture, Fisheries and Fish Science', 'Biodiversity', 'Ecology', 'Ecosystem Science', 'Marine Biology'], [u'Department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management, University of California, Berkeley']]
