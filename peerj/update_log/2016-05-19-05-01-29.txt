[u'Pacing during an ultramarathon running event in hilly terrain', ['Hugo A Kerherve', 'Tom Cole-Hunter', 'Aaron N Wiegand', 'Colin Solomon'], u'2016-05-18', u'Purpose. The dynamics of speed selection as a function of distance, or pacing, are used in recreational, competitive, and scientific research situations as an indirect measure of the psycho-physiological status of an individual. The purpose of this study was to determine pacing on level, uphill and downhill sections of participants in a long (~173 km) ultramarathon performed on trails in hilly terrain. Methods. Fifteen ultramarathon runners competed in a ~173 km event (five finished at ~103 km) carrying a Global-Positioning System (GPS) device. Using the GPS data, we determined the speed, relative to average total speed, in level (LEV), uphill (UH) and downhill (DH) gradient categories as a function of total distance, as well as the correlation between overall performance and speed variability, speed loss, and total time stopped. Results. There were no significant differences in normality, variances or means in the relative speed in 173-km and 103-km participants. Relative speed decreased in LEV, UH and DH. The main component of speed loss occurred between 5% and 50% of the event distance in LEV, and between 5% and 95% in UH and DH. There were no significant correlations between overall performance and speed loss, the variability of speed, or total time stopped. Conclusions. Positive pacing was observed at all gradients, with the main component of speed loss occurring earlier (mixed pacing) in LEV compared to UH and DH. A speed reserve (increased speed in the last section) was observed in LEV and UH. The decrease in speed and variability of speed were more important in LEV and DH than in UH. The absence of a significant correlation between overall performance and descriptors of pacing is novel and indicates that pacing in ultramarathons in trails and hilly terrain differs to other types of running events.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2050/', ['Kinesiology'], [u'Laboratoire Interuniversitaire de Biologie de la Motricit\xe9, Universit\xe9 Savoie Mont Blanc', u'School of Health and Sport Sciences, University of the Sunshine Coast', u'Centre for Research in Environmental Epidemiology', u'School of Science and Engineering, University of the Sunshine Coast']]
[u'Intertwining phylogenetic trees and networks', ['Klaus Schliep', 'Alastair Alastair Potts', 'David A Morrison', 'Guido W Grimm'], u'2016-05-18', u'The fields of phylogenetic tree and network inference have dramatically advanced in the last decade, but independently with few attempts to bridge them. Here we provide a framework, implemented in the phangorn library in R, to transfer information between trees and networks. This includes: 1) identifying and labelling equivalent tree branches and network edges, 2) transferring branch support to network edges, and 3) mapping bipartition support from a sample of trees (e.g. from bootstrapping or Bayesian inference) onto network edges. The ability to readily combine tree and network information should lead to more comprehensive evolutionary comparisons and conclusions.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2054/', ['Computational Biology', 'Evolutionary Studies'], [u'University of Massachusetts Boston', u'Botany Department, Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University', u'Systematic Biology, Uppsala University', u'University of Vienna']]
[u'Percentile curves for peripheral and truncal skinfold thickness for Canadian children and youth', ['Stefan Kuhle', 'Jillian Ashley-Martin', 'Bryan Maguire', 'David C Hamilton'], u'2016-05-18', u'Background: Skinfold thickness (SFT) measurements are a reliable and feasible method for assessing body fat in children but their use and interpretation is hindered by the scarcity of reference values in representative populations of children. The objectives of the present study were to develop age- and sex-specific percentile curves for five SFT measures (biceps, triceps, subscapular, suprailiac, medial calf) and to describe body fat composition in a representative population of Canadian children and youth. Methods: We analyzed data from 3938 children and adolescents between 6 and 19 years of age who participated in the Canadian Health Measures Survey cycles 1 (2007/2009) and 2 (2009/2011). Standardized procedures were used to measure SFT. Age- and sex-specific centiles for skinfolds and body fat were calculated using the GAMLSS method. Results: Percentile curves were materially different in absolute value and shape for boys and girls. Percentile girls in girls steadily increased with age whereas percentile curves in boys were characterized by a pubertal centered peak. Median body fat percentage at age 18 was 13.2 and 25.4% among boys and girls, respectively. Conclusions: The current study has presented for the first time percentile curves for five SFT measures and body fat in a representative sample of Canadian children and youth.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2053/', ['Epidemiology', 'Nutrition', 'Pediatrics', 'Public Health', 'Statistics'], [u'Departments of Pediatrics and Obstetrics & Gynaecology, Dalhousie University', u'Department of Mathematics & Statistics, Dalhousie University']]
[u'Order and Metric Compatible Symbolic Sequence Processing', ['Daniel J Greenhoe'], u'2016-05-18', u'A traditional random variable X is a function that maps from a stochastic process to the real line (X,<=,d,+,.), where R is the set of real numbers, <= is the standard linear order relation on R, d(x,y)=|x-y| is the usual metric on R, and (R, +, .) is the standard field on R. Greenhoe(2015b) has demonstrated that this definition of random variable is often a poor choice for computing statistics when the stochastic process that X maps from has structure that is dissimilar to that of the real line. Greenhoe(2015b) has further proposed an alternative statistical system, that rather than mapping a stochastic process to the real line, instead maps to a weighted graph that has order and metric geometry structures similar to that of the underlying stochastic process. In particular, ideally the structure X maps from and the structure X maps to are, with respect to each other, both isomorphic and isometric.Mapping to a weighted graph is useful for analysis of a single random variable.for example the expectation EX of X can be defined simply as the center of its weighted graph. However, the mapping has limitations with regards to a sequence of random variables in performing sequence analysis (using for example Fourier analysis or wavelet analysis), in performing sequence processing (using for example FIR filtering or IIR filtering), in making diagnostic measurements (using a post-transform metric space), or in making \x81goptimal\x81h decisions (based on \x81gdistance\x81h measurements in a metric space or more generally a distance space). Rather than mapping to a weighted graph, this paper proposes instead mapping to an ordered distance linear space Y=(R^n,<=,d,+,.,R,+,x), where (R,+,x) is a field, + is the vector addition operator on R^n x R^n, and . is the scalar-vector multiplication operator on R x R^n. The linear space component of Y provides a much more convenient (as compared to the weighted graph) framework for sequence analysis and processing. The ordered set and distance space components of Y allow one to preserve the order structure and distance geometry inherent in the underlying stochastic process, which in turn likely provides a less distorted (as compared to the real line) framework for analysis, diagnostics, and optimal decision making.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2052/', ['Bioinformatics', 'Computational Biology', 'Data Mining and Machine Learning', 'Data Science'], [u'National Chiao Tung University']]
