[u'Events recovery under different methods', ['Karen Mendez', 'Daniel Miranda-Esquivel'], u'2016-09-07', u'To reconstruct the biogeographic history should be taken into account the processes involved in the current distribution of the biota, for example vicariance, dispersal, sympatry and extinction. Different methods have been created to answer this. From methods to detect only vicariant events to ancestral area analysis under different models where all events are considered to reconstruct the history at individual level and from which analyze if there are congruence with other taxonomic groups, methods based on cells, endemism areas, parsimony, parametric methods, in general there is a great variety of methods. All have a different approach to determine the amount and the location of the event in the phylogeny but all can give a resolution of how have been created this patterns of distribution.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2428/', ['Biogeography'], [u'Universidad Industrial de Santander']]
