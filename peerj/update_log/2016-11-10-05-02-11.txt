[u'pathVar: a new method for pathway-based interpretation of gene expression variability', ['Laurence de Torrente', 'Samuel Zimmerman', 'Deanne Taylor', 'Yu Hasegawa', 'Christine A Wells', 'Jessica C Mar'], u'2016-11-09', u'Identifying the pathways that control a cellular phenotype is the first step to building a mechanistic model. Recent examples in developmental biology, cancer genomics, and neurological disease have demonstrated how changes in the variability of gene expression can highlight important genes that are under different degrees of regulatory control. Simple statistical tests exist to identify differentially-variable genes; however, methods for investigating how changes in gene expression variability in the context of pathways and gene sets are under-explored. Here we present pathVar, a new method that provides functional interpretation of gene expression variability changes at the level of pathways and gene sets. pathVar is based on a multinomial exact test, or an asymptotic Chi-squared test as a more computationally-efficient alternative. The method can be used for gene expression studies from any technology platform in all biological settings either with a single phenotypic group, or two-group comparisons. To demonstrate its utility, we applied the method to a diverse set of diseases, species and samples. Results from pathVar are benchmarked against analyses based on average expression via GSEA, and demonstrate that analyses using both statistics are useful for understanding transcriptional regulation.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2585/', ['Bioinformatics', 'Cell Biology', 'Statistics'], [u'Department of Systems and Computational Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine', u"Department of Biomedical and Health Informatics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia", u'Pediatrics, University of Pennsylvania', u'Department of Food Science and Technology, University of California, Davis', u'Department of Anatomy and Neuroscience, University of Melbourne', u'Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Albert Einstein College of Medicine']]
