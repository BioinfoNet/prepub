[u'10 simple rules for developing the best experimental design in biology', ['Angela Joseph'], u'2016-09-18', u'These 10 simple rules were designed to help researchers develop an effective experimental design in ecology that will help yield meaningful results. These rules were based off of four articles which presented distinctive views on the expectations of experimental design along with common mistakes which are often overseen. These rules will act as a guide for researchers to determine whether or not different factors were considered in the construction of their experimental design. It will also help editors and readers deduce whether the experimental design used in an experiment was well designed or not and how it could be improved.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2456/', ['Animal Behavior', 'Biodiversity', 'Ecology', 'Ecosystem Science', 'Environmental Sciences'], [u'Department of Biology, York University']]
