[u'Developmental toxicity from exposure to various forms of mercury compounds in medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) embryos', ['Wu Dong', 'Jie Liu', 'Lixin Wei', 'Yang Jingfeng', 'Melissa Chernick', 'David E. Hinton'], u'2016-08-01', u'This study examined developmental toxicity of different mercury compounds, including some used in traditional medicines. Medaka (Oryzias latipes) embryos were exposed to 0.001-10 \u03bcM concentrations of MeHg, HgCl2, \u03b1-HgS (Zhu Sha), and \u03b2-HgS (Zuotai) from stage 10 (6-7 hpf) to 10 days post fertilization (dpf). Of the forms of mercury in this study, the organic form (MeHg) proved the most toxic followed by inorganic mercury (HgCl2), both producing embryo developmental toxicity. Altered phenotypes included pericardial edema with elongated or tube heart, reduction of eye pigmentation, and failure of swim bladder inflation. Both \u03b1-HgS and \u03b2-HgS were less toxic than MeHg and HgCl2. Total RNA was extracted from survivors 3 days after exposure to MeHg (0.1 \u03bcM), HgCl2 (1 \u03bcM), \u03b1-HgS (10 \u03bcM), or \u03b2-HgS (10 \u03bcM) to examine toxicity-related gene expression. MeHg and HgCl2 markedly induced metallothionein (MT) and heme oxygenase-1 (Ho-1), while \u03b1-HgS and \u03b2-HgS failed to induce either gene. Chemical forms of mercury compounds proved to be a major determinant in their developmental toxicity.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2329/', ['Aquaculture, Fisheries and Fish Science', 'Developmental Biology', 'Toxicology', 'Pharmacology', 'Public Health'], [u'School of Animal Science and Technology; Inner Mongolia Provincial Key Laboratory for Toxicants and Animal Disease, Inner Mongolia Agricultural University', u'Nicholas School of the Environment, Duke University', u'Zunyi Medical College, Department of Pharmacology', u'Department of Tibetan Medicine, Northwest Institute of Plateau Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences', u'School of Animal Science and Technology; Inner Mongolia Provincial Key Laboratory for Toxicants and Animal Disease, Inner Mongolia University for Nationalities, Inner Mongolia Provincial Key Laboratory for Toxicants and Animal Disease, Inner Mongolia University for Nationalities']]
[u'Promotion of surface energy closure by monitoring tree biomass heat storage', ['Minghan Yu', 'Guodong Ding', 'Guanglei Gao', 'Yuanyuan Zhao', 'Ke Sai', 'Xu Li', 'Yue Wang', 'Yundong Liu'], u'2016-08-01', u'Biomass heat storage is important for promoting energy closure in forest ecosystems; however, this issue is often ignored in surface energy budgets. To determine an accurate approach to calculate biomass heat storage, we monitored the stem temperature of Pinus sylvestris in different heights, depths and orientations. At the same time, air sensible and latent heat storage and soil heat storage are also monitored together with biomass heat storage to study the heat storage share in surface energy budgets. The results showed that (1) temperature in different heights, depths and orientations in stem showed obviously differences dynamics, and time lags are existed between different measuring points inside stem. (2) Tree biomass heat flux varied around 12 W m\u22122. Soil heat flux and air heat storage were around 20 W m\u22122 and 8 W m\u22122 separately, but out of phase with biomass heat flux. (3) Total heat storage in soil, biomass, and air was 60 W m \u22122 , accounting for ~10% of net radiation, which is a significant proportion of the total energy flux. This study will help improve biomass heat storage models and contribute to fundamental knowledge regarding energy balance closure in forest ecosystems.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2328/', ['Ecology', 'Ecosystem Science'], [u'Yanchi Research Station, School of Soil and Water Conservation, Beijing Forestry University (\u5317\u4eac\u6797\u4e1a\u5927\u5b66)', u'Key Laboratory of State Forestry Administration on Soil and Water Conservation, Beijing Forestry University (\u5317\u4eac\u6797\u4e1a\u5927\u5b66)', u'Engineering Research Center of Forestry Ecological Engineering, Ministry of Education, Beijing Forestry University (\u5317\u4eac\u6797\u4e1a\u5927\u5b66)']]
[u'A new specimen-dependent method of estimating felid body mass', ['Shaheer Sherani'], u'2016-08-01', u'Background. The estimation of body mass of long extinct species of the family Felidae has been a focus of paleontology. However, most utilized methods impose expected proportions on the fossil specimens being estimated, resulting in a high chance of underestimation or overestimation. This study proposes a new method of estimating felid body mass by accounting for osteological proportionality differences between the extinct taxa being estimated and the living species being used as comparisons.\nMethod. Using a manipulation of the cube law, 36 equations were formulated that estimate body mass based on certain humeral and femoral dimensions. The formulated equations were used to examine whether the mass of living comparison species, namely the tiger (Panthera tigris), the lion (Panthera leo), and the jaguar (Panthera onca), depends equally on a select set of long bone dimensions. The body mass of five extinct felids, namely Panthera atrox, Panthera spelaea, Panthera tigris soloensis, Smilodon populator, and Smilodon fatalis, was also estimated.\nResults. Living comparisons species were found to somewhat incorrectly estimate other living comparison species. All five extinct taxa were found to weigh well over 300 kg, with the largest of the species weighing nearly 500 kg.\nDiscussion. The inability of one living comparison species to predict the mass of another with strong accuracy suggests that bone dimensions do not solely influence body mass. Discrepancies between the masses of Smilodon populator and Smilodon fatalis were likely the product of the difference in available niches in late Pleistocene North and South America. The masses of Panthera spelaea and Panthera atrox indicate a discrepancy in sociality between the two closely related species. Lastly, the extreme body mass of Panthera tigris soloensis points to great plasticity within the tiger lineage in terms of size, indicating that such variations among tiger populations may not warrant subspeciation.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2327/', ['Paleontology', 'Zoology'], [u'Department of Biology, George Mason University']]
[u'Ten simple rules for Lightning and PechaKucha presentations.', ['Christopher J Lortie'], u'2016-08-01', u'An interesting opportunity has emerged that bridges the gap between lengthy, detailed presentations of scientific findings and \u2018sound bites\u2019 appropriate for media reporting \u2013 very short presentations often presented in sets. Lightning or Ignite (20 slides @15 seconds each) and PechaKucha (20 slides @20 seconds each) presentations are common formats for short, rapid communications at scientific conferences and public events. The simple rules for making good presentations also apply, but these presentation formats provide both unique communication opportunities and novel challenges.
