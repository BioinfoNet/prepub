[u'Predicting enhancers using a small subset of high confidence examples and co-training', ['Matthew R Huska', 'Anna Ramisch', 'Martin Vingron', 'Annalisa Marsico'], u'2016-09-01', u'Enhancers are important regulatory regions located throughout the genome, primarily in non-coding regions. Several experimental methods have been developed over the last several years to identify their location, but the search space is large and the overlap between the putative enhancer identified using these methods tends to be very small. Computational methods for enhancer prediction often use one large set of experimentally identified enhancer regions as input, and therefore rely critically on their correctness. We chose to take a different approach, and start with a high confidence set of 21 enhancer that are in the intersection of enhancers identified using three completely unrelated experimental approaches: deepCAGE, HiCap and classical enhancer reporter assays. Because this starting set is so small, we use a semi-supervised approach called co-training rather than a fully supervised approach to progressively predict enhancers from unlabeled regions. Using this approach we are able to outperform supervised learning as well as simpler semi-supervised learning methods and achieve an average area under the ROC curve of 0.84.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2407/', ['Computational Biology', 'Genomics'], [u'Computational Molecular Biology, Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics', u'RNA Bioinformatics, Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics']]

Peres', 'Eric Lam', 'Joni E Lima', 'Antonio V. O. Figueira', 'Henrique Marques-Souza'], u'2016-09-01', u'RNA interference (RNAi), a gene-silencing mechanism that involves providing double-stranded RNA molecules that match a specific target gene sequence, is now widely used in functional genetic studies. The potential application of RNAi-mediated control of agricultural insect pests has rapidly become evident. The production of transgenic plants expressing dsRNA molecules that target essential insect genes could provide a means of specific gene silencing in larvae that feed on these plants, resulting in larval phenotypes that range from loss of appetite to death. In this report, we show that the tomato leafminer (Tuta absoluta), a major threat to commercial tomato production, can be targeted by RNAi. We selected two target genes [Vacuolar ATPase-A and Arginine kinase] based on the RNAi response reported for these genes in other pest species. In view of the lack of an artificial diet for T. absoluta, we used two approaches to deliver dsRNA into tomato leaflets. The first approach was based on the uptake of dsRNA by leaflets and the second was based on \u201cin planta-induced transient gene silencing\u201d (PITGS), a well-established method for silencing plant genes, used here for the first time to deliver in planta-transcribed dsRNA to target insect genes. Tuta absoluta larvae that fed on leaves containing dsRNA of the target genes showed an ~60% reduction in target gene transcript accumulation, an increase in larval mortality and less leaf damage. We then generated transgenic \u2018Micro-Tom\u2019 tomato plants that expressed hairpin sequences for both genes and observed a reduction in foliar damage by T. absoluta in these plants. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of RNAi as an alternative method for controlling this critical tomato pest.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2406/', ['Agricultural Science', 'Molecular Biology', 'Plant Science'], [u'Centro de Energia Nuclear na Agricultura, Universidade de S\xe3o Paulo', u'Departamento de Bioqu\xedmica e Biologia Tecidual, Universidade Estadual de Campinas', u'Escola Superior de Agricultura \u201cLuiz de Queiroz\u201d (ESALQ), Universidade de S\xe3o Paulo', u'Department of Plant Biology & Pathology, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey', u'Departamento de Bot\xe2nica, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais']]

We used mitochondrial and nuclear sequence data to analyse phylogeographic patterns in a group of endemic land snails of the genus Candidula from a valley of central Portugal (Vale da Couda) showing an exceptionally narrow distributional range. Phylogenetic analyses recovered Vale da Couda specimens in two main clades that do not share a common ancestry. Considering the restricted geographic distribution, an unusual high number of haplotypes was found. These haplotypes were unevenly distributed among the sampling sites. Our results show a departure from the expectation that species with restricted distributions have low genetic variability. The putative past and contemporary models of geographic distribution of Vale da Couda lineages are compatible with a scenario of species co-existence in more southern locations during the last glacial maximum (LGM) followed by a post-LGM northern dispersal tracking the species optimal thermal, humidity and soil physical conditions. Mismatch analysis indicated a population expansion during the LGM, which corroborates our biogeographic scenario.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2405/', ['Conservation Biology', 'Evolutionary Studies'], [u'CCMAR-CIMAR Laborat\xf3rio Associado, Centre for Marine Sciences', u'Departamento de Ci\xeancias da Vida, Escola de Psicologia e Ci\xeancias da Vida, Universidade Lus\xf3fona', u'REN Biodiversity Chair, CIBIO/InBIO Associate Laboratory, Universidade do Porto', u'Centro de Ecologia Aplicada Prof. Baeta Neves/InBIO Associate Laboratory, Instituto Superior de Agronomia, Universidade de Lisboa']]
[u'Nonlinear temperature effects on multifractal complexity of metabolic rate of mice', ['Fabio A Labra', 'Jose M Bogdanovich', 'Francisco Bozinovic'], u'2016-09-01', u'Complex physiological dynamics have been argued to be a signature of healthy physiological function. Here we test whether the complexity of metabolic rate fluctuations in small endotherms decreases with lower environmental temperatures. To do so we examine the multifractal temporal scaling properties of the rate of change in oxygen consumption r(VO2), in the laboratory mouse Mus musculus, assessing their long range correlation properties across 7 different environmental temperatures, ranging from 0\xb0C to 30\xb0C. To do so, we applied multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA), finding that r(VO2) fluctuations show two scaling regimes. For small time scales below the crossover time (approximately 102 seconds), either monofractal or weak multifractal dynamics are observed depending on whether Ta<15\xb0C or Ta > 15\xb0C respectively. For larger time scales, r(VO2) fluctuations are characterized by an asymptotic scaling exponent that indicates multifractal anti-persistent or uncorrelated dynamics. For both scaling regimes, a generalization of the multiplicative cascade model provides very good fits for the Renyi exponents \u03c4(q), showing that the infinite number of exponents h(q) can be described by only two independent parameters, a and b. We also show that the long-range correlation structure of r(VO2) time series differs from randomly shuffled series, and may not be explained as an artifact of stochastic sampling of a linear frequency spectrum. These results show that metabolic rate dynamics in a well studied micro-endotherm are consistent with a highly non-linear feedback control system.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2404/', ['Computational Biology', 'Ecology', 'Mathematical Biology', 'Statistics'], [u'Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad Santo Tom\xe1s', u'Centro de Investigaci\xf3n e Innovaci\xf3n para el Cambio Clim\xe1tico, Universidad Santo Tom\xe1s', u'Departamento de Ecolog\xeda, Center of Applied Ecology & Sustainability (CAPES) and LINC-Global, Facultad de Ciencias Biol\xf3gicas, Pontificia Universidad Cat\xf3lica de Chile']]

This has been greatly aided by the development of the molecular clock, which enables evolutionary timescales to be estimated from genetic data. In recent years, high-throughput sequencing technology has led to an increase in the feasibility and availability of genome-scale data sets. These represent a rich source of biological information, but they also bring a set of analytical challenges. In this review, we provide an overview of phylogenomic dating and describe the challenges associated with analysing genome-scale data.
