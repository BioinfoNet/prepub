[u'A benchmark for evaluation of phylogeny reconstruction programs', ['Sergei Spirin'], u'2016-12-08', u'There are a lot of algorithms and programs for reconstruction of phylogeny of a set of proteins basing on multiple sequence alignment. Many programs allow users to choose a number of parameters, for example, a model for maximum likelihood programs. Different programs and different parameters often produce different results. However at the moment all published benchmarks for evaluation of relative accuracy of programs or different choices of parameters are based on simulated sequences. The aim of the present work is to create a benchmark that allows a comparison of phylogenetic programs on large sets of alignments of natural protein sequences.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2628/', ['Bioinformatics', 'Computational Biology', 'Evolutionary Studies'], [u'Belozersky Institute of Physico-Chemical Biology, Lomonosov Moscow State University']]
[u'Microbiome of the sexual scent organ of Leptonycteris yerbabuenae', ['Osiris Gaona', 'Daniel Cerqueda-Garcia', 'Daniel Martinez-Martinez', 'Andres Moya', 'Luisa I. Falcon'], u'2016-12-08', u'Microorganisms are tightly bounded to the animals on Earth. Bacteria, among other types of microbes, interact with their hosts in several ways regarding metabolic pathways, development, complex behavioral processes such as mate recognition, among others. The adult males of Leptonycteris yerbabuenae, a nectarivorous bat, develop an interscapular odoriferous patch during the mating season. Here we present a description of the microbiota associated to this sebaceous patch 11 adult males, and studied it in terms of their taxonomical information. The variability between samples was not relevant to this study, and the most abundant phyla were Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, with dominanting classes including Gammaproteobacteria, Clostridia and Bacilli. The two most abundant species were Aggregatibacter pneumotropica and Actinomyces europaeus and other Streptococcus minor, Pseudomonas stutzeri, P. viridiflava and Staphylococcus epidermis, which are relevant in both normal and wounded human skin. Furthermore, the species present in this mating organ are involved in metabolic pathways related to fatty acid transformation to volatile molecules, which could be playing a key role in mate recognition.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2627/', ['Animal Behavior', 'Biodiversity', 'Conservation Biology', 'Molecular Biology', 'Zoology'], [u'Ecolog\xeda Bacteriana, Instituto de Ecolog\xeda, Universidad Nacional Aut\xf3noma de M\xe9xico', u'Ecolog\xeda Bacteriana, Instituto de Ecolog\xeda., Universidad Nacional Aut\xf3noma de M\xe9xico', u'Biodiversitat i Biologia Evolutiva, Institut Cavanilles, Universitat de Val\xe8ncia']]
