In this study we describe the complete mitochondrial genome of the peregrine earthworm Pontoscolex corethrurus. This is the first record of a mitochondrial genome within the Rhinodrilidae family. Its mitochondrial genome is 14 835 bp in length containing 37 genes (13 protein-coding genes (PCG), 2 rRNA genes and 22 tRNA genes). It has the same gene content and structure as in other sequenced earthworms, but unusual among invertebrates it has several overlapping open reading frames. All genes are encoded on the same strand, most of the PCGs use ATG as the start codon except for NAD3, which uses GTG as the start codon. The T+A content of the mitochondrial genome is 59.9% (31.9% A, 27.9% T, 14.9% G, and 25.3% for C). The annotated genome sequence has been deposited in GenBank under the accession number KT988053.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2847/', ['Environmental Sciences', 'Genetics', 'Molecular Biology', 'Soil Science'], [u'Departamento de Ci\xeancias do Solo, Universidade Federal do Paran\xe1', u'CIRN/Biologia, Universidade dos Acores', u'Biological Sciences, Cardiff University', u'Sustainable Living Dept., Maharishi University of Management', u'Biological Sciences, Cardiff University', u'Florestas, EMBRAPA', u'Institut d\u2019\xe9cologie et des sciences de l\u2019environnement de Paris, Universit\xe9 Paris Est Cr\xe9teil', u'Centro de Vulcanologia e Avalia\xe7\xe3o de Riscos Geol\xf3gicos, Universidade dos Acores', u'Laboratorio Nacional de Gen\xf3mica para la Biodiversidad, Unidad de Gen\xf3mica Avanzada, Centro de Investigaci\xf3n y de Estudios Avanzados del Instituto Polit\xe9cnico Nacional']]
[u'Normalization of metatranscriptomic and metaproteomic data for differential gene expression analyses: The importance of accounting for organism abundance', ['Manuel Kleiner'], u'2017-03-02', u'Metatranscriptomics and metaproteomics make it possible to measure gene expression in microbial communities. So far these approaches were mostly used to get a general overview of the dominant metabolism and physiologies of community members. Recently, environmental microbiologists have started using metatranscriptomics and metaproteomics to look at gene expression differences between different environments or conditions. This has been mostly done by using makeshift adaptations of pure culture focused differential transcriptomics and proteomics approaches. However, since meta-omics data has many more variables attached to it as compared to pure culture derived data, such makeshift adaptations are problematic at best. One particular challenge is posed by the data normalization strategies used to account for technical and biological variables in meta-omic data. Here I discuss the most common normalization strategy for transcriptomic and proteomic data and why it is not valid by itself for meta-omic data. I provide logical proof that variation in species abundances between samples is an additional variable that must be accounted for during normalization of meta-omic data. Finally, I show how the existing normalization methods for transcriptomic and proteomic data can be augmented to be applicable to meta-omic data.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2846/', ['Bioinformatics', 'Ecology', 'Environmental Sciences', 'Genomics', 'Microbiology'], [u'Department of Geoscience, University of Calgary', u'Department of Plant and Microbial Biology, North Carolina State University']]
[u'Towards a dashboard environment for repeating and reusing research', ['Ian Taylor', 'Jarek Nabrzyski'], u'2017-03-02', u'Over the past 18 months, we have been working on a dashboard concept that enables researchers a means of interacting with existing research. This work was motivated by the National Data Service (NDS), which is an emerging vision of how scientists and researchers across all disciplines can find, reuse, and publish data. NDS intends to provide an international federation of data providers, data aggregators, community-specific federations, publishers, and cyberinfrastructure providers by linking data archiving and sharing efforts together with a common set of tools. This abstract provides a status of the two existing proof-of-concept pilot dashboard implementations and how we plan to evolve this work. At a high level, the researcher dashboard aims to provide an intuitive Web-based interface to expose fully interactive research containers that support the lifecycle of scholarly communication. Research containers enable executable and repeatable research by supporting methods, source code, and data within dynamically created Docker containers.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2845/', ['Human-Computer Interaction', 'Computer Architecture', 'Data Science', 'World Wide Web and Web Science', 'Software Engineering'], [u'Computer Science And Informatics, Cardiff University', u'Computer Science and Engineering, University of Notre Dame', u'Computer Research Center and Computer Science and Engineering, University of Notre Dame']]
[u'Visualising higher-dimensional space-time and space-scale objects as projections to \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\)', ['Ken Arroyo Ohori', 'Hugo Ledoux', 'Jantien Stoter'], u'2017-03-02', u"Objects of more than three dimensions can be used to model geographic phenomena that occur in space, time and scale. For instance, a single 4D object can be used to represent the changes in a 3D object's shape across time or all its optimal representations at various levels of detail. In this paper, we look at how such higher-dimensional space-time and space-scale objects can be visualised as projections from \\(\\mathbb{R}^4\\) to \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\). We present three projections that we believe are particularly intuitive for this purpose: (i) a simple `long axis' projection that puts 3D objects side by side; (ii) the well-known orthographic and perspective projections; and (iii) a projection to a 3-sphere (\\(S^3\\)) followed by a stereographic projection to \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\), which results in an inwards-outwards fourth axis. Our focus is in using these projections from \\(\\mathbb{R}^4\\) to \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\), but they are formulated from \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) to \\(\\mathbb{R}^{n-1}\\) so as to be easily extensible and to incorporate other non-spatial characteristics. We present a prototype interactive visualiser that applies these projections from 4D to 3D in real-time using the programmable pipeline and compute shaders of the Metal graphics API.", u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2844/', ['Graphics', 'Spatial and Geographic Information Systems'], [u'3D Geoinformation, Delft University of Technology']]

ATLAS transforms raw sequence data into functional and taxonomic data at the microbial population level and provides genome-centric resolution through genome binning. ATLAS provides robust taxonomy based on majority voting of protein-coding open reading frames (ORFs) rolled-up at the contig level using modified lowest common ancestor (LCA) analysis.
