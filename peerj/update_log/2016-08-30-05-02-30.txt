[u'EasyMirror and EasyImport: Simplifying the setup of a custom Ensembl database and webserver for any species', ['Richard J Challis', 'Sujai Kumar', 'Lewis Lewis Stevens', 'Mark Blaxter'], u'2016-08-29', u'As the generation and use of genomic datasets is becoming increasingly common in all areas of biology, the need for resources to collate, analyse and present data from one or more genome projects is becoming more pressing. The Ensembl platform is a powerful tool to make genome data and cross-species analyses easily accessible through a web interface and a comprehensive API. Here we introduce the EasyMirror and EasyImport pipelines to facilitate the setup and hosting of custom Ensembl genome browsers.\nEasyMirror (https://github.com/lepbase/easy-mirror) makes it possible to set up a mirror of any Ensembl or Ensembl Genomes (including Bacteria, Metazoa, Fungi, Plants and Protists) species in four simple steps that can be run in less than an hour on a fresh Ubuntu installation. This tool exploits the modular nature of the Ensembl codebase to allow a site to be set up with none, some or all of the data hosted locally.\nEasyImport (https://github.com/lepbase/easy-mirror) extends this approach to simplify the import of genomic data for any species from standard flat files into the Ensembl database schema, ready to be deployed using EasyMirror. All that is needed to get started is a genome fasta file and the gene models in GFF format.\nDocumentation for both pipelines is available at http://easy-import.readme.io', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2401/', ['Bioinformatics', 'Genomics'], [u'Institute of Evolutionary Biology, University of Edinburgh']]
[u'The GRIMMER test: A method for testing the validity of reported measures of variability', ['Jordan Anaya'], u'2016-08-29', u'GRIMMER (Granularity-Related Inconsistency of Means Mapped to Error Repeats) builds upon the GRIM test and allows for testing whether reported measures of variability are mathematically possible. GRIMMER relies upon the statistical phenomenon that variances display a simple repetitive pattern when the data is discrete, i.e. granular. This observation allows for the generation of an algorithm that can quickly identify whether a reported statistic of any size or precision is consistent with the stated sample size and granularity. My implementation of the test is available at PrePubMed (http://www.prepubmed.org/grimmer) and currently allows for testing variances, standard deviations, and standard errors for integer data. It is possible to extend the test to other measures of variability such as deviation from the mean, or apply the test to non-integer data such as data reported to halves or tenths. The ability of the test to identify inconsistent statistics relies upon four factors: (1) the sample size; (2) the granularity of the data; (3) the precision (number of decimals) of the reported statistic; and (4) the size of the standard deviation or standard error (but not the variance). The test is most powerful when the sample size is small, the granularity is large, the statistic is reported to a large number of decimal places, and the standard deviation or standard error is small (variance is immune to size considerations). This test has important implications for any field that routinely reports statistics for granular data to at least two decimal places because it can help identify errors in publications, and should be used by journals during their initial screen of new submissions. The errors detected can be the result of anything from something as innocent as a typo or rounding error to large statistical mistakes or unfortunately even fraud. In this report I describe the mathematical foundations of the GRIMMER test and the algorithm I use to implement it.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2400/', ['Science Policy', 'Statistics'], [u'omnesres.com']]
