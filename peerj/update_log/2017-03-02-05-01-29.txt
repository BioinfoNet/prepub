[u'Why do jellyfish bloom in Norwegian waters and what can be done to recover the ecosystems in the North Sea and on the Norwegian coast?', ['Johannes Hamre'], u'2017-03-02', u'The ecosystems with their relationships between fish species and stocks, have been established by evolution for millions of years, but during the last 50 years, the ecosystems in the North Sea and along the Norwegian coast have been changed fundamentally by fisheries. The North Sea mackerel stock has been depleted and its feeding grounds have been invaded by the Western mackerel which spawns west of Ireland. This stock is now very rich in numbers and occupies the North Sea, the Norwegian Sea and the western Barents Sea. If the trend continues, mackerel may outcompete many of the other fish stocks in the area. Traditionally and until the beginning of the 1970s, there was a large stock of sandeel spawning in the North Sea and on the Norwegian coast. Sandeel juveniles was an important food source for a wide range of species, including sea mammals and birds. The fact that this stock has also been overfished, may explain many changes observed in the ecosystem on the west coast of Norway, for example a large reduction in the populations of sea birds. There are several instances where ecosystems shift to sustain jellyfish blooms in response to depletion of forage fish stocks. This was registered in Namibia in the 1990\u2019s, where the pilchard stock was decimated and the biomass of jellyfish soon became overwhelming. On the west-coast of Norway, there are now frequent blooms of jellyfish, yet another indication that a controlling factor is missing in the system, in this case sandeel, which is a key species in the transfer of nutrients from zooplankton to higher trophic levels in the area. In this paper, I give a description of the situation and some suggested measures that should be taken in fisheries management.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2842/', ['Aquaculture, Fisheries and Fish Science', 'Ecosystem Science'], [u'Institute of Marine Research']]
[u'The influence of soil microbial community structure on carbon and nitrogen partitioning in plant/soil ecosystems', ['David C. Johnson'], u'2017-03-02', u'A greenhouse study was conducted to evaluate the influence of increasing soil fungal-to-bacterial ratios (F:B) on the allocation of plant-photosynthate carbon into the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) partitions (g) of plant components (root, shoot and fruit), New-Soil C and N, and Soil-Respiration C (CO2). Six (6) experimental treatment soils were formulated to provide linearly increasing: initial-soil C% (0.14% \u2013 5.3%); initial-soil N% (0.01% - 0.40%); and soil microbial community (SMC) populations progressing from bacterial dominant (F:B=0.04) to fungal dominant (F:B=3.68) while still maintaining significant SMC population homogeneity. In an 86-day greenhouse experiment, growing chile plants (Capsicum annuum) in treatment soils with increasing F:B (0.4-3.68), the following was observed: a) a continuous linear increase (3% up to 56%) in the partitioning of total plant-photosynthate C into plant biomass (root, shoot and fruit) when regressed to initial F:B (m=0.13; r2=0.96); b) approximately 93% of the flow of plant-photosynthate C was partitioned into New-Soil C in Treatment 0 (F:B = 0.04), to a minimum of 47% in Treatment 5 (F:B = 3.68) demonstrating a negative linear correlation to treatment Initial-Soil C mass (m= -0.12; r2 = 0.97); c) conditional and coordinated flow of system C resources into nitrogen (N) fixation (est. C cost for N fixation at 6:1), with 1.21 g C partitioned to N fixation in Treatment 0 (F:B=0.04), peaking at 6.92 g C in Treatment 2 (F:B=1.6), and final C partitioning to N fixation of 2.91 g C in Treatment 5 (F:B=3.68), following a 3rd order polynomial trendline (r2=0.99) when correlated with initial treatment soil C mass; d)  decreases in soil respiration, from 44% of Initial-Soil C substrate respired in bacterial-dominant low-C (0.14%) soils (F:B = 0.04) to 11% in fungal dominant (F:B = 3.68), high-C percent (5.30% C) soils (y = -0.108ln(x)+ 0.4987; r2= 0.95). Increasing the F:B in the soils of agroecosystems may provide more efficient accumulation and partitioning of photosynthate C into plant and soil biomass, improved N fixation and beneficial increases in total carbon use efficiencies. Collectively, these benefits could provide a practical and cost-effective path towards: improving crop production, reducing N-fertilizer inputs, promoting a more sustainable agricultural system, while providing a cost-effective approach for capturing and storing atmospheric carbon (CO2) in soils of agroecosystems.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2841/', ['Agricultural Science', 'Soil Science'], [u'Institute for Sustainable Agricultural Research, WERC, College of Engineering, New Mexico State University']]
[u'Landscapes of fear: from trophic cascades to applied management and population ecology', ['Sonny S Bleicher'], u'2017-03-02', u'Predator-Prey dynamics, and their trophic impacts, have functioned as a focal point in both community and population biology for five decades. The work-group focusing on these dynamics has however largely changed the focus of their work from trophic effects to the study of non-consumptive effects of predation-- the \u201cecology of fear\u201d. An increasing number of studies chose to spatially chart wildlife populations\u2019 risk assessment and of those the majority use optimal patch-use (giving-up densities) as a continuous measure of fear. These charts, \u201clandscapes-of-fear\u201d (LOFs) originated in conservation literature and the reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone. Today, they are used to study population habitat selection and venture into the evolutionary context with studies examining the mechanisms by which species coexist in the same physical space. This review predicts increase in, and encourages the use of, LOFs: as a conservation tool to assess species land-use; as a bridge between ecology and neurology with stress hormones as indicators fear; and as a tool to compare species\u2019 evolutionary dynamics within a community context.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2840/', ['Animal Behavior', 'Conservation Biology', 'Ecology'], [u'Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Arizona']]
