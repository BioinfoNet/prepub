[u'Dynamics of resource allocation in biological systems', ['Imadol V Jeff-Eke'], u'2016-10-06', u'Here we present a single working model that attempts at reconciliation of biological systems. To do this we recognize and emphasize a universal theme of all biological systems: a need for resources. That is, we consider the dynamics of resource allocation as a requirement for actuation of responses to stimuli. In addition, all contemplations are founded on four postulates that are motivated by the homeostatic principle as conceived of by Claude Bernard and Walter Cannon: biological systems exhaust attempts to prevent from reaching the absolute maximum failure potential; biological systems tend in the direction toward the absolute minimum failure potential; biological systems attempt to assume the failure potential of an ideal regulator system; and all biological systems attempt to be in agreement with all four postulates. Finally, we attempt to determine biological manifestations of the stated model.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2503/', ['Biochemistry', 'Cell Biology', 'Mathematical Biology', 'Anatomy and Physiology', 'Metabolic Sciences'], [u'Morehouse School of Medicine']]
