[u'Condition dependence in animal colouration: tools for a comparative approach', ['Jessica Ethier', 'Emma Despland'], u'2016-10-25', u'The study of condition dependence in animal colour has undergone important changes in recent years. In particular, the focus on carotenoid-based colour traits is a thing of the past and a broader, comparative approach is becoming more common. Here, we refine a previously developed theoretical model describing pigment expression as a saturating function of resource intake and demonstrate its use as a tool to compare patterns of resource assimilation, resource allocation, and condition dependence between groups of organisms. Using a simple equation and non-linear regression analyses, we apply this saturating model to melanin-based colouration in a model insect species. We find that patterns of condition dependence differ between sexes, phenotypes, and populations, suggesting underlying differences in resource allocation priorities. Our results highlight both the usefulness of this method and the value of a comparative approach in identifying proximate mechanisms of condition dependence.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2556/', ['Ecology', 'Entomology', 'Evolutionary Studies'], [u'Biology Department, Concordia University']]
[u'Testing the habituation assumption underlying models of parasitoid foraging behavior', ['Paul K Abram', 'Antonino Cusumano', 'Katrina Abram', 'Stefano Colazza', 'Ezio Peri'], u'2016-10-25', u'Habituation, a form of non-associative learning, has several well-defined characteristics that apply to a wide range of physiological and behavioral responses in many organisms. In classic patch time allocation models, habituation is considered to be a major mechanistic component of parasitoid behavioral strategies. However, parasitoid behavioral responses to host cues have not previously been tested for the known, specific characteristics of habituation. Here, we tested whether the foraging behavior of the egg parasitoid Trissolcus basalis shows specific characteristics of habituation in response to consecutive encounters with patches of host (Nezara viridula) chemical contact cues (footprints), in particular: (i) a training interval-dependent decline in response intensity, and (ii) a training interval dependent recovery of the response. As would be expected of a habituated response, wasps trained at higher frequencies decreased their behavioral response to host footprints more quickly and to a greater degree than those trained at low frequencies, and subsequently showed a more rapid, although partial, recovery of their behavioral response to host footprints. In contrast to previously studied forms of parasitoid memory (i.e., from associative learning), this putative habituation learning could not be blocked by cold anesthesia, ingestion of an ATPase inhibitor, or ingestion of a protein synthesis inhibitor. Our study provides support for the assumption that diminishing responses of parasitoids to chemical indicators of host presence constitutes habituation as opposed to sensory fatigue, and may indicate that the underlying mechanisms differ from other, better-studied forms of parasitoid learning.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2555/', ['Animal Behavior', 'Ecology', 'Entomology'], [u'Universit\xe9 de Montr\xe9al, Institut de Recherche en Biologie V\xe9g\xe9tale', u'Laboratory of Entomolgy, Wageningen Agricultural University', u'Dipartimento di Scienze Agrarie e Forestali, Universit\xe0 degli Studi di Palermo']]
[u'A new correlation of the Cretaceous formations of the Western Interior of the United States, I: Santonian-Maastrichtian formations and dinosaur biostratigraphy', ['Denver W Fowler'], u'2016-10-25', u'Late Cretaceous deposits of the North American Western Interior represent the best, if not only, opportunity to construct a high-resolution chronostratigraphic framework within which to conduct continental-scale geological and paleontological analyses. This is due to the serendipitous combination of large areas of outcrop, interfingering marine units with biostratigraphically informative fossils, and a consistent scattering of radiometric dates due to synorogenic volcanic activity. Accurate correlation is essential for testing a large number of current geological and paleobiological hypotheses; however, despite the large amount of data available, many published correlations suffer from inaccuracies or are simply based on outdated information.\nHere I present a comprehensive high-resolution stratigraphic chart for terrestrial Late Cretaceous units of North America, combining published chronostratigraphic, lithostratigraphic, and biostratigraphic data. For the first time, nearly two hundred 40Ar / 39Ar radiometric dates are recalibrated to both current standard and decay constant pairings, correcting errors in previous recalibrations. Revisions to the stratigraphic placement of most units are slight, but important changes are made to the proposed correlations of the Aguja and Javelina Formations, Texas, and miscalculations in recently published analyses are corrected which in particular affects the relative age positions of the Belly River Group, Alberta; Judith River Group, Montana, Kaiparowits Formation, Utah, and Fruitland and Kirtland Formations, New Mexico.\nThis work represents the most extensive and accurate interbasinal correlation currently available for the North American Western Interior and should replace all previously published similar works and diagrams.\nThe stratigraphic ranges of selected dinosaur clades are plotted on the chronostratigraphic framework, typically forming stacks of short-duration species which do not overlap stratigraphically with preceding or succeeding forms. This is the expected pattern which is produced by an anagenetic mode of evolution, suggesting that true branching (speciation) events were rare and may have geographic significance. Purported north-south provinciality of dinosaurs is shown to be mostly an artifact of stratigraphic miscorrelation. Rapid stepwise acquisition of display characters in many dinosaur clades, in particular chasmosaurine ceratopsids, suggests that they may represent the highest resolution biostratigraphic markers to be used where radiometric dates are not available.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2554/', ['Evolutionary Studies', 'Paleontology'], [u'Paleontology, Dickinson Museum Center']]
