[u'Empirical assessment of transgene flow from transgenic poplar plantation', ['Jianjun Hu', 'Jin Zhang', 'Xingling Chen', 'Jinhui Lv', 'Huixia Jia', 'Shutang Zhao', 'Mengzhu Lu'], u'2016-08-03', u'To assess the possible impact of transgenic poplar plantations on the ecosystem, we analyzed the frequency and distance of gene flow from a mature male transgenic Populus nigra carried Bacillus thuringiensis toxin gene (Bt-OE poplar) plantation, and the survival of Bt-OE poplar seeds as well. The resultant Bt-OE poplar seeds occurred at a frequency from ~0.15% at 0 m to ~0.02% at 500 m far away from the Bt-OE poplar. The Bt-OE poplar seeds weaken and even lost germinated activation within 3 weeks in the field (from 68% to 0%), compared to the 48% germination rate after 3 weeks in 4\xb0C. The survival rate of seedlings in the field is 0% without any treatments, but increased to 1.7% under four treatments (Clean and trim, watering, weeding, and cover with plastic to keep moisture) together after seeded in the field for eight weeks. Results of this study indicate that gene flow originated from Bt-OE poplar plantation through pollen and seed could happen at a very low rate and in a limited range in natural conditions. This study provide the first-hand field data on the extent of transgene flow in poplar plantations, and offer guidance for risk assessment of transgenic poplar plantations.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2335/', ['Agricultural Science', 'Ecology', 'Environmental Sciences', 'Plant Science'], [u'State Key Laboratory of Tree Genetics and Breeding, Key Laboratory of Tree Breeding and Cultivation of State Forestry Administration, Research Institute of Forestry, Chinese Academy of Forestry', u'Collaborative Innovation Center of Sustainable Forestry in Southern China, Nanjing Forestry University', u'Changchun Academy of Forestry']]
[u'Common metabolic constraints on dive duration in endothermic and ectothermic vertebrates', ['April Hayward', 'Mariela Pajuelo', 'Catherine G. Haase', 'David M. Anderson', 'James F. Gillooly'], u'2016-08-03', u'Dive duration in air-breathing vertebrates is thought to be constrained by the volume of oxygen stored in the body and the rate at which it is consumed (i.e., \u201co xygen store/usage hypothesis\u201d ). The body mass-dependence of dive duration among endothermic vertebrates is largely supportive of this model, but previous analyses of ectothermic vertebrates show no such body mass-dependence. Here we show that dive duration in both endotherms and ectotherms largely support the oxygen store/usage hypothesis after accounting for the well-established effects of temperature on oxygen consumption rates. Analyses of the body mass and temperature dependence of dive duration in 181 species of endothermic vertebrates and 29 species of ectothermic vertebrates show that dive duration increases as a power law with body mass, and decreases exponentially with increasing temperature. Thus, in the case of ectothermic vertebrates, changes in environmental temperature will likely impact the foraging ecology of divers.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2334/', ['Ecology', 'Zoology'], [u'Department of Biology, University of Florida', u'School of Natural Resources and Environment, University of Florida']]
