A remarkable case is dendritic cell-based immunotherapy, where tumor epitopes identified from the patient\u2019s specific mutation profiles are loaded on patient-derived mature dendritic cells to stimulate cytotoxic T cell mediated anticancer immunity. Here we present a personalized computational pipeline for the selection of tumor-specific epitopes based on 1) patient specific haplotype; 2) cancer associated mutations; and 3) expression profiles of mutation carrying genes. We applied our workflow to one melanoma patient. Specifically, we analyzed tumor whole exome sequencing and RNA sequencing data to first detect tumor-specific mutations followed by epitope prediction based on the patient\u2019s HLA haplotype and filtering of epitopes using expression profile and binding affinity. We performed docking studies to predict the best set of epitopes targeting the patient\u2019s alleles. The proposed workflow enables us to find personalized tumor-specific epitopes for stimulating cytotoxic T-cell responses.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2385/', ['Bioinformatics', 'Dermatology', 'Immunology'], [u'Department  of Dermatology, Universit\xe4tsklinikum Erlangen and Friedrich-Alexander Universit\xe4t Erlangen-N\xfcrnberg', u'Department of Systems Biology and Bioinformatics, Universit\xe4t Rostock', u'Department of Biology, Friedrich-Alexander Universit\xe4t Erlangen-N\xfcrnberg']]
[u'Multitask regression for condition-specific prioritization of miRNA targets in transcripts', ['Azim Dehghani Amirabad', 'Marcel H Schulz'], u'2016-08-22', u'Deregulation of miRNAs is implicated in many diseases in particular cancer, where miRNAs can act as tumour suppressors or oncogenes. As sequence-based miRNA target predictions do not provide condition-specific information, many algorithms combine expression data for miRNAs and genes for prioritization of miRNA targets. However, common strategies prioritize miRNA-gene associations, although a miRNA may only target a subset of the alternative transcripts produced by a gene. Thus, current approaches are suboptimal. Here we address the problem of transcript and not gene based miRNA target prioritization. We show how to leverage methods that were developed for gene expression based miRNA-target prioritization for transcripts. In addition, we introduce a new multitasking based learning (MTL) method that uses structured-sparsity inducing regularization to improve accuracy of the learning. The new MTL approach performs especially favorable in small sample size settings, for genes with many transcripts and with noisy transcript expression level estimates as shown with simulated data. In an analysis of real liver cancer RNA-seq data we show that the MTL approach better predicts transcript expression and outperforms simpler approaches for miRNA-target prediction.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2384/', ['Bioinformatics', 'Computational Biology', 'Data Mining and Machine Learning'], [u'Cluster of Excellence for Multimodal Computing and Interaction, Saarland University', u'Computational Biology and Applied Algorithms, Max Planck Institute for Informatics', u'International Max Planck Research School for Computer Science']]
[u'Improving ancient DNA genome assembly', ['Alexander Seitz', 'Kay Nieselt'], u'2016-08-22', u'Most reconstruction methods for genomes of ancient origin that are used today require a closely related reference. In order to identify genomic rearrangements or the deletion of whole genes, de novo assembly has to be used. However, because of inherent problems with ancient DNA, its de novo assembly is highly complicated. In order to tackle the diversity in the length of the input reads, we propose a two-layer approach, where multiple assemblies are generated in the first layer, which are then combined in the second layer. We used this two-layer assembly to generate assemblies for an ancient sample and compared the results to current de novo assembly approaches. We are able to improve the assembly with respect to the length of the contigs and can resolve more repetitive regions.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2383/', ['Bioinformatics', 'Paleontology', 'Computational Science'], [u'Center for Bioinformatics (ZBIT), Integrative Transcriptomics, Eberhard-Karls-Universit\xe4t T\xfcbingen']]
[u'RGFA: powerful and convenient handling of assembly graphs', ['Giorgio Gonnella', 'Stefan Kurtz'], u'2016-08-22', u'The \u201cGraphical Fragment Assembly\u201d (GFA) is an emerging format for the representation of sequence assembly graphs, which can be adopted by both de Bruijn graph- and string graph-based assemblers. Here we present RGFA, an implementation of the proposed GFA specification in Ruby. It allows to conveniently parse, edit and write GFA files. Complex operations such as the separation of the implicit instances of repeats and the merging of linear paths can be performed. A typical application of RGFA is the editing of a graph, to finish the assembly of a sequence, using information not available to the assembler. We illustrate a use case, in which the assembly of a repetitive metagenomic fosmid insert was completed using a script based on RGFA. Furthermore, we show how the API provided by RGFA allows to design complex graph editing algorithms. As an example, we developed a detection algorithm for CRISPRs in a de Bruijn graph. Finally, RGFA can be used for comparing assembly graphs, e.g. to document the changes in a graph after applying a GUI editor. A program, GFAdiff is provided, which compares the information in two graphs, and generate a report or a Ruby script documenting the transformation steps between the graphs.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2381/', ['Bioinformatics', 'Genomics'], [u'Zentrum f\xfcr Bioinformatik, Universit\xe4t Hamburg']]

The project has four technical components: sequencing, sequence analysis, data storage and visualisation.\nThe project website http://www.tuebiom.de allows interested people to learn about the project, order a sampling kit and fill-in the metadata questionnaire. Once a sample as been submitted and processed, a participant can explore the taxonomic profile of their gut microbiome and compare it to the typical profile of different comparison groups.This community-based project also hopes to engage participants in science-propagation, spread knowledge about the gut microbiome and the importance of this area of research.\nHere we provide a brief introduction to the T\xfcbiom project and describe the bioinformatics framework that we have developed for it.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2382/', ['Bioinformatics', 'Computational Biology', 'Science and Medical Education'], [u'ZBIT Center for Bioinformatics, University of T\xfcbingen', u'Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology and Eberhart Karls University Tuebingen, International Max Planck Research School From Molecules to Organisms', u'CeMeT GmbH']]
[u'The influence of age and anthropometric variables on winning and losing in professional mixed martial arts', ['Christopher Kirk'], u'2016-08-22', u'Anthropometry and chronological age has been demonstrated to have an effect on individual performance in competitive sport, with the relationship between stature and wingspan being found to be selective criteria in many sports, although evidence for this in MMA is negligible. In this study, n = 278 professional MMA bouts were analysed with the winners and losers being compared in terms of chronological age, stature, wingspan, stature-to-wingspan ratio (S:W) and method of win/loss using paired samples t tests, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, one way ANOVAs, Kruskal-Wallis tests (all \u2264 .05) and Bayes Factor (BF 10). The results showed that for the most part anthropometric differences have no effect on who wins the bout, but taller bout losers are most likely to lose via strikes. The exception to this is at welterweight where taller participants were most likely to win, but with an anecdotal BF 10. Also at welterweight, participants with greater wingspans were most likely to lose via submission. Across the full cohort and several competitive divisions, it was found that older participants are significantly more likely to lose, and are also significantly more likely to lose via strikes. Participants who won via decision were found to be significantly older than those who won via strikes or submission.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2380/', ['Kinesiology', 'Statistics'], [u'Sport and Business Services, Burnley College']]
