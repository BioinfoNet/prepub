[u'Detecting sedimentation impacts to coral reefs resulting from dredging the Port of Miami, Florida USA', ['Margaret W Miller', 'Jocelyn Karazsia', 'Carolyn E Groves', 'Sean Griffin', 'Tom Moore', 'Pace Wilber', 'Kurtis Gregg'], u'2016-06-21', u'The federal channel at Port of Miami, Florida, USA, was dredged between late 2013 and early 2015, to widen and deepen the channel. While the precise effects of the dredging on surrounding coral reefs are not well quantified, previously published remote sensing analyses, as well as agency and anecdotal reports suggest the most severe and largest area of sedimentation occurred on a coral reef feature referred to as the Inner Reef, particularly in the sector north of the channel. A regional warm-water mass bleaching event followed by a coral disease outbreak during this same time frame confounded the assessment of dredging-related impacts to coral reefs adjacent to the federal channel. In-water field assessments conducted after the completion of dredging and a time series analysis of tagged corals photographed pre-, during, and post-dredging, are used to discern dredging-related sedimentation impacts for the Inner Reef north. Results indicate increased sediment accumulation, severe in certain times and places, and an associated biological response, including significantly greater proportion of live coral tissue loss, occurred within coral reef sites located closer to the channel. Dredging projects near valuable and sensitive habitats subject to local and global stressors require monitoring methods capable of discerning non-dredging related impacts and adaptive management to ensure predicted and unpredicted project-related impacts are quantified. Anticipated increasing frequency and intensity of warming stress also suggests that manageable- but- unavoidable local stressors such as dredging should be partitioned from the warmest times of year.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2146/', ['Environmental Sciences', 'Marine Biology'], [u'Southeast Fisheries Science Center, NOAA-National Marine Fisheries Service', u'Southeast Regional Office, NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service', u'Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences, University of Miami', u'NOAA-National Marine Fisheries Service, Southeast Fisheries Science Center', u'Restoration Center, NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service', u'Earth Resources Technology, Inc.', u'Southeast Regional Office, NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service']]
[u'Refining the reaction mechanism of O2 towards its substrate in cofactor-free dioxygenases', ['Pedro J Silva'], u'2016-06-21', u'Cofactor-less oxygenases perform challenging catalytic reactions between singlet substrates and triplet oxygen, in spite of apparently violating the spin-conservation rule. In bacterial ring-cleaving 2,4-dioxygenase, the active site has been suggested by quantum chemical computations to fine tune triplet oxygen reactivity, allowing it to interact rapidly with its singlet substrate without the need for spin inversion, and in urate oxidase the reaction is thought to proceed through electron transfer from the deprotonated substrate to an aminoacid sidechain, which then feeds the electron to the oxygen molecule. In this work, we perform additional quantum chemical computations on these two systems to elucidate several intriguing features unaddressed by previous workers. These computations establish that in both enzymes the reaction proceeds through direct electron transfer from substrate to O2 followed by radical recombination, instead of minimum-energy crossing points between singlet and triplet potential energy surfaces without formal electron transfer. The active site does not affect the reactivity of oxygen directly but is crucial for the generation of the deprotonated form of the substrates, which have redox potentials far below those of their protonated forms and therefore may transfer electrons to oxygen without sizeable thermodynamic barriers. This mechanism seems to be shared by most cofactor-less oxidases studied so far.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2145/', ['Biochemistry'], [u'FP-ENAS/Fac. de Ci\xeancias da Sa\xfade, Universidade Fernando Pessoa']]
