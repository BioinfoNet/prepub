The historical context of the expedition and the study of its collected material are described. Biographical data is given for the main persons involved. The land snails were previously studied by Joaquin Hidalgo between 1867 and 1893. A total of 3470 specimens belonging to 211 species are treated in this paper. Of 34 species mentioned by Hidalgo is his catalogue, the corresponding material could not be located. A lectotype is now designated for Drymaeus (Drymaeus) chanchamayensis (Hidalgo, 1870); Bulimus visendus Hidalgo, 1869 is now placed in the genus Synapterpes Pilsbry, 1896, a new combination.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2667/', ['Biogeography', 'Taxonomy', 'Zoology'], [u'Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences', u'Naturalis Biodiversity Center', u'Museo Nacional de Historia Natural']]

This document provides a standard field protocol for screening disease resistance traits in the imperiled coral species, Acropora palmata and Acropora cervicornis, particularly genotypes under nursery culture for population enhancement. It is intended to be implemented by practitioners and researchers in coral restoration and provide standardized information on disease resistance that can aid in the design and success of population enhancement efforts.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2668/', ['Conservation Biology', 'Ecology', 'Marine Biology'], [u'NOAA-National Marine Fisheries Service, Southeast Fisheries Science Center', u'Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences, Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies, University of Miami']]
