[u'10 simple rules for experimental design in ecology', ['Neha Saini'], u'2016-09-17', u'This article contains proposed guidelines for ensuring proper experimental design in ecology. In a sequential fashion, it is important to begin with stating a hypothesis, followed by clearly defining terms and choosing appropriate samples and parameters. Following the tips and guidelines in order will help guide the researchers thought process when designing an ecological experiment. Consult the listed citations for in-depth explanations when required. The rules may be generalized to other fields of science.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2455/', ['Biodiversity', 'Ecology', 'Ecosystem Science', 'Environmental Sciences'], [u'Department of Biology, York University']]
[u'Engineering permanence in finite systems', ['Daniel Bilar'], u'2016-09-17', u'The man-machine integration era (MMIE) is marked by sensor ubiquity, whose readings map human beings to finite numbers. These numbers - processed by continuously changing, optimizing/learning, finite precision, closed loop, distributed systems - are used to drive decisions such as insurance rates, prison sentencing, health care allocations and probation guidelines. Optimization and system parameter tuning is increasingly left to machine learning and applied AI. One challenges we face is thus: Ensuring the indelibility, the permanence, the infinite value of human beings as optimization-resistant invariants in such system environments.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2454/', ['Human-Computer Interaction', 'Adaptive and Self-Organizing Systems', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Optimization Theory and Computation', 'Software Engineering'], [u'Information Systems, Norwich University']]
