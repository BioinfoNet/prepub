[u'Testing the link between genome size and growth rate in maize', ['Maud I Tenaillon', 'Domenica Manicacci', 'Stephane D Nicolas', 'Francois Tardieu', 'Claude Welcker'], u'2016-08-02', u'Little is known about the factors driving within species Genome Size (GS) variation. GS may be shaped indirectly by natural selection on development and adaptative traits. Because GS variation is particularly pronounced in maize, we have sampled 83 maize inbred lines from three well described genetic groups adapted to contrasted climate conditions: inbreds of tropical origin , Flint inbreds grown in temperate climates, and Dent inbreds distributed in the Corn Belt. As a proxy for growth rate, we measured the Leaf Elongation Rate maximum during nighttime (LERmax) as well as GS in all inbred lines. In addition we combined available and new nucleotide polymorphism data at 29,090 sites to characterize the genetic structure of our panel. We found significant variation for both LERmax and GS among groups defined by our genetic structuring. Tropicals displayed larger GS than Flints while Dents exhibited intermediate values. LERmax followed the opposite trend with greater growth rate in Flints than in Tropicals. In other words, LERmax and GS exhibited a significantly negative correlation (r=-0.27). However, this correlation was driven by among-group variation rather than within-group variation \u2013 it was no longer significant after controlling for structure and kinship among inbreds. Our results indicate that selection on GS may have accompanied ancient maize diffusion from its center of origin, with large DNA content excluded from temperate areas. Whether GS has been targeted by more intense selection during modern breeding within groups remains an open question. <!--[if !supportLineBreakNewLine]--> <!--[endif]-->', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2333/', ['Evolutionary Studies', 'Plant Science'], [u'G\xe9n\xe9tique Quantitative et Evolution \u2013 Le Moulon, INRA - Universit\xe9 Paris-Sud - CNRS - AgroParisTech, Universit\xe9 Paris-Saclay', u'Ecophysiologie des Plantes sous Stress Environnementaux, INRA']]
[u'1H Nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabolomic study for Cabernet Sauvignon wines in different vintages', ['Boran Hu', 'Qi Zhao', 'Yaqing Yue', 'Jiangyu Zhu', 'Guangnian Lu', 'Hua Li', 'Fengmin Zhang', 'W.

The pattern recognition methods of principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) clearly distinguished vintages of wine, driven by the following metabolites: valine,2,3-butanediol, ethyl acetate, proline, succinic acid, lactic acid, acetic acid, glycerol, gallic acid and choline. The PLS-DA loading plots also differentiated between the metabolites of different vintages. The highest levels of valine, 2,3-butanediol, gallic acid and proline were found in the 2009 vintage wines. The 2011 vintage wines contained the highest levels of lactic acid, and the highest levels of ethyl acetate, succinic acid, glycerol and choline were detected in the 2012 vintage wines. A total of 8 metabolites were selected from the 1H NMR spectra and quantified according to their peak areas, yielding concentrations in a greement with the PLS-DA results.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2332/', ['Agricultural Science', 'Biochemistry', 'Food Science and Technology'], [u'College of Food Science and Engineering, Yangzhou University', u'Testing Center of Yangzhou University, Yangzhou University', u'Department of Earth Sciences, Northern Melbourne Institute of TAFE']]

In this study, we have utilised next generation RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) to analyse the transcriptome of a panel of non-melanoma skin cancer lesions, identifying genes, which are consistently expressed across all samples. Genes encoding ribosomal proteins were amongst the most stable in this dataset. Validation of this RNA-seq data was examined using qPCR to confirm the suitability of a set of highly stable genes for use as RGs. These genes will provide a valuable resource for the normalisation of qPCR data for the analysis of non-melanoma skin cancer.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2331/', ['Genomics', 'Molecular Biology', 'Dermatology', 'Oncology', 'Medical Genetics'], [u'Dermatology Research Center, School of Medicine, Translational Research Institute, Princess Alexandra Hospital, The University of Queensland', u'Garvan Institute of Medical Research', u"St Vincent's Clinical School, University of New South Wales", u'Wellman Centre for Photomedicine, Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts General Hospital', u'Diamantina Institute, University of Queensland', u'Diamantina Institute, Translational Research Institute, Princess Alexandra Hospital, The University of Queensland']]
