[u'Cytokine regulation of stem cells', ['Gyanesh Singh', 'Hasan Korkaya'], u'2016-08-09', u'Different types of stem cells are targeted by a number of cytokines that alter proliferation, differentiation, or other properties of stem cells. Stem cells are known to express various cytokine genes. As IL-12, IL-14, G-CSF, and GM-CSF expression is lost after the differentiation of MSCs, these factors might have major contribution to pluripotency. Several other cytokines that are produced by immune cells, frequently target stem cells. Modulation of stem cell functions by cytokines can be a cause of various diseases including cancer. Stem cells can show immunosuppressive properties by a number of mechanisms. MSC-induced immunosuppression is often mediated by IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b1, or IL-1\u03b2. In co-culture experiments, MSCs were able to control T cells IL-2 response, or, dendritic cells TNF-\u03b1 and IL-10 secretion. MSCs are also known to cause decreased interferon \u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) and increased IL-4 production by immune cells. However, the outcome in most of the cases depends on the presence of various factors that might synergize or antagonize with each other.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2347/', ['Allergy and Clinical Immunology', 'Immunology'], [u'School of Biotechnology and Biosciences, Lovely Professional University', u'Cancer Center, Georgia Regents University,']]
[u'Sexual reproduction in the Caribbean coral genus Isophyllia (Scleractinia: Mussidae) in Puerto Rico', ['Derek Soto', 'Ernesto Weil'], u'2016-08-09', u'The sexual pattern, reproductive mode, and timing of reproduction of Isophyllia sinuosa and Isophyllia rigida, two Caribbean Mussids, were assessed by histological analysis of specimens collected monthly during 2000-2001. Results indicate that both species are simultaneous hermaphroditic brooders, with a single annual gametogenetic cycle. Spermatocytes and oocytes of different stages were found within the same mesentery indicating sequential maturation for extended planulation. Oocytes begin development 7-8 months prior to spermaries; beginning in May in I. sinuosa and August in I. rigida. Gametes of both sexes matured simultaneously; May-June in I. rigida and March-April in I. sinuosa. Planulae were observed in I. sinuosa during April and in I. rigida from June through September. Significantly higher polyp and mesenterial fecundity were found in I. rigida compared to I. sinuosa. Significantly larger oocyte sizes were found in I. sinuosa than in I. rigida, however significantly larger planula sizes were I. rigida compared to I. sinuosa. Hermaphroditism is the exclusive sexual pattern within the Mussidae; brooding has also been documented within the related Mussid genera Mussa, Scolymia and Mycetophyllia. These results represent the first description of the sexual characteristics of I. rigida and refute the previous description for I. sinuosa.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2346/', ['Developmental Biology', 'Marine Biology', 'Zoology'], [u'Department of Marine Science, Universidad de Puerto Rico,  Recinto de Mayag\xfcez']]
