[u'Object recognition using hybrid boosting method', ['Osama Ashfaq'], u'2016-07-03', u'Li (ICCV, 2005) proposed a novel generative/discriminative way to combine features with different types and use them to learn labels in the images. However, the mixture of Gaussian used in Li\u2019s paper suffers greatly from the curse of dimensionality. Here I propose an alternative approach to generate local region descriptor. I treat GMM with diagonal covariance matrix and PCA as separate features, and combine them as the local descriptor. In this way, we could reduce the computational time for mixture model greatly while score greater 90% accuracies for caltech-4 image sets.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2220/', ['Computer Vision'], [u'Department of Computer Engineering, Bahria University']]
[u'Transferability of the Assessment of Positive Occupation 15 in elderly people with physical disabilities', ['Takuya Noguchi', 'Makoto Kyougoku'], u'2016-07-03', u'Purpose\n\nThe present study aimed to verify the reliability and validity of the Assessment of Positive Occupation 15 (APO-15) in elderly individuals with physical disabilities in health science.\n\nMethods\n\nThe study sample comprised 761 elderly individuals with physical disabilities residing in community dwellings, hospitals, and group homes. They completed the APO-15 and Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K6) evaluations. We analyzed the psychometric properties of the APO-15, polyserial correlation coefficient, and average extracted variance, which included a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), entropy, Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 coefficient, Pearson\u2019s product\u2013moment correlation coefficient, item response theory (IRT), cut-off point, and latent rank values.\n\nResults\n\nThe study outcome supported the APO-15, a 15-item, 4-factor model incorporating positive relationships, achievement, meaning, and engagement. The validity of this model was supported by various results; for example, each item score of polyserial correlation coefficient and entropy of APO-15 was the reference value was confirmed as being higher. The structural validity of APO-15 was assessed by CFA, which indicated a good model fit. Hypothesis testing revealed good values for the convergent and discriminant validity of the APO-15, and Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 coefficient analysis revealed acceptable internal consistency. These results showed that the 4-factor structure of APO-15, which assumes has been established. Cut-off points for APO-15 of 51-point sensitivity (0.512) and specificity (0.704) yielded good results. The latent rank theory of APO-15 exhibited a good fit in all four rank values. The item reference profile suggested that an effective occupation promotes well-being.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe APO-15 exhibited good psychometric properties with respect to measuring positive occupations in individuals, including elderly individuals, with physical disabilities. This important tool will facilitate participation in occupations that promote daily well-being.', u'https://peerj.com/preprints/2219/', ['Nursing', 'Psychiatry and Psychology', 'Statistics'], [u'Graduate School of Health Sciences, Kibi International University', u'Zikei Hospital', u'Department of Occupational Therapy, School of Health Sciences, Kibi International University']]
