[u'Rhythmic modulation of visual contrast discrimination triggered by action', ['Alessandro Benedetto', 'Donatella Spinelli', 'Concetta Morrone'], u'2016-04-23T13:45:34Z', u'Recent evidence suggests that ongoing brain oscillations may be instrumental in binding and integrating multisensory signals. In the present experiment, we investigated the temporal dynamics of visual-motor integration processes. We show that action modulates sensitivity to visual contrast discrimination in a rhythmic fashion at frequencies of about 5Hz (in the theta range), for up to one second after execution of action. To understand the origin of the oscillations, we measured oscillations in contrast sensitivity at different levels of luminance, which is known to affect the endogenous brain rhythms, boosting the power of alpha-frequencies. We found that the frequency of oscillation in sensitivity increased at low-luminance, likely reflecting the shift in mean endogenous brain rhythm towards higher frequencies. Importantly, both at high and at low luminance, contrast discrimination showed a rhythmic motor-induced suppression effect, with the suppression occurring earlier at low luminance. We suggest that oscillations play a key role in sensory-motor integration, and that the motor-induced suppression may reflect the first manifestation of a rhythmic oscillation.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Rhythmic_modulation_of_visual_contrast_discrimination_triggered_by_action/3144508', [u'Behavioral Neuroscience'], []]

Local techniques for estimating more quantitative features of the tissue microstructure exist, but their combination with tractography has always been considered intractable. Recent advances in local and global modeling made it possible to fill this gap and a number of promising techniques for microstructure informed tractography have been suggested, opening new and exciting perspectives for the quantification of brain connectivity. The ease-of-use of the proposed solutions made it very attractive for researchers to include such advanced methods in their analyses; however, this apparent simplicity should not hide some critical open questions raised by the complexity of these very high-dimensional problems, otherwise some fundamental issues may be pushed into the background. The aim of this article is to raise awareness in the diffusion MRI community, notably researchers working on brain connectivity, about some potential pitfalls and modeling choices that make the interpretation of the outcomes from these novel techniques rather cumbersome. Through a series of experiments on synthetic and real data, we illustrate practical situations where erroneous and severely biased conclusions may be drawn about the connectivity if these pitfalls are overlooked, like the presence of partial/missing/duplicate fibers or the critical importance of the diffusion model adopted. Microstructure informed tractography is a young but very promising technology, and by acknowledging its current limitations as done in this paper, we hope our observations will trigger further research in this direction and new ideas for truly quantitative and biologically meaningful analyses of the connectivity.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Microstructure_informed_tractography_pitfalls_and_open_challenges/3394990', [u'Neuroscience', u'Image Processing', u'Neurosciences', u'Applied Mathematics', u'Optimisation'], []]

[u'Omapatrilat', ['Amy Winfiled'], u'2016-05-30T07:22:23Z', u'Omapatrilat is an antihypertensive drug which acts by inhibiting angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase. ACE a zinc-containing carbopeptidase, catalyzes the conversion of the decapeptide angiotensin I (AI) to the octapeptide angiotensin II (AII). AII is a potent vasoconstrictor which also triggers the release of aldosterone, a sodium-retaining steroid. Thus ACE raises blood pressure by increasing both vascular resistance and \ufb02uid volume. Effective inhibitors of ACE have been used not only in the treatment of hypertension but in the clinical management of congestive heart failure. Neutral endopeptidase (NEP), like ACE, is a zinc metalloprotease and is found in high concentration in the brush border of the renal proximal tubule.

[u'MicroRNA binding motifs identification methods', ['Wenfa Ng'], u'2015-09-17T05:55:05Z', u'Identification of microRNA (miRNA) target recognition and binding motifs (miRNA response elements, MRE) is a major unsolved problem in non-coding RNA (ncRNA) research, given its myriad and important implications in post-transcriptional gene regulation and, by extension, physiological effects. While evolution is a central theme permeating biology, attempts at identifying a conserved canonical binding sequence between miRNA and mRNA targets reveal that a variety of non-canonical interactions likely dominate those dependent on a defined \u201cseed\u201d sequence in the 5\u2019 end of miRNA. Such non-canonical interactions include bulges, G:U wobbles and even seedless interactions, and could occur in the 5\u2019 untranslated region (UTR), 3\u2019 UTR, promoter and even coding DNA sequence (CDS). Experimental techniques for isolating miRNA-mRNA interactions, and determination of binding sequence, typically involves the formation of the Agonaute protein-dependent RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), followed by crosslinking, antibody-mediated pulldown, RNase and proteinase digestion, and finally, readout by next-generation short-read sequencing. Nevertheless, computational structural and energetics studies are critical for deducing the miRNA binding motif from sequenced reads. The slides presented here summarize several contemporary approaches for characterizing miRNA-target interactions, and elucidating binding motifs from the experimental and computational perspectives. Crosslinking and immunoprecipitation approaches include (High throughput sequencing of isolates from crosslinking and immunoprecipitation, HITS-CLIP), (Crosslinking and immunoprecipitation-sequencing, CLIP-Seq), (Photoactivable ribonucleoside enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation, PAR-CLIP), and (Crosslinking, ligation and sequencing of hybrids, CLASH), while computational algorithms featured are miRanda and TargetScan. Key features of each technique are provided, and the slides should be useful from the educational viewpoint, in introducing students to miRNA-mRNA heteroduplex isolation and binding sequence identification methods in either a molecular biology or life sciences techniques course.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/MicroRNA_binding_motifs_identification_methods/1373962', [u'Molecular Biology', u'Education'], []]

Indium sulfide thin films were deposited onto molybdenum-coated glass (SiO2) substrates by electrodeposition from organic baths (ethylene glycol-based) containing indium chloride (InCl3), sodium chloride (NaCl), and sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O 3.5H2O), the latter used as an additional sulfur source along with elemental sulfur (S). The Taguchi method was used to optimize the deposition paramters so as to minimize non-uniformity, cracks, and improper stoichiometry. The measured performance characteristics (molar ratio (In:S) and crack density) for all of the In2S3 films were calculated to analyze the effect of each deposition factor (deposition voltage, deposition temperature, composition of solution, and deposition time) involved in the electrodeposition process by calculating the sensitivity (signal to noise, S/N, ratios).', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Statistical_Analysis_of_Electroplated_Indium_III_Sulfide_In_2_S_3_Films_a_Potential_Buffer_Material_for_PV_Heterojunction_Solar_Cells_Systems_using_Organic_Electrolytes/1394715', [u'Solar System, Solar Physics, Planets and Exoplanets', u'Electrochemistry', u'Optical Properties of Materials', u'Physical Chemistry of Materials', u'Synthesis of Materials', u'Metals and Alloy Materials', u'Materials Engineering', u'Engineering Instrumentation', u'Energy Generation, Conversion and Storage Engineering'], []]

In2S3 has emerged as a promising low-hazard buffer (or window) material, and has proven to improve the properties of the solar cells, while reducing toxicity. Various deposition techniques have been employed to synthesize In2S3 films on different types of substrates. Until now, atomic layer deposition (ALD) and ionic layer gas atomic reaction (ILGAR) techniques have been the two most successful, yielding maximum energy conversion efficiencies up to 16.4% and 16.1%, respectively. The impact of varied deposition parameters upon the In2S3 film properties and performance of cadmium (Cd)-free solar cells has been outlined. A comparative/operational analysis (solar cell efficiencies above 9% reported for cell area \u2264 1cm2) of various buffer layers used in two primary types of TFSC technology: chalcopyrite (CIS/CIGS)- and CdTe-based solar cells was also performed to measure the progress of In2S3 compared to its counterparts.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Progress_in_Indium_III_Sulfide_In2S3_Buffer_Layer_Deposition_Techniques_for_CIS_CIGS_and_CdTe_based_Thin_Film_Solar_Cells/1500799', [u'Solar System, Solar Physics, Planets and Exoplanets', u'Chemical Characterisation of Materials', u'Electrochemistry', u'Crystallography', u'Optical Properties of Materials', u'Synthesis of Materials', u'Elemental Semiconductors', u'Energy Generation, Conversion and Storage Engineering', u'Materials Engineering', u'Metals and Alloy Materials'], []]

Many of these analyses depend on the existence or creation of a reference genome, or a construction of sequence data into a representation of the target organism\u2019s genome. However, genome assembly tools cannot distinguish between the target organism and any contaminants that may have been sequenced at the same time. In addition, it is not feasible to isolate most target organisms from any parasites, symbionts, or other potential contaminants. Thus, new methods must be devised. Here, we use NGS data from an inbred line of C. remanei known as PX356 to compare three methods for filtering DNA sequence data for assembly.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Computational_Methods_for_Filtering_Contaminants_from_NGS_Data/3439580', [u'Bioinformatics'], []]

In most studies to date, only one particular 1D\u2009scheme is tested. In this paper, we present a systematic comparison of six commonly used numerical schemes for 1D\u2009blood flow modelling: discontinuous Galerkin, locally conservative Galerkin, Galerkin least-squares finite element method, finite volume method, finite difference MacCormack method and a simplified trapezium rule method. Comparisons are made in a series of six benchmark test cases with an increasing degree of complexity. The accuracy of the numerical schemes is assessed by comparison with theoretical results, three-dimensional\u2009numerical data in compatible domains with distensible walls or experimental data in a network of silicone tubes. Results show a good agreement among all numerical schemes and their ability to capture the main features of pressure, flow and area waveforms in large arteries.

Due to wide variability observed between physicians\u2019 ratings, many large-scale studies have been conducted to quantify agreement between multiple experts\u2019 ordinal classifications in common diagnostic procedures such as mammography. However, very few statistical approaches are available to assess agreement in these large-scale settings. Existing summary measures of agreement rely on extensions of Cohen\u2019s kappa [1 - 5]. These are prone to prevalence and marginal distribution issues, become increasingly complex for more than three experts or are not easily implemented. Here we propose a model-based approach to assess agreement in large-scale studies based upon a framework of ordinal generalized linear mixed models. A summary measure of agreement is proposed for multiple experts assessing the same sample of patients\u2019 test results according to an ordered categorical scale. This measure avoids some of the key flaws associated with Cohen\u2019s kappa and its extensions. Simulation studies are conducted to demonstrate the validity of the approach with comparison to commonly used agreement measures.

However, a fundamental challenge is that it is unlikely that variables of interest are measured the same way in all of the studies to be combined. We propose that this situation can be viewed as a missing data problem in which some outcomes are entirely missing within some trials, and use multiple imputation to fill in missing measurements. We apply our method to 5 longitudinal adolescent depression trials where 4 studies used one depression measure and the fifth study used a different depression measure. None of the 5 studies contained both depression measures. We describe a multiple imputation approach for filling in missing depression measures that makes use of external calibration studies in which both depression measures were used.

In conventional multidimensional NMR experiments, such as the 1H-13C HSQC, the resolution in the indirect dimensions is typically 10 to 100 times lower as in 1D spectra because it is limited by the experimental time. Reducing the spectral window can significantly increase the resolution, but at the cost of ambiguities in frequencies as a result of spectral aliasing. Fortunately, this information is not completely lost, and can be retrieved using methods in which chemical shifts are encoded in the aliased spectra and decoded after processing to reconstruct high-resolution 1H-13C HSQC spectrum with full spectral width and a resolution similar to that of 1D spectra. We applied a new reconstruction method called RHUMBA to spectra obtained using the DENA-HSQC and the new AMNA-HSQC experiments. The reconstructed spectra significantly facilitates both manual and automated spectral analysis and structure elucidation based on heteronuclear 2D experiments.

In Trypanosoma brucei, SUMO is essential in procyclic and bloodstream forms. Furthermore, SUMO has been linked to the antigenic variation process, as a highly SUMOylated focus was recently identified within chromatin-associated proteins of the active VSG expression site. We aimed to establish a reliable strategy to identify SUMO conjugates in T. brucei. We expressed various tagged variants of SUMO from the endogenous locus. His-HA-TbSUMO was useful to validate the tag functionality but SUMO conjugates were not enriched enough over contaminants after affinity purification. A Lys-deficient SUMO version, created to reduce contaminants by Lys-C digestion, was able to overcome this issue but did not allow mapping many SUMOylation sites. This cell line was in turn useful to demonstrate that polySUMO chains are not essential for parasite viability. Finally, a His-HA-TbSUMOT106K version allowed the purification of SUMO conjugates and, after digestion with Lys-C, the enrichment for diGly-Lys peptides using specific antibodies. This site specific proteomic strategy led us to identify 45 SUMOylated proteins and 53 acceptor sites unambiguously.

How HDAC1 is targeted to defense gene promoters is unknown. Ankyrin A (AnkA), an A. phagocytophilum T4SS effector, enters the granulocyte nucleus, binds stretches of AT-rich DNA and alters transcription of antimicrobial defense genes, including downregulation of CYBB. Here we found AnkA binds to a predicted matrix attachment region in the proximal CYBB promoter. Using the CYBB promoter as a model of cis-gene silencing, we interrogated the mechanism of AnkA-mediated CYBB repression. The N-terminus of AnkA was critical for nuclear localization, the central ANK repeats and C-terminus were important for DNA binding, and most promoter activity localized to the central ANK repeats. Furthermore, a direct interaction between AnkA and HDAC1 was detected at the CYBB promoter, and was critical for AnkA-mediated CYBB repression.

In other words, there are many domains of creativity\n(science, arts, mathematics, culinary, etc); many personality and cognitive\nfactors influence creativity (positively or negatively), and its variation\nbetween individuals is due to many genes. The aim of this study is to build a\nmodel of creative potential based on the evidence accumulated in the literature\nand to investigate the genetic and environmental influences on creative\npotential. Results confirm that creative achievement is the result of high\nintelligence, high openness to experience and novelty seeking, and divergent\nthinking. This study also finds support for the positive link between\npsychopathology and creativity, but it suggests that intelligence can mask this\nassociation, via a possible detrimental role on cognition of sub-clinical\nschizophrenia lying on a continuous spectrum going from mental health to\ninsanity. A verbal measure of divergent thinking was found to be highly heritable\n(67%), with no shared environmental contribution. However, lower heritabilities\nwere found for latent personality factors Openness/Novelty Seeking (0-28%) and\nImpulsivity (26%), but higher for\xa0\nSchizophrenia (52.6%) with no significant shared environmental\ncontribution.

Automation generally accelerated assays and required less user intervention while producing comparable results. Automated protocols were validated for planktonic, biofilm, and agar cultures of the oral microbe Streptococcus mutans that is commonly associated with tooth decay. Toxicity assays for the known antimicrobial compound cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) were validated against planktonic, biofilm forming, and 24 h biofilm culture conditions, and several commonly reported toxicity/antimicrobial activity measures were evaluated: the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50), the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). Using automated methods, three halide salts of cetylpyridinium (CPC, CPB, CPI) were rapidly screened with no detectable effect of the counter ion on antimicrobial activity.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Automation_of_Antimicrobial_Activity_Screening/1453182', [u'Microbiology', u'Biotechnology', u'Toxicology', u'Biological Techniques'], []]
[u'A genome-scale investigation of how sequence-, function-, and tree-based gene properties influence phylogenetic inference', ['Xing-Xing Shen'], u'2016-07-26T14:10:36Z', u'Molecular phylogenetic inference is inherently dependent on choices in both methodology and data. Many insightful studies have shown how choices in methodology, such as the model of sequence evolution or optimality criterion used, can strongly influence inference. In contrast, much less is known about the impact of choices in the properties of the data, typically genes, on phylogenetic inference. We investigated the relationships between 52 gene properties (24 sequence-based, 19 function-based, and 9 tree-based) with each other and with three measures of phylogenetic signal in two assembled data sets of 2,832 yeast and 2,002 mammalian genes. We found that most gene properties, such as evolutionary rate (measured through the percent average of pairwise identity across taxa) and total tree length, were highly correlated with each other. Similarly, several gene properties, such as gene alignment length, GC content, and the proportion of tree distance on internal branches divided by relative composition variability (treeness/RCV), were strongly correlated with phylogenetic signal. Analysis of partial correlations between gene properties and phylogenetic signal in which gene evolutionary rate and alignment length were simultaneously controlled, showed similar patterns of correlations, albeit weaker in strength. Examination of the relative importance of each gene property on phylogenetic signal identified gene alignment length, alongside with number of parsimony-informative sites and variable sites, as the most important predictors. Interestingly, the subsets of gene properties that optimally predicted phylogenetic signal differed considerably across our three phylogenetic measures and two data sets; however, gene alignment length and RCV were consistently included as predictors of all three phylogenetic measures in both yeasts and mammals. These results suggest that a handful of sequence-based gene properties are reliable predictors of phylogenetic signal and could be useful in guiding the choice of phylogenetic markers.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/A_genome-scale_investigation_of_how_sequence-_function-_and_tree-based_gene_properties_influence_phylogenetic_inference/1597710', [u'Evolutionary Biology'], []]

[u'Early ovariectomy unmasking the non-somatic origin of murine anti-A reactive IgM', ['Peter Arend'], u'2015-08-20T12:01:43Z', u'The germline encoding of a non-immune IgM molecule in\nmammals was experimentally documented for the first time by specifically timed\novariectomy of C57BL/10 mice. Although ovariectomy and castrations have been de\xadscribed\nto result in uncontrolled and/or enhanced humoral and cellular immunity,\ninvolving increasing weights of spleen and thymus with pronounced B and T cell\nproductions, the development of the mercaptoethanol-sensitive and\ncomplement-binding non-immune anti-A reactivity in murine plasma was not enhanced\nafter ovariectomy performed in C57BL/10 mice before the onset of puberty.

This study was conducted using the mist netting method to determine species diversity of fruit bats in three sampling sites in Bega Watershed, Barangay Mabuhay, Prosperidad, Agusan del Sur, Philippines. One hundred eighteen individuals comprising eight bat species were documented. Four species are endemic to the country of which one species, Ptenochirus minor, is restricted to the Mindanao Faunal Region. Megaerops wetmorei was the onlyspecies recorded with vulnerable status but was present in all sampling sites. Seriation analysis using Paleontological Statistics Software showed that there is an increasing trend of species richness from sampling sites 1 to 3. Moderate diversity was observed for the whole area (H\u2019=2.004) and site 3 was the most diverse among all sites. Cluster analysis showed that sites 2 and 3 have more similar species composition. The presence of endemic and vulnerable species suggests that Bega watershed is an area of conservation importance.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Species_diversity_of_fruit_bats_in_Bega_Watershed_Prosperidad_Agusan_del_sur_Philippines/1512359', [u'Soil Science', u'Education', u'Microbiology', u'Botany', u'Plant Biology', u'Environmental Science', u'Genetics', u'Space Science'], []]
[u'Effects of 1-methyl cyclopropene (1\u2013MCP) on ethylen production and physicochemical properties of tomato type Rapsona', ['Innspub Net', 'Ali Mohamadi Sani', 'Somayeh Sadat Mehrzad'], u'2016-08-06T13:14:23Z', u'Tomato is one of the main agricultural products in Iran. Unfortunately, about 30% of this product is ruined during the period from picking season to the consumption. High capacity of ethylene production is the main reason for rapid ripening and high level waste of tomato after production. The main purpose behind the present research was to study the impacts of different concentrations of 1-methy cyclopropen on ethylen Production and physicochemical properties of tomato type "Rapsona" picked during the color fracture. For this purpose 4 groups of tomato samples were at 20\xb0C under 0.35, 0.7, 1 and 1.35 \u03bcL/L MCP was dissolved. The fifth group was considered as the control group (without MCP), and then Total soluble solids, acidity, color and ethylene were measured. Experimental design included factorial experiment in a completely randomized design with 3 replications. Results showed that MCP solutions could control the effects of ethylene air around the tomato, sothat the concentration of ethylene accumulated in containers of various treatments was significantly reduced. MCP at concentrations of 0.35, 0.7,1 and 1/35 \u03bcL/L reduced the ethylene for about 28, 80, 200 and 420 percent respectively. Moreover, the ripening time increased and led to the delay in the redness of the fruit, so that the R value for the samples treated by 0.35, 0.7,1 and 1.35 \u03bcL/L MCP increased respectively about 5, 15, 30 and 34%. Use of MCP at concentration 0/7 \u03bcL/L and contact time of 24 hours, leads to 15-18 days delay in the ripening time of tomato. MCP at 1/35 \u03bcL/L delayed the maturity successfully, but due to the lack of color uniformity of the product, was not recommended.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Effects_of_1-methyl_cyclopropene_1_MCP_on_ethylen_production_and_physicochemical_properties_of_tomato_type_Rapsona/1480921', [u'Microbiology', u'Soil Science', u'Education', u'Biological Techniques', u'Botany', u'Agricultural Engineering', u'Zoology', u'Plant Biology', u'Environmental Science', u'Marine Biology', u'Biological Engineering', u'Planetary Geology', u'Immunology', u'Molecular Biology', u'Cell Biology', u'Evolutionary Biology'], []]

This study was performed in order to explore and identify these pests and to determine the extent of damages caused by them. Mushrooms harvested from dead palm trees and those sampled in the markets have permitted the determination of these pests and the assessment of the damages caused by them. Three kinds of pests were identified for the mushrooms harvested from the dead palm trees aswell as for the mushrooms sampled in the markets. Those are: larvae of lepidoptera, maggots of flies andmillipedes. The larvae of lepidoptera mainly attack the caps of the mushrooms. The damages consisted of bite marks (15% of cases), perforations (50% of cases) or destruction of more than half of the mushrooms (35% of cases). Myriapods are found mainly in the mushroom feet. They perforate and lodge there. Maggots of flies mainly attack mushrooms\u2019 buttons or eggs at early stages. Their action usually stops development of the mushroom\u2019s cap, foot and volva.

Acidic wastewater from Manquebad Superphosphate Fertilizer Factory (Assiut, Upper-Egypt) was applied as soil drench (200 ml/pot) at 0, 10, 20 and 30 days. Pots of gardenia were arranged in a complete randomized block design with three replicates and repeated for two successive growing seasons. Peat moss produced the best vegetative and flowering growth of gardenia which could be assigned to its low pH and high organic matter content. Rice straw-grown plants had better vegetative growth than clay-grown ones in terms of plant height, number of leaves, branches and internodes, internode length, fresh and dry weights of shoots and roots, number and diameter of flowers and possessed the highest leaf contents of phosphorus, potassium, cupper and manganese. Plants grown in clay were thicker with bigger leaves resulting in higher total leaf area, and were characterized by the highest shoot-root ratio, more flowers and higher leaf contents of chlorophylls a&b;, nitrogen and iron. The application of the acidic water improved vegetative and flowering growth and leaf nutrient content of those plants grown in both clay and rice straw. Increasing the frequency of acidic water application to 10-day interval caused a significant improvement in all vegetative and flowering characteristics and leaf nutrient content.

Pressing problems such as erosion, compaction, acidification, organic matter losses, nutrient losses and desertification reduce agricultural production capacity. SQ decline severely impacts the environment and agricultural viability, and thus ecosystems and the population\u2019s health, food security, and livelihoods. Tests to monitor air and water quality have been standardized and widely adopted internationally. Earthworms, which improve soil productivity and fertility, have a critical influence on soil structure.

Results indicated that while there was no significant difference between grazing time of sheep and rangeland plant composition, a significant relation was found between grazing time of goat and rangeland plant composition. Hence, it can be concluded that goat is not selective as they grazed plants in proportion to their forage yield and canopy cover in the field.

We outline some of the key factors that appear to\ninfluence urban pond biodiversity: land use with the local (and often\nsmall-scale) catchment, the connectivity of ponds through the landscape, and\nthe nature of emergent and riparian vegetation. We argue that all three factors\ncan be incorporated into a landscape-scale planning framework that can target\nparticular areas for creation and amelioration of pond habitats.\xa0 Such a joined-up approach is currently\nlacking from most urban planning frameworks, but could provide an opportunity\nto maximise services provided by urban wetlands at the landscape scale.\xa0 We emphasise the application of recent\necological advances in our understanding of urban ponds to management\nguidelines, which have largely come in the form of gardening guides.

Many studies have focused on the biological response of terrestrial\ntaxa and habitats to urbanization.

In this study we examined aquatic macroinvertebrate diversity (family\nand species level) and variation in community composition between 240 urban and\n782 non-urban ponds distributed across the UK. Contrary to predictions, urban\nponds supported similar numbers of invertebrate species and families compared\nto non-urban ponds. Similar gamma diversity was found between the two groups at\nboth family and species taxonomic levels. The biological communities of urban\nponds were markedly different to those of non-urban ponds and the variability\nin urban pond community composition was greater than that in non-urban ponds,\ncontrary to previous work showing homogenisation of communities in urban areas.\nPositive spatial autocorrelation was recorded for urban and non-urban ponds at\n0-50 km (distance between pond study sites) and negative spatial\nautocorrelation was observed at 100-150 km, and was stronger in urban ponds in\nboth cases. Ponds do not follow the same ecological patterns as terrestrial and\nlotic habitats (reduced taxonomic richness) in urban environments; in contrast they\nsupport high taxonomic richness and contribute significantly to regional faunal\ndiversity. Individual cities are complex structural mosaics which evolve over long\nperiods of time and are managed in diverse ways, promoting the development of a\nwide-range of environmental conditions and habitat niches in urban ponds which\ncan promote greater heterogeneity between pond communities at larger scales.

[u'Phenological shifts in hoverflies (Diptera: Syrphidae): linking measurement and mechanism', ['Christopher Hassall', 'Jennifer Owen', 'Francis Gilbert'], u'2016-08-21T22:09:22Z', u'An\nunderstanding of ecological and evolutionary responses to global environmental\nchange requires both a robust measurement of the change that is occurring and a\nmechanistic framework for understanding the drivers of that change. Such a\nrequirement provides a challenge because biological monitoring is often ad hoc,\nand mechanistic experiments are often performed under highly simplified\nconditions. This\nstudy integrates multiple datasets to evaluate our current knowledge of the\nmeasurement and mechanism of phenological shifts in a key pollinator taxon: the\nhoverflies (Diptera: Syrphidae). First, two large, complementary and\nindependent monitoring datasets are used to test for trends in phenology: an ad\nhoc national recording scheme containing >620,000 records, and standardised\nmonitoring with consistent methods over 30 years. Results show that ad hoc and\nstandardised recording data give quantitatively the same value for phenological\nadvance in hoverflies (ca. 12 days\xd7\xb0C-1 on average at the beginning of the flight\nperiod), supporting the value of biological recording for the measurement of\nglobal ecological change. While the end of the flight period appears static in\nad hoc recording, the standardised dataset suggests a similar advance as in the\nbeginning of the flight period. Second, an extensive traits dataset and a novel\ndatabase of laboratory-derived developmental data on Syrphidae (153 published\nstudies) are used to test for mechanistic patterns in phenological shifts. The\nonly species trait that influenced phenology was voltinism, where species with\nmore generations per year exhibit stronger phenological advances. We\ndemonstrate considerable variation in the laboratory-derived sensitivity to\ntemperature but this does not match field-derived measures of phenology. The results\ndemonstrate that, as for many taxa, we have a strong understanding of the\npatterns of global ecological change but that we currently lack a detailed\nmechanistic understanding of those processes despite extensive research into\nthe fundamental biology of some taxonomic groups.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Phenological_shifts_in_hoverflies_Diptera_Syrphidae_linking_measurement_and_mechanism/3749229', [u'Community Ecology (excl.

Overall the chicks showed no difference in response\nto bee and hoverfly stimuli, demonstrating no innate aversion to the Bombus alarm sound. We therefore\nconclude that (i) similarity of acoustic signals exists among Hymenoptera and\nhoverflies, (ii) acoustic aposematic signals (but not the almost identical\nmimetic signals) are effective at reducing predation, and (iii) wild birds\nexhibit learned rather than innate aversion to certain acoustic stimuli.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/A_bee_or_not_a_bee_an_experimental_test_of_acoustic_mimicry_by_hoverflies/3749226', [u'Evolutionary Biology', u'Behavioural Ecology'], []]

[u'Information, Time and the Human Mind', ['Hartmut Ising'], u'2016-03-30T09:23:51Z', u'Quantum approaches to consciousness seem to explain several but not all\nobservations in the field of mind-brain interaction. Information is introduced\nas a key to a wider world view since we have \u2013 according to\nThomas Nagel \u2013 to transcend the built-in limits of contemporary scientific\northodoxy before we may understand mind. In the macroscopic world\ninformation is limited in contrast to the capability of our mind to work with\nunlimited information in mathematics. The world of mathematical concepts with\nunlimited information is independent of time and space and the mind is an\nintermediary between the macroscopic and the mathematical world. In the\nmacroscopic world time is unidirectional while for the mind as well as in quantum\nphysics time is bidirectional. In a given experimental system a photon carries 1\nbit of information. Using a double slit gedankenexperiment it is shown that the\ntransmission of the information from the photon to the detector takes the time\nspan delta t = \u03bb/c and Planck\u2019s formula\nfor the energy of the photon can be interpreted as Planck\u2019s constant h multiplied by the elementary information flux (1bit) c/\u03bb. The time span was\ndetermined by an observer in the macroscopic world. For the photon, however, time does not flow and space is shrunk to zero. For\nthe discussion of time in quantum physical\nmeasurements these two viewpoints have to be distinguished. We may describe\nthe photon as the elementary information unit in a world independent of time\nand space. The world of the photon is evidence for the existence of the world of\nmathematical concepts which is independent of time and space. When the information is transmitted\nfrom the world of the photon to the world of the detector it is absorbed and the loss of\n1 bit information causes an increase of energy in the system. For complex information\nthe hypothesis of an extended energy conservation law is formulated. An experimental\ntest of the hypothetical equivalence of energy and information flux is necessary\nas a next step on the way which could lead to a better understanding of\nconsciousness as well as to a quantitative theory of information.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Information_Time_and_the_Human_Mind/3123175', [u'Biological Sciences', u'Biophysics', u'Biological Physics', u'Quantum Physics', u'Psychology', u'Philosophy', u'Human Information Behaviour', u'Information Engineering and Theory'], []]

ALLN-177 is an oral formulation of a recombinant, oxalate specific, microbial enzyme oxalate decarboxylase intended to treat secondary hyperoxaluria by degrading dietary oxalate in the gastrointestinal tract, thereby reducing its absorption and subsequent excretion in the urine. Methods: This double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized, cross-over, phase 1 study of ALLN-177 evaluated the tolerability of ALLN-177 and its effect on urinary oxalate excretion in 30 healthy volunteers with hyperoxaluria induced by ingestion of a high oxalate, low calcium (HOLC) diet. The primary end point was the difference in the mean 24-hour urinary oxalate excretion during the ALLN-177 treatment period compared with the placebo treatment period. Results: The daily urinary oxalate excretion increased in the study population from 27.2 \xb1 9.5 mg/day during screening to 80.8 \xb1 24.1 mg/day (mean \xb1 SD) on the HOLC diet before introducing ALLN-177 or placebo therapy for 7 days. Compared to placebo, ALLN-177 treatment reduced urinary oxalate by 11.6 \xb1 2.7 mg/day, p = 0.0002 (least squares mean \xb1 SD). Conclusions: In healthy volunteers, with diet-induced hyperoxaluria treatment with ALLN-177, when compared to placebo, significantly reduced urinary oxalate excretion by degrading dietary oxalate in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby reducing its absorption. ALLN-177 may represent a new approach for managing secondary hyperoxaluria and its complications.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/PowerPoint_Slides_for_A_Double-Blind_Placebo_Controlled_Randomized_Phase_1_Cross-Over_Study_with_ALLN-177_an_Orally_Administered_Oxalate_Degrading_Enzyme/3635727', [u'Medicine'], []]

[u'DCE-MRI-Derived Parameters in Evaluating Abraxane-Induced Early Vascular Response and the Effectiveness of Its Synergistic Interaction with Cisplatin', ['Xilin Sun'], u'2016-09-06T20:33:16Z', u'Our previous studies revealed molecular alterations of\ntumor vessels, varying from immature to mature alterations, resulting from\nAbraxane, and demonstrated that the integrin-specific PET tracer 18F-FPPRGD2\ncan be used to noninvasively monitor such changes. However, changes in the tumor\nvasculature at functional levels such as perfusion and permeability are also important\nfor monitoring Abraxane treatment outcomes in patients with cancer. The purpose\nof this study is to further investigate the vascular response during Abraxane\ntherapy and the effectiveness of its synergistic interaction with cisplatin using\nDynamic contrast enhanced-magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). Thirty MDA-MB-435\ntumor mice were randomized into three groups: PBS control (C group), Abraxane\nonly (A group), and sequential treatment with Abraxane followed by cisplatin\n(A-P group). Tumor volume was monitored based on caliper measurements. A DCE-MRI\nprotocol was performed at baseline and day 3. The Ktrans, Kep\nand Ve were calculated and compared with CD31, \u03b1-SMA, and Ki67\nhistology data. Sequential treatment with Abraxane followed by cisplatin produced\na significantly greater inhibition of tumor growth during the three weeks of\nthe observation period. Decreases in Ktrans and Kep for\nthe A and A-P groups were observed on day 3. Immunohistological staining suggested\nvascular remodeling during the Abraxane therapy. The changes in Ktrans\nand Kep values were correlated with alterations in the permeability\nof the tumor vasculature induced by the Abraxane treatment. In conclusion,\nAbraxane-mediated permeability variations in tumor vasculature can be\nquantitatively visualized by DCE-MRI, making this a\nuseful method for studying the effects of early cancer treatment, especially\nthe early vascular response. Vascular remodeling by Abraxane improves\nthe efficiency of cisplatin delivery and thus results in a favorable\ntreatment outcome.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/DCE-MRI-Derived_Parameters_in_Evaluating_Abraxane-Induced_Early_Vascular_Response_and_the_Effectiveness_of_Its_Synergistic_Interaction_with_Cisplatin/3807621', [u'Radiology and Organ Imaging'], []]

In addition, biological networks are not isolated, but there are a lot of different and complex interactions between them. Currently, there is not a database to store and explore this complexity, only a graph-based database that embraces relationships as a core aspect of its data model is able to store, process, and query connections efficiently. Therefore, analyzing biological networks with graph concepts provides us the opportunity to model a network of thousands of interacting components and gives us clues about how their organization and connection influences their function and dynamic responses.

[u'Woodlot Dataset 4', ['karandeep chahal'], u'2016-09-20T01:32:20Z', u"Using a sample size of 10 adult trees,\ncontinuous data was collected that involved adult white spruce trees and their\ntrunk diameter at breast height, canopy coverage of the sky, the distances that\nthe trees were to their closest sapling white spruce trees and also the diameter\nof the nearest sapling white spruce trees. The research was conducted in a\nwoodlot environment near Hoover house on York University campus at 4:00 pm. The\nresearchers were Karandeep, Didar and Sophia. Firstly, the diameter of an adult\ntree was calculated using a simple measuring tape and holding the tape from one\nside of the trunk to the other. Secondly, the canopy coverage involved making a\nsquare with one's index fingers and thumbs and standing under a white spruce\nadult tree. The square was then pointed upwards, toward the branches, and an\nestimation of sky coverage was recorded. Next, a sapling white spruce tree was\nfound near the adult tree and the distances between the two was calculated using\nthe transect measuring tape - holding the tape from the adult trunk to the\nsapling trunk. Lastly, the sapling tree's diameter was calculated exactly how it\nwas for the adult tree - holding the measuring tape from one side of the trunk\nto the other. It is hypothesized that the greater the dbh of an adult tree\nwould ultimately imply a greater canopy coverage area. This is because the\ngreater dbh already implies that the tree is strong and stirdy and thus would\nhave more branches for a greater coverage of the sky. It is also hypothesized\nthat the smaller the distance an adult tree is from a sapling tree, the smaller\nits canopy coverage would be for the adult tree. This is because a sapling tree\ndid not have enough nutrients to grow into an adult and most likely, if a same\nspecies tree is near it, it too will face the same environment and not grow\nwith a significantly great canopy coverage in relation to adult trees that are\nfarther away from the sapling. \xa0The\ngreatest error when collecting this data would have to include the lack of\nspace for research which ultimately did not give fully accurate\nmeasurements.", u'https://figshare.com/articles/Woodlot_Dataset_4/3840405', [u'Terrestrial Ecology'], []]

However, due to the\nunplanned nature of catastrophes, studies aimed to identify the effects of\nthese accidents on an ecosystem and its inhabitants often have imperfect study\ndesigns that are reactive rather than proactive, resulting in methodological\nand analytical challenges. On 20 April 2010, following an explosion on the Deepwater\nHorizon, a well blowout occurred on the seafloor approximately 80 km off the\nLouisiana coast in the Gulf of Mexico. This blowout resulted in the largest\nmarine oil spill in United States history, which impacted critical migratory\nstopover and overwintering habitat for many seabird and shorebird species,\nincluding species of high conservation concern such as the piping plover (Charadrius melodus). Here, we assessed\nthe potential short-term and carry-over demographic impacts of the Deepwater\nHorizon oil spill on piping plovers in a capture-mark-recapture framework. We\nexamined whether a series of demographic processes, including probabilities of\nremaining at a specific wintering site, over-winter and annual apparent\nsurvival, winter stopover duration, and abundance varied among oiled and\nunoiled habitats. We found that the perceived amount of oiling on land, in\nwater, and on individual birds, as well as numerous demographic processes, were\nspatially or temporally variable. However, we found no support that piping\nplover demography was negatively influenced by the magnitude of oil observed at\nan impacted area, or that demographic rates substantially varied between reference\nand oil impacted areas. Nor did we find that piping plovers that were observed\nto be oiled had lower survival probabilities following the DWH oil spill\nrelative to non-oiled individuals from the same winter population. Although we\ndid not find that the Deepwater Horizon oil spill substantially influenced piping\nplovers, our methods provide an analytical framework to more appropriately\naddress both the short or long-term impacts of an anthropogenic disturbance on\na species.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Using_Demographic_Analyses_to_Evaluate_the_Impact_of_Man-made_Disasters_on_Imperiled_Species_Piping_Plovers_and_the_Deepwater_Horizon_Oil_Spill/3799182', [u'Population Ecology'], []]

[u'Fusione tra Vescicole Come Modello di Processi Cellulari', ['Filippo Caschera'], u'2016-09-20T15:39:19Z', u'Lo scopo di questa tesi \xe8 lo studio della fusione tra vescicole, come modello per la fusione di cellule e altri compartimenti biologici. La fusione tra compartimenti intracellulari e tra cellule \xe8 un evento fisiologico frequente che determina una variet\xe0 di processi cellulari di grande rilevanza. L\u2019unione dei gameti, la fusione dei mioblasti, il traffico vescicolare, l\u2019endocitosi e l\u2019esocitosi, la trasmissione sinaptica (solo per citare i casi pi\xf9 noti) sono tutti processi nei quali la fusione tra membrane lipidiche esercita un ruolo chiave. Nelle cellule, la fusione tra membrane \xe8 altamente controllata da sistemi proteici il cui meccanismo d\u2019azione (a livello molecolare) non \xe8 ancora completamente noto. Dal punto di vista biofisico, tuttavia, \xe8 lecito domandarsi se la fusione tra compartimenti separati da membrane possa avvenire sotto il controllo delle sole forze chimico-fisiche, che hanno verosimilmente dominato i processi di fusione tra protocellule in tempi prebiotici o comunque prima dello sviluppo dei meccanismi biomolecolari che osserviamo oggi.\xa0La fusione tra vescicole o liposomi convenzionali non \xe8 un processo spontaneo, anzi non si osserva affatto in condizioni normali. Una possibile strategia di avviamento della fusione vescicolare \xe8 basata su precursori elettrostabili di segno opposto. A tal scopo, in questa tesi si \xe8 studiata la reattivit\xe0 di vescicole lipidiche recanti carica opposta (vescicole anioniche e cationiche). Vescicole cationiche a base di didodecil dimetil ammonio bromuro (DDAB) sono fatte reagire con vescicole anioniche a base di acido oleico, al fine di determinare se \u2013 e in quali condizioni \u2013 la fusione possa aver luogo. Attraverso studi di turbidimetria, dynamic light scattering (DLS), potenziale zeta e fluorescenza si \xe8 dimostrato che la fusione tra vescicole \xe8 un processo possibile e che soggiace a un delicato equilibrio di forze contrapposte. In particolare, vescicole cationiche (POPC/DDAB 50/50) reagiscono con vescicole anioniche (POPC/oleato 20/80) con una resa di fusione fino al 25%, dipendente dal rapporto tra i reagenti. Dall\u2019analisi dei dati \xe8 possibile ipotizzare un meccanismo fusione transiente, simile a quanto noto in neurofisiologia come modello kiss-and-run di rilascio sinaptico. I risultati sono analizzati per mostrare se, e in quale misura, lo studio della fusione tra vescicole sia un utile modello per comprendere la fusione delle membrane cellulari; ed anche per mettere in luce la possibile rilevanza per le metodologie relative alla veicolazione di farmaci e alla terapia genica.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Fusione_tra_Vescicole_Come_Modello_di_Processi_Cellulari/3841251', [u'Analytical Biochemistry', u'Biophysics', u'Biotechnology', u'Biological Techniques'], []]

Sexual harassment by males is an underappreciated factor: it should at\nfirst sight increase the relative advantage of asexual reproduction by increasing\nthe cost of sex. However, if the same females can perform either sexual\nor asexual life cycles, then females trying to reproduce asexually may not\nescape harassment. If resisting male harassment is costly, it might be beneficial\nfor a female to accept a mating and undertake a sexual life cycle rather than\n\u2018insist\u2019 on an asexual one. We investigate the effects of sexual harassment on\nthe maintenance of sex under different population densities. Our model\nshows that resisting matings pays off at low population densities, which\nleads to the complete extinction of males, and thus to the evolution of comple-\ntely asexual populations. Facultative sex persists in a narrow range of slightly\nhigher densities. At high densities, selection favours giving up resisting male\nmating attempts and thus sexual reproduction takes over. These interactions\nbetween the outcomes of sexual conflict and population density suggest an\nexplanation for the rarity of facultative sex and also patterns of geographical\nparthenogenesis, where marginal environments with potentially low densities\nare associated with asexuality.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/dynamics_m/3987513', [u'Evolutionary Biology'], []]

Jelinek', 'Jacques Wainer', 'Eduardo Valle', 'Anderson Rocha'], u'2016-10-18T17:30:45Z', u'Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a complication of diabetes that can lead to blindness if not timely discovered. Automated screening algorithms have the potential to improve identification of patients who need further medical attention. However, the identification of lesions must be accurate to be useful for clinical application. The bag-of-visual-words (BoVW) algorithm employs a maximum-margin classifier in a flexible framework that is able to detect the most common DR-related lesions such as microaneurysms, cotton-wool spots and hard exudates. BoVW was developed to bypass the need for pre- and post-processing of the retinographic images, as well as the need of specific ad hoc techniques for identification of each type of lesion. An extensive evaluation of the BoVW model, using three large retinograph datasets (DR1, DR2 and Messidor) with different resolution and collected by different healthcare personnel, was performed. The results demonstrate that the BoVW classification approach can identify different lesions within an image without having to utilize different algorithms for each lesion reducing processing time and providing a more flexible diagnostic system. Our BoVW scheme is based on sparse low-level feature detection with a Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF) local descriptor, and mid-level features based on semi-soft coding with max pooling. The best BoVW representation for retinal image classification was an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) of 97.8% (exudates) and 93.5% (red lesions), applying a cross-dataset validation protocol. To assess the accuracy for detecting cases that require referral within one year, the sparse extraction technique associated with semi-soft coding and max pooling obtained an AUC of 94.2\xb12.0%, outperforming current methods. These results indicate that, for retinal image classification tasks in clinical practice, BoVW is equal and, in some instances, surpasses results obtained using dense detection (widely believed to be the best choice in many vision problems) for the low-level descriptors.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Advancing_Bag_of_Visual_Words_Representations_for_Lesion_Classification_in_Retinal_Images/953671', [u'Medicine', u'Diseases'], []]

To address this question, we need to understand\nthe constraints arising from the retinal output signals provided by distinct\nretinal ganglion cell types. It has recently been shown in the primate retina\nthat On and Off parasol ganglion cells, the cell types likely to underlie light\ndetection at the absolute visual threshold, differ fundamentally not only in\nresponse polarity, but also in the way they handle single-photon responses\noriginating in rods.

Here,\nemploying three microbial data sets of virus-host interactions covering\ncross-infectivity, culture coinfection, and single-cell coinfection (total: 6,564\nmicrobial hosts, 13,103 viruses), I found evidence that ecology and virus-virus\ninteractions are recurrent factors shaping coinfection patterns. Host ecology\nwas a consistent and strong predictor of coinfection across all three datasets:\npotential, culture, and single-cell coinfection. Host phylogeny or taxonomy was\na less consistent predictor, being weak or absent in potential and single-cell\ncoinfection models, yet it was the strongest predictor in the culture\ncoinfection model. Virus-virus interactions strongly affected coinfection. In\nthe largest test of superinfection exclusion to date, prophage infection reduced\nculture coinfection by other prophages, with a weaker effect on\nextrachromosomal virus coinfection.
