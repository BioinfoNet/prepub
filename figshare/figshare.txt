[u'Rhythmic modulation of visual contrast discrimination triggered by action', ['Alessandro Benedetto', 'Donatella Spinelli', 'Concetta Morrone'], u'2016-04-23T13:45:34Z', u'Recent evidence suggests that ongoing brain oscillations may be instrumental in binding and integrating multisensory signals. In the present experiment, we investigated the temporal dynamics of visual-motor integration processes. We show that action modulates sensitivity to visual contrast discrimination in a rhythmic fashion at frequencies of about 5Hz (in the theta range), for up to one second after execution of action. To understand the origin of the oscillations, we measured oscillations in contrast sensitivity at different levels of luminance, which is known to affect the endogenous brain rhythms, boosting the power of alpha-frequencies. We found that the frequency of oscillation in sensitivity increased at low-luminance, likely reflecting the shift in mean endogenous brain rhythm towards higher frequencies. Importantly, both at high and at low luminance, contrast discrimination showed a rhythmic motor-induced suppression effect, with the suppression occurring earlier at low luminance. We suggest that oscillations play a key role in sensory-motor integration, and that the motor-induced suppression may reflect the first manifestation of a rhythmic oscillation.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Rhythmic_modulation_of_visual_contrast_discrimination_triggered_by_action/3144508', [u'Behavioral Neuroscience'], []]

Local techniques for estimating more quantitative features of the tissue microstructure exist, but their combination with tractography has always been considered intractable. Recent advances in local and global modeling made it possible to fill this gap and a number of promising techniques for microstructure informed tractography have been suggested, opening new and exciting perspectives for the quantification of brain connectivity. The ease-of-use of the proposed solutions made it very attractive for researchers to include such advanced methods in their analyses; however, this apparent simplicity should not hide some critical open questions raised by the complexity of these very high-dimensional problems, otherwise some fundamental issues may be pushed into the background. The aim of this article is to raise awareness in the diffusion MRI community, notably researchers working on brain connectivity, about some potential pitfalls and modeling choices that make the interpretation of the outcomes from these novel techniques rather cumbersome. Through a series of experiments on synthetic and real data, we illustrate practical situations where erroneous and severely biased conclusions may be drawn about the connectivity if these pitfalls are overlooked, like the presence of partial/missing/duplicate fibers or the critical importance of the diffusion model adopted. Microstructure informed tractography is a young but very promising technology, and by acknowledging its current limitations as done in this paper, we hope our observations will trigger further research in this direction and new ideas for truly quantitative and biologically meaningful analyses of the connectivity.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Microstructure_informed_tractography_pitfalls_and_open_challenges/3394990', [u'Neuroscience', u'Image Processing', u'Neurosciences', u'Applied Mathematics', u'Optimisation'], []]

[u'Omapatrilat', ['Amy Winfiled'], u'2016-05-30T07:22:23Z', u'Omapatrilat is an antihypertensive drug which acts by inhibiting angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase. ACE a zinc-containing carbopeptidase, catalyzes the conversion of the decapeptide angiotensin I (AI) to the octapeptide angiotensin II (AII). AII is a potent vasoconstrictor which also triggers the release of aldosterone, a sodium-retaining steroid. Thus ACE raises blood pressure by increasing both vascular resistance and \ufb02uid volume. Effective inhibitors of ACE have been used not only in the treatment of hypertension but in the clinical management of congestive heart failure. Neutral endopeptidase (NEP), like ACE, is a zinc metalloprotease and is found in high concentration in the brush border of the renal proximal tubule.

[u'MicroRNA binding motifs identification methods', ['Wenfa Ng'], u'2015-09-17T05:55:05Z', u'Identification of microRNA (miRNA) target recognition and binding motifs (miRNA response elements, MRE) is a major unsolved problem in non-coding RNA (ncRNA) research, given its myriad and important implications in post-transcriptional gene regulation and, by extension, physiological effects. While evolution is a central theme permeating biology, attempts at identifying a conserved canonical binding sequence between miRNA and mRNA targets reveal that a variety of non-canonical interactions likely dominate those dependent on a defined \u201cseed\u201d sequence in the 5\u2019 end of miRNA. Such non-canonical interactions include bulges, G:U wobbles and even seedless interactions, and could occur in the 5\u2019 untranslated region (UTR), 3\u2019 UTR, promoter and even coding DNA sequence (CDS). Experimental techniques for isolating miRNA-mRNA interactions, and determination of binding sequence, typically involves the formation of the Agonaute protein-dependent RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), followed by crosslinking, antibody-mediated pulldown, RNase and proteinase digestion, and finally, readout by next-generation short-read sequencing. Nevertheless, computational structural and energetics studies are critical for deducing the miRNA binding motif from sequenced reads. The slides presented here summarize several contemporary approaches for characterizing miRNA-target interactions, and elucidating binding motifs from the experimental and computational perspectives. Crosslinking and immunoprecipitation approaches include (High throughput sequencing of isolates from crosslinking and immunoprecipitation, HITS-CLIP), (Crosslinking and immunoprecipitation-sequencing, CLIP-Seq), (Photoactivable ribonucleoside enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation, PAR-CLIP), and (Crosslinking, ligation and sequencing of hybrids, CLASH), while computational algorithms featured are miRanda and TargetScan. Key features of each technique are provided, and the slides should be useful from the educational viewpoint, in introducing students to miRNA-mRNA heteroduplex isolation and binding sequence identification methods in either a molecular biology or life sciences techniques course.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/MicroRNA_binding_motifs_identification_methods/1373962', [u'Molecular Biology', u'Education'], []]

Indium sulfide thin films were deposited onto molybdenum-coated glass (SiO2) substrates by electrodeposition from organic baths (ethylene glycol-based) containing indium chloride (InCl3), sodium chloride (NaCl), and sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O 3.5H2O), the latter used as an additional sulfur source along with elemental sulfur (S). The Taguchi method was used to optimize the deposition paramters so as to minimize non-uniformity, cracks, and improper stoichiometry. The measured performance characteristics (molar ratio (In:S) and crack density) for all of the In2S3 films were calculated to analyze the effect of each deposition factor (deposition voltage, deposition temperature, composition of solution, and deposition time) involved in the electrodeposition process by calculating the sensitivity (signal to noise, S/N, ratios).', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Statistical_Analysis_of_Electroplated_Indium_III_Sulfide_In_2_S_3_Films_a_Potential_Buffer_Material_for_PV_Heterojunction_Solar_Cells_Systems_using_Organic_Electrolytes/1394715', [u'Solar System, Solar Physics, Planets and Exoplanets', u'Electrochemistry', u'Optical Properties of Materials', u'Physical Chemistry of Materials', u'Synthesis of Materials', u'Metals and Alloy Materials', u'Materials Engineering', u'Engineering Instrumentation', u'Energy Generation, Conversion and Storage Engineering'], []]

In2S3 has emerged as a promising low-hazard buffer (or window) material, and has proven to improve the properties of the solar cells, while reducing toxicity. Various deposition techniques have been employed to synthesize In2S3 films on different types of substrates. Until now, atomic layer deposition (ALD) and ionic layer gas atomic reaction (ILGAR) techniques have been the two most successful, yielding maximum energy conversion efficiencies up to 16.4% and 16.1%, respectively. The impact of varied deposition parameters upon the In2S3 film properties and performance of cadmium (Cd)-free solar cells has been outlined. A comparative/operational analysis (solar cell efficiencies above 9% reported for cell area \u2264 1cm2) of various buffer layers used in two primary types of TFSC technology: chalcopyrite (CIS/CIGS)- and CdTe-based solar cells was also performed to measure the progress of In2S3 compared to its counterparts.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Progress_in_Indium_III_Sulfide_In2S3_Buffer_Layer_Deposition_Techniques_for_CIS_CIGS_and_CdTe_based_Thin_Film_Solar_Cells/1500799', [u'Solar System, Solar Physics, Planets and Exoplanets', u'Chemical Characterisation of Materials', u'Electrochemistry', u'Crystallography', u'Optical Properties of Materials', u'Synthesis of Materials', u'Elemental Semiconductors', u'Energy Generation, Conversion and Storage Engineering', u'Materials Engineering', u'Metals and Alloy Materials'], []]

Many of these analyses depend on the existence or creation of a reference genome, or a construction of sequence data into a representation of the target organism\u2019s genome. However, genome assembly tools cannot distinguish between the target organism and any contaminants that may have been sequenced at the same time. In addition, it is not feasible to isolate most target organisms from any parasites, symbionts, or other potential contaminants. Thus, new methods must be devised. Here, we use NGS data from an inbred line of C. remanei known as PX356 to compare three methods for filtering DNA sequence data for assembly.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Computational_Methods_for_Filtering_Contaminants_from_NGS_Data/3439580', [u'Bioinformatics'], []]

In most studies to date, only one particular 1D\u2009scheme is tested. In this paper, we present a systematic comparison of six commonly used numerical schemes for 1D\u2009blood flow modelling: discontinuous Galerkin, locally conservative Galerkin, Galerkin least-squares finite element method, finite volume method, finite difference MacCormack method and a simplified trapezium rule method. Comparisons are made in a series of six benchmark test cases with an increasing degree of complexity. The accuracy of the numerical schemes is assessed by comparison with theoretical results, three-dimensional\u2009numerical data in compatible domains with distensible walls or experimental data in a network of silicone tubes. Results show a good agreement among all numerical schemes and their ability to capture the main features of pressure, flow and area waveforms in large arteries.

Due to wide variability observed between physicians\u2019 ratings, many large-scale studies have been conducted to quantify agreement between multiple experts\u2019 ordinal classifications in common diagnostic procedures such as mammography. However, very few statistical approaches are available to assess agreement in these large-scale settings. Existing summary measures of agreement rely on extensions of Cohen\u2019s kappa [1 - 5]. These are prone to prevalence and marginal distribution issues, become increasingly complex for more than three experts or are not easily implemented. Here we propose a model-based approach to assess agreement in large-scale studies based upon a framework of ordinal generalized linear mixed models. A summary measure of agreement is proposed for multiple experts assessing the same sample of patients\u2019 test results according to an ordered categorical scale. This measure avoids some of the key flaws associated with Cohen\u2019s kappa and its extensions. Simulation studies are conducted to demonstrate the validity of the approach with comparison to commonly used agreement measures.

However, a fundamental challenge is that it is unlikely that variables of interest are measured the same way in all of the studies to be combined. We propose that this situation can be viewed as a missing data problem in which some outcomes are entirely missing within some trials, and use multiple imputation to fill in missing measurements. We apply our method to 5 longitudinal adolescent depression trials where 4 studies used one depression measure and the fifth study used a different depression measure. None of the 5 studies contained both depression measures. We describe a multiple imputation approach for filling in missing depression measures that makes use of external calibration studies in which both depression measures were used.

In conventional multidimensional NMR experiments, such as the 1H-13C HSQC, the resolution in the indirect dimensions is typically 10 to 100 times lower as in 1D spectra because it is limited by the experimental time. Reducing the spectral window can significantly increase the resolution, but at the cost of ambiguities in frequencies as a result of spectral aliasing. Fortunately, this information is not completely lost, and can be retrieved using methods in which chemical shifts are encoded in the aliased spectra and decoded after processing to reconstruct high-resolution 1H-13C HSQC spectrum with full spectral width and a resolution similar to that of 1D spectra. We applied a new reconstruction method called RHUMBA to spectra obtained using the DENA-HSQC and the new AMNA-HSQC experiments. The reconstructed spectra significantly facilitates both manual and automated spectral analysis and structure elucidation based on heteronuclear 2D experiments.

In Trypanosoma brucei, SUMO is essential in procyclic and bloodstream forms. Furthermore, SUMO has been linked to the antigenic variation process, as a highly SUMOylated focus was recently identified within chromatin-associated proteins of the active VSG expression site. We aimed to establish a reliable strategy to identify SUMO conjugates in T. brucei. We expressed various tagged variants of SUMO from the endogenous locus. His-HA-TbSUMO was useful to validate the tag functionality but SUMO conjugates were not enriched enough over contaminants after affinity purification. A Lys-deficient SUMO version, created to reduce contaminants by Lys-C digestion, was able to overcome this issue but did not allow mapping many SUMOylation sites. This cell line was in turn useful to demonstrate that polySUMO chains are not essential for parasite viability. Finally, a His-HA-TbSUMOT106K version allowed the purification of SUMO conjugates and, after digestion with Lys-C, the enrichment for diGly-Lys peptides using specific antibodies. This site specific proteomic strategy led us to identify 45 SUMOylated proteins and 53 acceptor sites unambiguously.

How HDAC1 is targeted to defense gene promoters is unknown. Ankyrin A (AnkA), an A. phagocytophilum T4SS effector, enters the granulocyte nucleus, binds stretches of AT-rich DNA and alters transcription of antimicrobial defense genes, including downregulation of CYBB. Here we found AnkA binds to a predicted matrix attachment region in the proximal CYBB promoter. Using the CYBB promoter as a model of cis-gene silencing, we interrogated the mechanism of AnkA-mediated CYBB repression. The N-terminus of AnkA was critical for nuclear localization, the central ANK repeats and C-terminus were important for DNA binding, and most promoter activity localized to the central ANK repeats. Furthermore, a direct interaction between AnkA and HDAC1 was detected at the CYBB promoter, and was critical for AnkA-mediated CYBB repression.

In other words, there are many domains of creativity\n(science, arts, mathematics, culinary, etc); many personality and cognitive\nfactors influence creativity (positively or negatively), and its variation\nbetween individuals is due to many genes. The aim of this study is to build a\nmodel of creative potential based on the evidence accumulated in the literature\nand to investigate the genetic and environmental influences on creative\npotential. Results confirm that creative achievement is the result of high\nintelligence, high openness to experience and novelty seeking, and divergent\nthinking. This study also finds support for the positive link between\npsychopathology and creativity, but it suggests that intelligence can mask this\nassociation, via a possible detrimental role on cognition of sub-clinical\nschizophrenia lying on a continuous spectrum going from mental health to\ninsanity. A verbal measure of divergent thinking was found to be highly heritable\n(67%), with no shared environmental contribution. However, lower heritabilities\nwere found for latent personality factors Openness/Novelty Seeking (0-28%) and\nImpulsivity (26%), but higher for\xa0\nSchizophrenia (52.6%) with no significant shared environmental\ncontribution. This study also provides further support for the use of a\nself-report measure of creative achievement.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/The_heritability_of_creative_potential/3498107', [u'Personality, Abilities and Assessment', u'Biological Psychology (Neuropsychology, Psychopharmacology, Physiological Psychology)', u'Genetics', u'Quantitative Genetics (incl.

[u'Automation of Antimicrobial Activity Screening', ['Samuel P Forry'], u'2016-03-08T18:00:37Z', u'Manual and automated methods were compared for routine screening of compounds for antimicrobial activity. Automation generally accelerated assays and required less user intervention while producing comparable results. Automated protocols were validated for planktonic, biofilm, and agar cultures of the oral microbe Streptococcus mutans that is commonly associated with tooth decay. Toxicity assays for the known antimicrobial compound cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) were validated against planktonic, biofilm forming, and 24 h biofilm culture conditions, and several commonly reported toxicity/antimicrobial activity measures were evaluated: the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50), the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). Using automated methods, three halide salts of cetylpyridinium (CPC, CPB, CPI) were rapidly screened with no detectable effect of the counter ion on antimicrobial activity.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Automation_of_Antimicrobial_Activity_Screening/1453182', [u'Microbiology', u'Biotechnology', u'Toxicology', u'Biological Techniques'], []]
[u'A genome-scale investigation of how sequence-, function-, and tree-based gene properties influence phylogenetic inference', ['Xing-Xing Shen'], u'2016-07-26T14:10:36Z', u'Molecular phylogenetic inference is inherently dependent on choices in both methodology and data. Many insightful studies have shown how choices in methodology, such as the model of sequence evolution or optimality criterion used, can strongly influence inference. In contrast, much less is known about the impact of choices in the properties of the data, typically genes, on phylogenetic inference. We investigated the relationships between 52 gene properties (24 sequence-based, 19 function-based, and 9 tree-based) with each other and with three measures of phylogenetic signal in two assembled data sets of 2,832 yeast and 2,002 mammalian genes. We found that most gene properties, such as evolutionary rate (measured through the percent average of pairwise identity across taxa) and total tree length, were highly correlated with each other. Similarly, several gene properties, such as gene alignment length, GC content, and the proportion of tree distance on internal branches divided by relative composition variability (treeness/RCV), were strongly correlated with phylogenetic signal. Analysis of partial correlations between gene properties and phylogenetic signal in which gene evolutionary rate and alignment length were simultaneously controlled, showed similar patterns of correlations, albeit weaker in strength. Examination of the relative importance of each gene property on phylogenetic signal identified gene alignment length, alongside with number of parsimony-informative sites and variable sites, as the most important predictors. Interestingly, the subsets of gene properties that optimally predicted phylogenetic signal differed considerably across our three phylogenetic measures and two data sets; however, gene alignment length and RCV were consistently included as predictors of all three phylogenetic measures in both yeasts and mammals. These results suggest that a handful of sequence-based gene properties are reliable predictors of phylogenetic signal and could be useful in guiding the choice of phylogenetic markers.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/A_genome-scale_investigation_of_how_sequence-_function-_and_tree-based_gene_properties_influence_phylogenetic_inference/1597710', [u'Evolutionary Biology'], []]

[u'Early ovariectomy unmasking the non-somatic origin of murine anti-A reactive IgM', ['Peter Arend'], u'2015-08-20T12:01:43Z', u'The germline encoding of a non-immune IgM molecule in\nmammals was experimentally documented for the first time by specifically timed\novariectomy of C57BL/10 mice. Although ovariectomy and castrations have been de\xadscribed\nto result in uncontrolled and/or enhanced humoral and cellular immunity,\ninvolving increasing weights of spleen and thymus with pronounced B and T cell\nproductions, the development of the mercaptoethanol-sensitive and\ncomplement-binding non-immune anti-A reactivity in murine plasma was not enhanced\nafter ovariectomy performed in C57BL/10 mice before the onset of puberty. In\nfact, this non-immune murine anti-A, which is complementary to trans-species immature,\nsyngeneic ovarian GalNAc-glycan-bearing, hydrophilic glycolipids and distinct\nfrom cross-reactive adaptive anti-A antibody, was strongly retarded or did not\nap\xadpear at all in plasmas of animals ovariectomized at the age of 20 days. Thus,\ncontrary to our previous views, this reactivity is unlikely to originate from a\nsomatic, primary immune or autoimmune response. Moreover, while all murine\ntissues expressed the expected, species-typical Forssman reactivity and further A-like structures were, by innate\nhuman anti-A antibody identified in male and female reproductive organs and\nendodermal tissues, the murine anti-A was exclusively inhibited by syngeneic\novarian glycolipids. Although the developmental\nrelationships involving primordial germ cells (PGCs), embryonic germ cells\n(ESCs) and lymphomyeloid cell lineages are not yet completely understood, the\nexplanation for these findings may reside in the topographically connected\nproduction of the trans-species-functional and germline-specific A-like GalNAc epitope and\nits complementary, ancestral IgM molecule in differentiating mammalian ovarian\ntissue.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Early_ovariectomy_unmasking_the_non_somatic_origin_of_murine_anti_A_reactive_IgM/1279394', [u'Microbiology', u'Hematology', u'Medicine', u'Biochemistry', u'Developmental Biology', u'Zoology', u'Systems Biology', u'Structural Biology', u'Stem Cells', u'Cell Biology', u'Genetics'], []]
