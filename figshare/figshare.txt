[u'Rhythmic modulation of visual contrast discrimination triggered by action', ['Alessandro Benedetto', 'Donatella Spinelli', 'Concetta Morrone'], u'2016-04-23T13:45:34Z', u'Recent evidence suggests that ongoing brain oscillations may be instrumental in binding and integrating multisensory signals. In the present experiment, we investigated the temporal dynamics of visual-motor integration processes. We show that action modulates sensitivity to visual contrast discrimination in a rhythmic fashion at frequencies of about 5Hz (in the theta range), for up to one second after execution of action. To understand the origin of the oscillations, we measured oscillations in contrast sensitivity at different levels of luminance, which is known to affect the endogenous brain rhythms, boosting the power of alpha-frequencies. We found that the frequency of oscillation in sensitivity increased at low-luminance, likely reflecting the shift in mean endogenous brain rhythm towards higher frequencies. Importantly, both at high and at low luminance, contrast discrimination showed a rhythmic motor-induced suppression effect, with the suppression occurring earlier at low luminance. We suggest that oscillations play a key role in sensory-motor integration, and that the motor-induced suppression may reflect the first manifestation of a rhythmic oscillation.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Rhythmic_modulation_of_visual_contrast_discrimination_triggered_by_action/3144508', [u'Behavioral Neuroscience'], []]

[u'Microstructure informed tractography: pitfalls and open challenges', ['Alessandro Daducci', 'Alessandro Dal Palu', 'Maxime Descoteaux', 'Jean-Philippe Thiran'], u'2016-05-23T12:02:38Z', u'One of the major limitations of diffusion MRI tractography is that the fiber tracts recovered by existing algorithms are not truly quantitative. Local techniques for estimating more quantitative features of the tissue microstructure exist, but their combination with tractography has always been considered intractable. Recent advances in local and global modeling made it possible to fill this gap and a number of promising techniques for microstructure informed tractography have been suggested, opening new and exciting perspectives for the quantification of brain connectivity. The ease-of-use of the proposed solutions made it very attractive for researchers to include such advanced methods in their analyses; however, this apparent simplicity should not hide some critical open questions raised by the complexity of these very high-dimensional problems, otherwise some fundamental issues may be pushed into the background. The aim of this article is to raise awareness in the diffusion MRI community, notably researchers working on brain connectivity, about some potential pitfalls and modeling choices that make the interpretation of the outcomes from these novel techniques rather cumbersome. Through a series of experiments on synthetic and real data, we illustrate practical situations where erroneous and severely biased conclusions may be drawn about the connectivity if these pitfalls are overlooked, like the presence of partial/missing/duplicate fibers or the critical importance of the diffusion model adopted. Microstructure informed tractography is a young but very promising technology, and by acknowledging its current limitations as done in this paper, we hope our observations will trigger further research in this direction and new ideas for truly quantitative and biologically meaningful analyses of the connectivity.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Microstructure_informed_tractography_pitfalls_and_open_challenges/3394990', [u'Neuroscience', u'Image Processing', u'Neurosciences', u'Applied Mathematics', u'Optimisation'], []]

[u'Omapatrilat', ['Amy Winfiled'], u'2016-05-30T07:22:23Z', u'Omapatrilat is an antihypertensive drug which acts by inhibiting angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase. ACE a zinc-containing carbopeptidase, catalyzes the conversion of the decapeptide angiotensin I (AI) to the octapeptide angiotensin II (AII). AII is a potent vasoconstrictor which also triggers the release of aldosterone, a sodium-retaining steroid. Thus ACE raises blood pressure by increasing both vascular resistance and \ufb02uid volume. Effective inhibitors of ACE have been used not only in the treatment of hypertension but in the clinical management of congestive heart failure. Neutral endopeptidase (NEP), like ACE, is a zinc metalloprotease and is found in high concentration in the brush border of the renal proximal tubule.

Here, we use RNA bisulfite sequencing (bsRNA-seq) for transcriptome-wide quantitative mapping of m5C in the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. We discover more than a thousand m5C sites in Arabidopsis mRNAs, long non-coding RNAs and other non-coding RNAs across three tissue types; siliques, seedling shoots and roots, and validate a number of these sites. Quantitative differences in methylated sites between these three tissues suggest tissue-specific regulation of m5C. Perturbing the RNA m5C methyltransferase TRM4B resulted in loss of m5C sites on mRNAs and non-coding RNAs and reduced the stability of tRNAAsp(GTC). We also demonstrate the importance of m5C in plant development as trm4b mutants have shorter primary roots due to reduced cell division in the root apical meristem. In addition, trm4b mutants show increased sensitivity to oxidative stress. Finally, we provide the first insights into the targeting mechanism of TRM4B by demonstrating that a 50 nt sequence flanking m5C C3349 in MAG5 mRNA is sufficient to confer methylation of a transgene reporter in Nicotiana benthamiana.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/David_et_al_2016_pdf/3408193', [u'Computational  Biology', u'Developmental Biology', u'Epigenetics (incl.

[u'MicroRNA binding motifs identification methods', ['Wenfa Ng'], u'2015-09-17T05:55:05Z', u'Identification of microRNA (miRNA) target recognition and binding motifs (miRNA response elements, MRE) is a major unsolved problem in non-coding RNA (ncRNA) research, given its myriad and important implications in post-transcriptional gene regulation and, by extension, physiological effects. While evolution is a central theme permeating biology, attempts at identifying a conserved canonical binding sequence between miRNA and mRNA targets reveal that a variety of non-canonical interactions likely dominate those dependent on a defined \u201cseed\u201d sequence in the 5\u2019 end of miRNA. Such non-canonical interactions include bulges, G:U wobbles and even seedless interactions, and could occur in the 5\u2019 untranslated region (UTR), 3\u2019 UTR, promoter and even coding DNA sequence (CDS). Experimental techniques for isolating miRNA-mRNA interactions, and determination of binding sequence, typically involves the formation of the Agonaute protein-dependent RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), followed by crosslinking, antibody-mediated pulldown, RNase and proteinase digestion, and finally, readout by next-generation short-read sequencing. Nevertheless, computational structural and energetics studies are critical for deducing the miRNA binding motif from sequenced reads. The slides presented here summarize several contemporary approaches for characterizing miRNA-target interactions, and elucidating binding motifs from the experimental and computational perspectives. Crosslinking and immunoprecipitation approaches include (High throughput sequencing of isolates from crosslinking and immunoprecipitation, HITS-CLIP), (Crosslinking and immunoprecipitation-sequencing, CLIP-Seq), (Photoactivable ribonucleoside enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation, PAR-CLIP), and (Crosslinking, ligation and sequencing of hybrids, CLASH), while computational algorithms featured are miRanda and TargetScan. Key features of each technique are provided, and the slides should be useful from the educational viewpoint, in introducing students to miRNA-mRNA heteroduplex isolation and binding sequence identification methods in either a molecular biology or life sciences techniques course.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/MicroRNA_binding_motifs_identification_methods/1373962', [u'Molecular Biology', u'Education'], []]

[u'Elemental sulfur-based electrodeposition of indium sulfide films', ['Maqsood ali Mughal'], u'2015-04-27T02:14:02Z', u"We report research on electrodeposition of indium sulfide films, with In2S3 a less hazardous alternative to CdS buffer layers in solar cells. Numerous organic and aqueous/organic electrolytes of InCl3, NaCl, and elemental sulfur were investigated, including several glycols and amides. Temperatures ranged from 80-170\xb0C, and deposition voltages from -0.6 to -1.2 V (Ag/AgCl with organic filling solution). Substrates included indium tin oxide-on-glass, molybdenum, and titanium, with indium or graphite anodes. Rapid stirring was used. Deposition was sluggish in all baths. Uniformity and adherence were only moderate, with irregular coverage and cracking-and-flaking sometimes evident. The best baths were ethylene glycol or 1, 2-propanediol-based, with golden-yellow films, nominally In2S3-xOx, depositing typically heavier around the substrate edges. With low temperatures and/or large currents, brown films more rich in indium sometimes formed. Cyclic voltammetry elucidated onset potentials, secondary reactions, and photoactivity, with the greatest anodic photocurrents arising from In2S3's n-type conductivity occurring with mixed ethylene glycol/propionic acid/water baths. Scanning electron microscope photographs indicated a compact small grain microstructure for yellow films. Energy dispersive X-ray analysis and photoelectron spectroscopy data indicate up to 15% oxygen content.", u'https://figshare.com/articles/Elemental_sulfur_based_electrodeposition_of_indium_sulfide_films/1394708', [u'Solar System, Solar Physics, Planets and Exoplanets', u'Electrochemistry', u'Electroanalytical Chemistry', u'Optical Properties of Materials', u'Physical Chemistry of Materials', u'Synthesis of Materials', u'Energy Generation, Conversion and Storage Engineering', u'Engineering Instrumentation', u'Materials Engineering', u'Metals and Alloy Materials', u'Renewable Power and Energy Systems Engineering (excl.

[u'Statistical Analysis of Electroplated Indium ( III ) Sulfide ( In 2 S 3 ) Films , a Potential Buffer Material for PV ( Heterojunction Solar Cells ) Systems , using Organic Electrolytes', ['Maqsood ali Mughal'], u'2015-04-27T02:03:00Z', u'In2S3 has received attention as an alternative to CdS as the buffer layer in heterojunction solar cells. Although having a bandgap of 2.0 eV relative to 2.5 eV for CdS, the lower toxicity and environmental impact of indium relative to cadmium, and significant photosensitivity, compel ongoing research [1]. Indium sulfide thin films were deposited onto molybdenum-coated glass (SiO2) substrates by electrodeposition from organic baths (ethylene glycol-based) containing indium chloride (InCl3), sodium chloride (NaCl), and sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O 3.5H2O), the latter used as an additional sulfur source along with elemental sulfur (S). The Taguchi method was used to optimize the deposition paramters so as to minimize non-uniformity, cracks, and improper stoichiometry. The measured performance characteristics (molar ratio (In:S) and crack density) for all of the In2S3 films were calculated to analyze the effect of each deposition factor (deposition voltage, deposition temperature, composition of solution, and deposition time) involved in the electrodeposition process by calculating the sensitivity (signal to noise, S/N, ratios).', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Statistical_Analysis_of_Electroplated_Indium_III_Sulfide_In_2_S_3_Films_a_Potential_Buffer_Material_for_PV_Heterojunction_Solar_Cells_Systems_using_Organic_Electrolytes/1394715', [u'Solar System, Solar Physics, Planets and Exoplanets', u'Electrochemistry', u'Optical Properties of Materials', u'Physical Chemistry of Materials', u'Synthesis of Materials', u'Metals and Alloy Materials', u'Materials Engineering', u'Engineering Instrumentation', u'Energy Generation, Conversion and Storage Engineering'], []]
[u'Progress in Indium (III) Sulfide (In2S3) Buffer Layer Deposition Techniques for CIS, CIGS, and CdTe-based Thin Film Solar Cells', ['Maqsood ali Mughal'], u'2015-08-02T03:23:18Z', u'Recent progress with indium (III) sulfide (In2S3)-buffered thin film solar cells (TFSC) was briefly reviewed. In2S3 has emerged as a promising low-hazard buffer (or window) material, and has proven to improve the properties of the solar cells, while reducing toxicity. Various deposition techniques have been employed to synthesize In2S3 films on different types of substrates. Until now, atomic layer deposition (ALD) and ionic layer gas atomic reaction (ILGAR) techniques have been the two most successful, yielding maximum energy conversion efficiencies up to 16.4% and 16.1%, respectively. The impact of varied deposition parameters upon the In2S3 film properties and performance of cadmium (Cd)-free solar cells has been outlined. A comparative/operational analysis (solar cell efficiencies above 9% reported for cell area \u2264 1cm2) of various buffer layers used in two primary types of TFSC technology: chalcopyrite (CIS/CIGS)- and CdTe-based solar cells was also performed to measure the progress of In2S3 compared to its counterparts.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Progress_in_Indium_III_Sulfide_In2S3_Buffer_Layer_Deposition_Techniques_for_CIS_CIGS_and_CdTe_based_Thin_Film_Solar_Cells/1500799', [u'Solar System, Solar Physics, Planets and Exoplanets', u'Chemical Characterisation of Materials', u'Electrochemistry', u'Crystallography', u'Optical Properties of Materials', u'Synthesis of Materials', u'Elemental Semiconductors', u'Energy Generation, Conversion and Storage Engineering', u'Materials Engineering', u'Metals and Alloy Materials'], []]

[u'Computational Methods for Filtering Contaminants from NGS Data', ['Duncan Murdock', 'Janna Fierst'], u'2016-06-16T20:06:09Z', u'Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies have enabled many more and more complex genomic analyses to be performed. Many of these analyses depend on the existence or creation of a reference genome, or a construction of sequence data into a representation of the target organism\u2019s genome. However, genome assembly tools cannot distinguish between the target organism and any contaminants that may have been sequenced at the same time. In addition, it is not feasible to isolate most target organisms from any parasites, symbionts, or other potential contaminants. Thus, new methods must be devised. Here, we use NGS data from an inbred line of C. remanei known as PX356 to compare three methods for filtering DNA sequence data for assembly.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Computational_Methods_for_Filtering_Contaminants_from_NGS_Data/3439580', [u'Bioinformatics'], []]
