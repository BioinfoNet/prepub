[u'Rhythmic modulation of visual contrast discrimination triggered by action', ['Alessandro Benedetto', 'Donatella Spinelli', 'Concetta Morrone'], u'2016-04-23T13:45:34Z', u'Recent evidence suggests that ongoing brain oscillations may be instrumental in binding and integrating multisensory signals. In the present experiment, we investigated the temporal dynamics of visual-motor integration processes. We show that action modulates sensitivity to visual contrast discrimination in a rhythmic fashion at frequencies of about 5Hz (in the theta range), for up to one second after execution of action. To understand the origin of the oscillations, we measured oscillations in contrast sensitivity at different levels of luminance, which is known to affect the endogenous brain rhythms, boosting the power of alpha-frequencies. We found that the frequency of oscillation in sensitivity increased at low-luminance, likely reflecting the shift in mean endogenous brain rhythm towards higher frequencies. Importantly, both at high and at low luminance, contrast discrimination showed a rhythmic motor-induced suppression effect, with the suppression occurring earlier at low luminance. We suggest that oscillations play a key role in sensory-motor integration, and that the motor-induced suppression may reflect the first manifestation of a rhythmic oscillation.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Rhythmic_modulation_of_visual_contrast_discrimination_triggered_by_action/3144508', [u'Behavioral Neuroscience'], []]

[u'Microstructure informed tractography: pitfalls and open challenges', ['Alessandro Daducci', 'Alessandro Dal Palu', 'Maxime Descoteaux', 'Jean-Philippe Thiran'], u'2016-05-23T12:02:38Z', u'One of the major limitations of diffusion MRI tractography is that the fiber tracts recovered by existing algorithms are not truly quantitative. Local techniques for estimating more quantitative features of the tissue microstructure exist, but their combination with tractography has always been considered intractable. Recent advances in local and global modeling made it possible to fill this gap and a number of promising techniques for microstructure informed tractography have been suggested, opening new and exciting perspectives for the quantification of brain connectivity. The ease-of-use of the proposed solutions made it very attractive for researchers to include such advanced methods in their analyses; however, this apparent simplicity should not hide some critical open questions raised by the complexity of these very high-dimensional problems, otherwise some fundamental issues may be pushed into the background. The aim of this article is to raise awareness in the diffusion MRI community, notably researchers working on brain connectivity, about some potential pitfalls and modeling choices that make the interpretation of the outcomes from these novel techniques rather cumbersome. Through a series of experiments on synthetic and real data, we illustrate practical situations where erroneous and severely biased conclusions may be drawn about the connectivity if these pitfalls are overlooked, like the presence of partial/missing/duplicate fibers or the critical importance of the diffusion model adopted. Microstructure informed tractography is a young but very promising technology, and by acknowledging its current limitations as done in this paper, we hope our observations will trigger further research in this direction and new ideas for truly quantitative and biologically meaningful analyses of the connectivity.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Microstructure_informed_tractography_pitfalls_and_open_challenges/3394990', [u'Neuroscience', u'Image Processing', u'Neurosciences', u'Applied Mathematics', u'Optimisation'], []]
[u'Critical role of Kupffer cell CD89 expression in experimental IgA nephropathy', ['Lijun Xu'], u'2016-05-23T09:37:23Z', u'In this study,\nwe generated a CD89 transgenic mouse strain using an authentic murine CD14\npromotor with\nCD89 expression on blood and tissue monocytes/macrophages. These animals, however,\nshowed no signs of IgAN but displayed concomitant increased clearance of mouse\nserum IgA.In\nthese experiments Kupffer cells were the predominant cell type in the\ndegradation of experimentally-induced human IgA, especially human IgA1 catabolized\nby these cells. Injecting large quantities of purified IgA from IgAN patients\ninto CD89 Tg mice triggers IgAN, and concomitant dysfunctional endocytosis and\nelimination of patient IgA, resulting in the deposition of CD89-IgA in kidneys\nof Tg mice. Our results indicate that although CD89 plays an important role\nin IgA and IgA-IC clearance, defective endocytosis of underglycosylated IgA is necessary\nfor the\ndevelopment of experimental IgAN.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Critical_role_of_Kupffer_cell_CD89_expression_in_experimental_IgA_nephropathy/3394930', [u'Nephrology and Urology'], []]

DUI evolved from maternal inheritance of Mitochondria and\nhas been proposed to be a resolved genomic conflict, triggered by\nselfish genes of putative viral origin, invading mtDNAs of some bivalve\nspecies, and switching ancestral hermaphroditism into gonochorism. Accordingly, mitochondria in DUI species were\nsuggested to affect the genetic cascade of germ line determination,\nand RNA interference was a reasonable candidate mechanism for this\nfeature. Actually, in small RNA libraries from enriched mitochondrial fractions\nof clam testes and ovaries, we found several small non coding RNAs (sncRNAs),\nproduced by either F- or M-mtDNAs. We therefore named them: small mitochondrial highly\ntranscribed RNAs (smithRNAs).', u'https://figshare.com/articles/SmithRNAs_could_mitochondria_bend_nuclear_regulation_/3398620', [u'Evolutionary Biology'], []]
