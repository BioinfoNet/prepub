[u'Rhythmic modulation of visual contrast discrimination triggered by action', ['Alessandro Benedetto', 'Donatella Spinelli', 'Concetta Morrone'], u'2016-04-23T13:45:34Z', u'Recent evidence suggests that ongoing brain oscillations may be instrumental in binding and integrating multisensory signals. In the present experiment, we investigated the temporal dynamics of visual-motor integration processes. We show that action modulates sensitivity to visual contrast discrimination in a rhythmic fashion at frequencies of about 5Hz (in the theta range), for up to one second after execution of action. To understand the origin of the oscillations, we measured oscillations in contrast sensitivity at different levels of luminance, which is known to affect the endogenous brain rhythms, boosting the power of alpha-frequencies. We found that the frequency of oscillation in sensitivity increased at low-luminance, likely reflecting the shift in mean endogenous brain rhythm towards higher frequencies. Importantly, both at high and at low luminance, contrast discrimination showed a rhythmic motor-induced suppression effect, with the suppression occurring earlier at low luminance. We suggest that oscillations play a key role in sensory-motor integration, and that the motor-induced suppression may reflect the first manifestation of a rhythmic oscillation.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Rhythmic_modulation_of_visual_contrast_discrimination_triggered_by_action/3144508', [u'Behavioral Neuroscience'], []]

Sanchez-Mercado', 'Cecilia Lozano', 'Liset Zambrano', 'Jose Alberto Soto Villalobos', 'Jessica Baettig', 'Patricia Ortega', 'Maria Leal'], u'2014-08-25T14:23:00Z', u'Since 1998 several projects and partnerships, such as GloBIS/GART and Taxome, and individual efforts from several academic or enthusiastic lepidopterologists, have attempted to compile available biological information on all butterfly families in web-plattforms. They provide detailed taxonomic and basic biological information, but most of them depend on the contributions of few experts and are either static or sporadically updated. Broad-scope platforms like Wikipedia and Encyclopedia of Life (EOL) have also assembled valuable information on taxonomy and systematics, conservation, ecology, and other useful topics. They tend to be more dynamic due to the contributions of several projects and enthusiastic users, and provide technical support and several web services and tools for interaction and editing, but have drawn less attention from experts, thus great amounts of information remain unvetted or show geographical and taxonomic bias of the contributors. We searched for 17398 species names in selected specialized and broad scope resources, and found more than 100000 BHL pages, 35000 EOL text data objects, 32000 wikipedia articles in 9 languages, 2094000 GBIF records, and 22000 hostplant records in HOSTS database. Wikipedia and Savelas\u2019 page have almost complete coverage of species, while EOL and BHL included around half of the species, GBIF 39% and HOSTS just 19.9 %. All sources, except HOSTS, include all subfamilies and similar proportion of species per subfamily. Papilionidae and Pieridae have better coverage and content quantity in BHL, Wikipedia and GBIF, but do not differ substantially from other families in EOL. Few species accumulate large content, while half of the species is either not included or has less than 10 pages, data objects or records.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/The_need_to_integrate_experts_web_based_tools_and_communities_to_create_a_truly_global_biological_information_system_for_butterflies/1150237', [u'Information Systems', u'Zoology'], []]

In response to evolving needs of the structural biology community, we established a diffraction data publication and dissemination system, Structural Biology Data Grid (SBDG, url: data.sbgrid.org), to preserve primary experimental datasets that support journal publications. Datasets archived with the SBDG are freely available to the research community under a public domain dedication license and the metadata for all datasets is published under the DataCite schema. Datasets are accessible to researchers through the Data Access Alliance infrastructure, which facilitates global and institutional data access. Our analysis of a pilot collection of crystallographic datasets demonstrates that the information archived by SBDG is sufficient to reprocess data to statistics that meet or exceed the quality of the original published structures. It is anticipated that access to the experimental datasets will enable paradigm shift in the community from the static archive towards a much more dynamic body of continuously improving refined models. Following the success of this pilot study, the SBDG has extended its services to the entire community and will be used to develop support for other types of biomedical datasets, such as MicroED, Molecular Dynamics trajectories and LaPice Light-Sheet Microscopy.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/SBGRid_DB_Poster_Force2016_pdf/3175417', [u'Structural Biology', u'Structural Biology (incl.
