[u'Drosophila Free-Running Rhythms Require Intercellular Communication', ['Ying Peng', 'Dan Stoleru', 'Joel D Levine', 'Jeffrey C Hall', 'Michael Rosbash'], u'2013-01-20T11:41:59Z', u'Robust self-sustained oscillations are a ubiquitous characteristic of circadian rhythms. These include Drosophila locomotor activity rhythms, which persist for weeks in constant darkness (DD). Yet the molecular oscillations that underlie circadian rhythms damp rapidly in many Drosophila tissues. Although much progress has been made in understanding the biochemical and cellular basis of circadian rhythms, the mechanisms that underlie the differences between damped and self-sustaining oscillations remain largely unknown. A small cluster of neurons in adult Drosophila brain, the ventral lateral neurons (LNvs), is essential for self-sustained behavioral rhythms and has been proposed to be the primary pacemaker for locomotor activity rhythms. With an LNv-specific driver, we restricted functional clocks to these neurons and showed that they are not sufficient to drive circadian locomotor activity rhythms. Also contrary to expectation, we found that all brain clock neurons manifest robust circadian oscillations of timeless and cryptochrome RNA for many days in DD. This persistent molecular rhythm requires pigment-dispersing factor (PDF), an LNv-specific neuropeptide, because the molecular oscillations are gradually lost when Pdf01 mutant flies are exposed to free-running conditions. This observation precisely parallels the previously reported effect on behavioral rhythms of the Pdf01 mutant. PDF is likely to affect some clock neurons directly, since the peptide appears to bind to the surface of many clock neurons, including the LNvs themselves. We showed that the brain circadian clock in Drosophila is clearly distinguishable from the eyes and other rapidly damping peripheral tissues, as it sustains robust molecular oscillations in DD. At the same time, different clock neurons are likely to work cooperatively within the brain, because the LNvs alone are insufficient to support the circadian program. Based on the damping results with Pdf01 mutant flies, we propose that LNvs, and specifically the PDF neuropeptide that it synthesizes, are important in coordinating a circadian cellular network within the brain. The cooperative function of this network appears to be necessary for maintaining robust molecular oscillations in DD and is the basis of sustained circadian locomotor activity rhythms.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/_Drosophila_Free_Running_Rhythms_Require_Intercellular_Communication/153390', [u'Genetics', u'Molecular Biology', u'Neuroscience', u'Evolutionary Biology', u'Developmental Biology', u'Cancer', u'Mental Health', u'Infectious Diseases', u'Plant Biology', u'Virology'], []]

They have the same chromosome number and genome sizes, and they occupy the same ecological niche. To explore the basis for this striking conservation of structure and function, we have sequenced the C. briggsae genome to a high-quality draft stage and compared it to the finished C. elegans sequence. We predict approximately 19,500 protein-coding genes in the C. briggsae genome, roughly the same as in C. elegans. Of these, 12,200 have clear C. elegans orthologs, a further 6,500 have one or more clearly detectable C. elegans homologs, and approximately 800 C. briggsae genes have no detectable matches in C. elegans. Almost all of the noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) known are shared between the two species. The two genomes exhibit extensive colinearity, and the rate of divergence appears to be higher in the chromosomal arms than in the centers. Operons, a distinctive feature of C. elegans, are highly conserved in C. briggsae, with the arrangement of genes being preserved in 96% of cases. The difference in size between the C. briggsae (estimated at approximately 104 Mbp) and C. elegans (100.3 Mbp) genomes is almost entirely due to repetitive sequence, which accounts for 22.4% of the C. briggsae genome in contrast to 16.5% of the C. elegans genome. Few, if any, repeat families are shared, suggesting that most were acquired after the two species diverged or are undergoing rapid evolution. Coclustering the C. elegans and C. briggsae proteins reveals 2,169 protein families of two or more members. Most of these are shared between the two species, but some appear to be expanding or contracting, and there seem to be as many as several hundred novel C. briggsae gene families. The C. briggsae draft sequence will greatly improve the annotation of the C. elegans genome. Based on similarity to C. briggsae, we found strong evidence for 1,300 new C. elegans genes. In addition, comparisons of the two genomes will help to understand the evolutionary forces that mold nematode genomes.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/The_Genome_Sequence_of_Caenorhabditis_briggsae_A_Platform_for_Comparative_Genomics/153402', [u'Biochemistry', u'Microbiology', u'Genetics', u'Molecular Biology', u'Biotechnology', u'Evolutionary Biology', u'Biological Sciences', u'Developmental Biology', u'Cancer', u'Statistics', u'Infectious Diseases', u'Plant Biology', u'Virology'], []]

KS-CLF is the condensing enzyme in the minimal PKS, catalyzing each round of condensation between malonyl-ACP and the growing polyketide chain. ACP serves as the carrier for malonyl units, and it is malonylated by the MAT associated with FAS. Chain synthesis initiates with the decarboxylation of malonyl-ACP to acetyl-ACP by the KS-CLF for most aromatic PKSs. The acetyl unit is then transferred to the KS-CLF and primes the enzyme for subsequent condensations. The overall chain length is controlled by the KS-CLF complex. An octaketide synthase (e.g., act PKS) uses a total of eight malonyl equivalents (including the primer), while a decaketide synthase (e.g., tcm PKS) uses a total of ten malonyl equivalents.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/_Biosynthesis_of_Acetate_Primed_Polyketides_/634711', [u'Biochemistry', u'Medicine', u'Genetics', u'Biotechnology', u'Sociology', u'Chemical Sciences', u'Biological Sciences', u'Infectious Diseases', u'Computational  Biology'], []]

Ketoreductase, dehydratase, and enoylreductase associated with FAS are presumed to transformed the \u03b2-ketoacyl-ZhuG moiety into alkylacyl-ZhuG. The alkylacyl-ZhuG is then able to prime the minimal PKS module (consisting of the ZhuB [KS], ZhuA [CLF], ACP [ZhuN], and MAT) and initiate polyketide synthesis. The mechanism by which the transacylation occurs is not known and is possibly catalyzed by unassigned, but essential, enzyme ZhuC.

Currently, our knowledge in this area is still limited. Several lines of investigation have been used to elucidate the structure and function of the genes in the human genome. Even so, gene prediction remains a difficult task, as the varieties of transcripts of a gene may vary to a great extent. We thus performed an exhaustive integrative characterization of 41,118 full-length cDNAs that capture the gene transcripts as complete functional cassettes, providing an unequivocal report of structural and functional diversity at the gene level. Our international collaboration has validated 21,037 human gene candidates by analysis of high-quality full-length cDNA clones through curation using unified criteria. This led to the identification of 5,155 new gene candidates. It also manifested the most reliable way to control the quality of the cDNA clones. We have developed a human gene database, called the H-Invitational Database (H-InvDB; http://www.h-invitational.jp/). It provides the following: integrative annotation of human genes, description of gene structures, details of novel alternative splicing isoforms, non-protein-coding RNAs, functional domains, subcellular localizations, metabolic pathways, predictions of protein three-dimensional structure, mapping of known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), identification of polymorphic microsatellite repeats within human genes, and comparative results with mouse full-length cDNAs. The H-InvDB analysis has shown that up to 4% of the human genome sequence (National Center for Biotechnology Information build 34 assembly) may contain misassembled or missing regions. We found that 6.5% of the human gene candidates (1,377 loci) did not have a good protein-coding open reading frame, of which 296 loci are strong candidates for non-protein-coding RNA genes. In addition, among 72,027 uniquely mapped SNPs and insertions/deletions localized within human genes, 13,215 nonsynonymous SNPs, 315 nonsense SNPs, and 452 indels occurred in coding regions. Together with 25 polymorphic microsatellite repeats present in coding regions, they may alter protein structure, causing phenotypic effects or resulting in disease. The H-InvDB platform represents a substantial contribution to resources needed for the exploration of human biology and pathology.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Integrative_Annotation_of_21_037_Human_Genes_Validated_by_Full_Length_cDNA_Clones/153364', [u'Genetics', u'Molecular Biology', u'Evolutionary Biology', u'Biological Sciences', u'Infectious Diseases'], []]

Our kinetic primer extension studies demonstrate that the bypass polymerase Dpo4 preferentially inserts C opposite oxoG, and also preferentially extends from the oxoG\u2022C base pair, thus achieving error-free bypass of this lesion. We have determined the crystal structures of preinsertion binary, insertion ternary, and postinsertion binary complexes of oxoG-modified template-primer DNA and Dpo4. These structures provide insights into the translocation mechanics of the bypass polymerase during a complete cycle of nucleotide incorporation. Specifically, during noncovalent dCTP insertion opposite oxoG (or G), the little-finger domain\u2013DNA phosphate contacts translocate by one nucleotide step, while the thumb domain\u2013DNA phosphate contacts remain fixed. By contrast, during the nucleotidyl transfer reaction that covalently incorporates C opposite oxoG, the thumb-domain\u2013phosphate contacts are translocated by one nucleotide step, while the little-finger contacts with phosphate groups remain fixed. These stepwise conformational transitions accompanying nucleoside triphosphate binding and covalent nucleobase incorporation during a full replication cycle of Dpo4-catalyzed bypass of the oxoG lesion are distinct from the translocation events in replicative polymerases.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Stepwise_Translocation_of_Dpo4_Polymerase_during_Error_Free_Bypass_of_an_oxoG_Lesion/153546', [u'Molecular Biology'], []]

Here we test if this angioarchitecture can ensure that the supply of blood is redistributed after vascular occlusion. We use rodent parietal cortex as a model system and image the flow of red blood cells in individual microvessels. Changes in flow are quantified in response to photothrombotic occlusions to individual pial arterioles as well as to physical occlusions of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), the primary source of blood to this network. We observe that perfusion is rapidly reestablished at the first branch downstream from a photothrombotic occlusion through a reversal in flow in one vessel. More distal downstream arterioles also show reversals in flow. Further, occlusion of the MCA leads to reversals in flow through approximately half of the downstream but distant arterioles. Thus the cortical arteriolar network supports collateral flow that may mitigate the effects of vessel obstruction, as may occur secondary to neurovascular pathology.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Two_Photon_Imaging_of_Cortical_Surface_Microvessels_Reveals_a_Robust_Redistribution_in_Blood_Flow_after_Vascular_Occlusion/153558', [u'Physiology', u'Neuroscience', u'Biophysics'], []]

Here we show that intronic hnRNP A/B\u2013binding sites (ABS) can stimulate the in vitro splicing of pre-mRNAs containing artificially enlarged introns. Stimulation of in vitro splicing could also be obtained by providing intronic ABS in trans through the use of antisense oligonucleotides containing a non-hybridizing ABS-carrying tail. ABS-tailed oligonucleotides also improved the in vivo inclusion of an alternative exon flanked by an enlarged intron. Notably, binding sites for hnRNP F/H proteins (FBS) replicate the activity of ABS by improving the splicing of an enlarged intron and by modulating 5\u2032 splice-site selection. One hypothesis formulated to explain these effects is that bound hnRNP proteins self-interact to bring in closer proximity the external pair of splice sites. Consistent with this model, positioning FBS or ABS at both ends of an intron was required to stimulate splicing of some pre-mRNAs. In addition, a computational analysis of the configuration of putative FBS and ABS located at the ends of introns supports the view that these motifs have evolved to support cooperative interactions. Our results document a positive role for the hnRNP A/B and hnRNP F/H proteins in generic splicing, and suggest that these proteins may modulate the conformation of mammalian pre-mRNAs.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Intronic_Binding_Sites_for_hnRNP_A_B_and_hnRNP_F_H_Proteins_Stimulate_Pre_mRNA_Splicing/153498', [u'Molecular Biology'], []]

This organism was susceptible to most antibiotics in the 1970s. It has now become a major cause of hospital-acquired infections worldwide due to its remarkable propensity to rapidly acquire resistance determinants to a wide range of antibacterial agents. Here we use a comparative genomic approach to identify the complete repertoire of resistance genes exhibited by the multidrug-resistant A. baumannii strain AYE, which is epidemic in France, as well as to investigate the mechanisms of their acquisition by comparison with the fully susceptible A. baumannii strain SDF, which is associated with human body lice. The assembly of the whole shotgun genome sequences of the strains AYE and SDF gave an estimated size of 3.9 and 3.2 Mb, respectively. A. baumannii strain AYE exhibits an 86-kb genomic region termed a resistance island\u2014the largest identified to date\u2014in which 45 resistance genes are clustered. At the homologous location, the SDF strain exhibits a 20 kb-genomic island flanked by transposases but devoid of resistance markers. Such a switching genomic structure might be a hotspot that could explain the rapid acquisition of resistance markers under antimicrobial pressure. Sequence similarity and phylogenetic analyses confirm that most of the resistance genes found in the A. baumannii strain AYE have been recently acquired from bacteria of the genera Pseudomonas, Salmonella, or Escherichia. This study also resulted in the discovery of 19 new putative resistance genes. Whole-genome sequencing appears to be a fast and efficient approach to the exhaustive identification of resistance genes in epidemic infectious agents of clinical significance.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Comparative_Genomics_of_Multidrug_Resistance_in_Acinetobacter_baumannii_/153038', [u'Genetics', u'Cancer', u'Microbiology'], []]

A comprehensive analysis of such patterns in prokaryotic sequences and genome-scale functional data has yet to be performed. We detected spatial patterns in sequence-derived parameters for 163 chromosomes occurring in 135 bacterial and 16 archaeal organisms using wavelet analysis. Pattern strength was found to correlate with organism-specific features such as genome size, overall GC content, and the occurrence of known motility and chromosomal binding proteins. Given additional functional data for Escherichia coli, we found significant correlations among chromosome position dependent patterns in numerous properties, some of which are consistent with previously experimentally identified chromosome macrodomains. These results demonstrate that the large-scale organization of most sequenced genomes is significantly nonrandom, and, moreover, that this organization is likely linked to genome size, nucleotide composition, and information transfer processes. Constraints on genome evolution and design are thus not solely dependent upon information content, but also upon an intricate multi-parameter, multi-length-scale organization of the chromosome.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Long_Range_Periodic_Patterns_in_Microbial_Genomes_Indicate_Significant_Multi_Scale_Chromosomal_Organization/153039', [u'Genetics', u'Biological Sciences', u'Medicine', u'Microbiology'], []]
[u'Genome-Wide Identification of Human Functional DNA Using a Neutral Indel Model', ['Gerton Lunter', 'Chris P Ponting', 'Jotun Hein'], u'2006-01-13T00:50:41Z', u"It has become clear that a large proportion of functional DNA in the human genome does not code for protein. Identification of this non-coding functional sequence using comparative approaches is proving difficult and has previously been thought to require deep sequencing of multiple vertebrates. Here we introduce a new model and comparative method that, instead of nucleotide substitutions, uses the evolutionary imprint of insertions and deletions (indels) to infer the past consequences of selection. The model predicts the distribution of indels under neutrality, and shows an excellent fit to human\u2013mouse ancestral repeat data. Across the genome, many unusually long ungapped regions are detected that are unaccounted for by the neutral model, and which we predict to be highly enriched in functional DNA that has been subject to purifying selection with respect to indels. We use the model to determine the proportion under indel-purifying selection to be between 2.56% and 3.25% of human euchromatin. Since annotated protein-coding genes comprise only 1.2% of euchromatin, these results lend further weight to the proposition that more than half the functional complement of the human genome is non-protein-coding. The method is surprisingly powerful at identifying selected sequence using only two or three mammalian genomes. Applying the method to the human, mouse, and dog genomes, we identify 90 Mb of human sequence under indel-purifying selection, at a predicted 10% false-discovery rate and 75% sensitivity. As expected, most of the identified sequence represents unannotated material, while the recovered proportions of known protein-coding and microRNA genes closely match the predicted sensitivity of the method. The method's high sensitivity to functional sequence such as microRNAs suggest that as yet unannotated microRNA genes are enriched among the sequences identified. Futhermore, its independence of substitutions allowed us to identify sequence that has been subject to heterogeneous selection, that is, sequence subject to both positive selection with respect to substitutions and purifying selection with respect to indels. The ability to identify elements under heterogeneous selection enables, for the first time, the genome-wide investigation of positive selection on functional elements other than protein-coding genes.", u'https://figshare.com/articles/Genome_Wide_Identification_of_Human_Functional_DNA_Using_a_Neutral_Indel_Model/153041', [u'Genetics', u'Biological Sciences', u'Evolutionary Biology'], []]

Moreover, whether a protein is membrane-bound, secreted, or intracellular affects the usefulness of, and the strategies for, using a protein as a diagnostic marker or a target for therapy. We employed a rapid and efficient experimental approach to classify thousands of human gene products as either \u201cmembrane-associated/secreted\u201d (MS) or \u201ccytosolic/nuclear\u201d (CN). Using subcellular fractionation methods, we separated mRNAs associated with membranes from those associated with the soluble cytosolic fraction and analyzed these two pools by comparative hybridization to DNA microarrays. Analysis of 11 different human cell lines, representing lymphoid, myeloid, breast, ovarian, hepatic, colon, and prostate tissues, identified more than 5,000 previously uncharacterized MS and more than 6,400 putative CN genes at high confidence levels. The experimentally determined localizations correlated well with in silico predictions of signal peptides and transmembrane domains, but also significantly increased the number of human genes that could be cataloged as encoding either MS or CN proteins. Using gene expression data from a variety of primary human malignancies and normal tissues, we rationally identified hundreds of MS gene products that are significantly overexpressed in tumors compared to normal tissues and thus represent candidates for serum diagnostic tests or monoclonal antibody-based therapies. Finally, we used the catalog of CN gene products to generate sets of candidate markers of organ-specific tissue injury. The large-scale annotation of subcellular localization reported here will serve as a reference database and will aid in the rational design of diagnostic tests and molecular therapies for diverse diseases.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Genome_Scale_Identification_of_Membrane_Associated_Human_mRNAs/153062', [u'Biological Sciences', u'Genetics', u'Cancer', u'Cell Biology'], []]

In intact islets, \u03b2-cells are coupled by gap junctions, which are proposed to synchronize electrical activity and Cai oscillations after exposure to stimulatory glucose (>7 mM). To determine the significance of this coupling in regulating insulin secretion, we examined islets and \u03b2-cells from transgenic mice that express zero functional KATP channels in approximately 70% of their \u03b2-cells, but normal KATP channel density in the remainder. We found that KATP channel activity from approximately 30% of the \u03b2-cells is sufficient to maintain strong glucose dependence of metabolism, Cai, membrane potential, and insulin secretion from intact islets, but that glucose dependence is lost in isolated transgenic cells. Further, inhibition of gap junctions caused loss of glucose sensitivity specifically in transgenic islets. These data demonstrate a critical role of gap junctional coupling of KATP channel activity in control of membrane potential across the islet. Control via coupling lessens the effects of cell\u2013cell variation and provides resistance to defects in excitability that would otherwise lead to a profound diabetic state, such as occurs in persistent neonatal diabetes mellitus.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Critical_Role_of_Gap_Junction_Coupled_K_ATP_Channel_Activity_for_Regulated_Insulin_Secretion/153528', [u'Chemistry', u'Biotechnology', u'Cell Biology', u'Physiology', u'Biophysics'], []]

To discover broad relationships between regulation of alternative splicing and sequence conservation, we applied a systems approach, using oligonucleotide microarrays designed to capture splicing information across the mouse genome. In a set of 22 adult tissues, we observe differential expression of RNA containing at least two alternative splice junctions for about 40% of the 6,216 alternative events we could detect. Statistical comparisons identify 171 cassette exons whose inclusion or skipping is different in brain relative to other tissues and another 28 exons whose splicing is different in muscle. A subset of these exons is associated with unusual blocks of intron sequence whose conservation in vertebrates rivals that of protein-coding exons. By focusing on sets of exons with similar regulatory patterns, we have identified new sequence motifs implicated in brain and muscle splicing regulation. Of note is a motif that is strikingly similar to the branchpoint consensus but is located downstream of the 5\u2032 splice site of exons included in muscle. Analysis of three paralogous membrane-associated guanylate kinase genes reveals that each contains a paralogous tissue-regulated exon with a similar tissue inclusion pattern. While the intron sequences flanking these exons remain highly conserved among mammalian orthologs, the paralogous flanking intron sequences have diverged considerably, suggesting unusually complex evolution of the regulation of alternative splicing in multigene families.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Unusual_Intron_Conservation_near_Tissue_Regulated_Exons_Found_by_Splicing_Microarrays/153037', [u'Biotechnology', u'Molecular Biology', u'Developmental Biology', u'Biological Sciences', u'Neuroscience', u'Medicine'], []]

PRRs commonly associate with or contain members of a monophyletic group of kinases called the interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) family that include Drosophila Pelle, human IRAKs, rice XA21 and Arabidopsis FLS2. In mammals, PRRs can also associate with members of the receptor-interacting protein (RIP) kinase family, distant relatives to the IRAK family. Some IRAK and RIP family kinases fall into a small functional class of kinases termed non-RD, many of which do not autophosphorylate the activation loop. We surveyed the yeast, fly, worm, human, Arabidopsis, and rice kinomes (3,723 kinases) and found that despite the small number of non-RD kinases in these genomes (9%\u201329%), 12 of 15 kinases known or predicted to function in PRR signaling fall into the non-RD class.

In addition to identifying coregulated genes, the genetic dimension also supplies us with information about the genomic locations of putative regulatory loci. We calculated correlations among approximately 45,000 expression traits derived from 60 individuals in an F2 sample segregating for obesity and diabetes. By combining the correlation results with linkage mapping information, we were able to identify regulatory networks, make functional predictions for uncharacterized genes, and characterize novel members of known pathways. We found evidence of coordinate regulation of 174 G protein\u2013coupled receptor protein signaling pathway expression traits. Of the 174 traits, 50 had their major LOD peak within 10 cM of a locus on Chromosome 2, and 81 others had a secondary peak in this region. We also characterized a Riken cDNA clone that showed strong correlation with stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 expression. Experimental validation confirmed that this clone is involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism. We conclude that trait correlation combined with linkage mapping can reveal regulatory networks that would otherwise be missed if we studied only mRNA traits with statistically significant linkages in this small cross.

Here we characterize a family of complexes (which we term leading edge complexes), scaffolded by hematopoietic protein 1 (Hem-1), that organize the neutrophil's leading edge. The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein family Verprolin-homologous protein (WAVE)2 complex, which mediates activation of actin polymerization by Rac, is only one member of this family.

We have found that loss of the SmpB-SsrA function causes acute defects in the ability of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis to survive in hostile environments. Most significantly, we show that mutations in smpB-ssrA genes render the bacterium avirulent and unable to cause mortality in mice. Consistent with these observations, we show that the mutant strain is unable to proliferate in macrophages and exhibits delayed Yop-mediated host cell cytotoxicity. Correspondingly, we demonstrate that the smpB-ssrA mutant suffers severe deficiencies in expression and secretion of Yersinia virulence effector proteins, and that this defect is at the level of transcription. Of further interest is the finding that the SmpB-SsrA system might play a similar role in the related type III secretion system that governs flagella assembly and bacterial motility.

Advancement in identification of MHC genes that confer susceptibility to disease requires greater knowledge of sequence variation across the complex. Highly duplicated and polymorphic regions of the human genome such as the MHC are, however, somewhat refractory to some whole-genome analysis methods. To address this issue, we are employing a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) cloning strategy to sequence entire MHC haplotypes from consanguineous cell lines as part of the MHC Haplotype Project. Here we present 4.25 Mb of the human haplotype QBL (HLA-A26-B18-Cw5-DR3-DQ2) and compare it with the MHC reference haplotype and with a second haplotype, COX (HLA-A1-B8-Cw7-DR3-DQ2), that shares the same HLA-DRB1, -DQA1, and -DQB1 alleles. We have defined the complete gene, splice variant, and sequence variation contents of all three haplotypes, comprising over 259 annotated loci and over 20,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Certain coding sequences vary significantly between different haplotypes, making them candidates for functional and disease-association studies. Analysis of the two DR3 haplotypes allowed delineation of the shared sequence between two HLA class II\u2013related haplotypes differing in disease associations and the identification of at least one of the sites that mediated the original recombination event. The levels of variation across the MHC were similar to those seen for other HLA-disparate haplotypes, except for a 158-kb segment that contained the HLA-DRB1, -DQA1, and -DQB1 genes and showed very limited polymorphism compatible with identity-by-descent and relatively recent common ancestry (<3,400 generations). These results indicate that the differential disease associations of these two DR3 haplotypes are due to sequence variation outside this central 158-kb segment, and that shuffling of ancestral blocks via recombination is a potential mechanism whereby certain DR\u2013DQ allelic combinations, which presumably have favoured immunological functions, can spread across haplotypes and populations.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Genetic_Analysis_of_Completely_Sequenced_Disease_Associated_MHC_Haplotypes_Identifies_Shuffling_of_Segments_in_Recent_Human_History/153036', [u'Chemistry', u'Immunology', u'Genetics', u'Evolutionary Biology'], []]

It is important but challenging to determine the binding specificity of these domains accurately and to predict their physiological interacting partners. In this study, the interactions between 35 peptide ligands (15 binders and 20 non-binders) and the Abl SH3 domain were analyzed using molecular dynamics simulation and the Molecular Mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann Solvent Area method. The calculated binding free energies correlated well with the rank order of the binding peptides and clearly distinguished binders from non-binders. Free energy component analysis revealed that the van der Waals interactions dictate the binding strength of peptides, whereas the binding specificity is determined by the electrostatic interaction and the polar contribution of desolvation. The binding motif of the Abl SH3 domain was then determined by a virtual mutagenesis method, which mutates the residue at each position of the template peptide relative to all other 19 amino acids and calculates the binding free energy difference between the template and the mutated peptides using the Molecular Mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann Solvent Area method. A single position mutation free energy profile was thus established and used as a scoring matrix to search peptides recognized by the Abl SH3 domain in the human genome. Our approach successfully picked ten out of 13 experimentally determined binding partners of the Abl SH3 domain among the top 600 candidates from the 218,540 decapeptides with the PXXP motif in the SWISS-PROT database.

This process depends on the interaction between the bacterial surface protein Internalin A and the host protein E-cadherin, located below the epithelial tight junctions at the lateral cell-to-cell contacts. We used polarized MDCK cells as a model epithelium to determine how L. monocytogenes breaches the tight junctions to gain access to this basolateral receptor protein. We determined that L. monocytogenes does not actively disrupt the tight junctions, but finds E-cadherin at a morphologically distinct subset of intercellular junctions. We identified these sites as naturally occurring regions where single senescent cells are expelled and detached from the epithelium by extrusion. The surrounding cells reorganize to form a multicellular junction that maintains epithelial continuity. We found that E-cadherin is transiently exposed to the lumenal surface at multicellular junctions during and after cell extrusion, and that L. monocytogenes takes advantage of junctional remodeling to adhere to and subsequently invade the epithelium. In intact epithelial monolayers, an anti-E-cadherin antibody specifically decorates multicellular junctions and blocks L. monocytogenes adhesion. Furthermore, an L. monocytogenes mutant in the Internalin A gene is completely deficient in attachment to the epithelial apical surface and is unable to invade. We hypothesized that L. monocytogenes utilizes analogous extrusion sites for epithelial invasion in vivo. By infecting rabbit ileal loops, we found that the junctions at the cell extrusion zone of villus tips are the specific target for L. monocytogenes adhesion and invasion. Thus, L. monocytogenes exploits the dynamic nature of epithelial renewal and junctional remodeling to breach the intestinal barrier.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/_Listeria_monocytogenes_Invades_the_Epithelial_Junctions_at_Sites_of_Cell_Extrusion/153060', [u'Microbiology', u'Cancer', u'Chemistry', u'Cell Biology', u'Medicine'], []]

For example, it has been known for almost 90 y that clinical isolates of the human bacterial pathogen group A streptococci (GAS) have extensive phenotypic heterogeneity linked to variation in virulence. However, the complete underlying molecular mechanism(s) have not been defined. Expression microarray analysis of nine clinical isolates identified two fundamentally different transcriptomes, designated pharyngeal transcriptome profile (PTP) and invasive transcriptome profile (ITP). PTP and ITP GAS differed in approximately 10% of the transcriptome, including at least 23 proven or putative virulence factor genes. ITP organisms were recovered from skin lesions of mice infected subcutaneously with PTP GAS and were significantly more able to survive phagocytosis and killing by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.

Thus far, only RNA polymerase III (Pol III)\u2013expressed short hairpin RNA (shRNA) has been used to make shRNA-expressing transgenic mice. However, widespread knockdown and induction of phenotypes of gene knockout in postnatal mice have not been demonstrated. Previous studies have shown that Pol II synthesizes micro RNAs (miRNAs)\u2014the endogenous shRNAs that carry out gene silencing function. To achieve efficient gene knockdown in mammals and to generate phenotypes of gene knockout, we designed a construct in which a Pol II (ubiquitin C) promoter drove the expression of an shRNA with a structure that mimics human miRNA miR-30a. Two transgenic lines showed widespread and sustained shRNA expression, and efficient knockdown of the target gene Sod2. These mice were viable but with phenotypes of SOD2 deficiency. Bigenic heterozygous mice generated by crossing these two lines showed nearly undetectable target gene expression and phenotypes consistent with the target gene knockout, including slow growth, fatty liver, dilated cardiomyopathy, and premature death. This approach opens the door of RNAi to a wide array of well-established Pol II transgenic strategies and offers a technically simpler, cheaper, and quicker alternative to gene knockout by homologous recombination for reverse genetics in mice and other mammalian species.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Pol_II_Expressed_shRNA_Knocks_Down_Sod2_Gene_Expression_and_Causes_Phenotypes_of_the_Gene_Knockout_in_Mice/153110', [u'Genetics', u'Biotechnology'], []]

Vultures are exposed to diclofenac when scavenging on livestock treated with the drug shortly before death. Diclofenac causes kidney damage, increased serum uric acid concentrations, visceral gout, and death. Concern about this issue led the Indian Government to announce its intention to ban the veterinary use of diclofenac by September 2005. Implementation of a ban is still in progress late in 2005, and to facilitate this we sought potential alternative NSAIDs by obtaining information from captive bird collections worldwide. We found that the NSAID meloxicam had been administered to 35 captiveGyps vultures with no apparent ill effects. We then undertook a phased programme of safety testing of meloxicam on the African white-backed vultureGyps africanus, which we had previously established to be as susceptible to diclofenac poisoning as the endangered AsianGyps vultures. We estimated the likely maximum level of exposure (MLE) of wild vultures and dosed birds by gavage (oral administration) with increasing quantities of the drug until the likely MLE was exceeded in a sample of 40G. africanus. Subsequently, sixG. africanus were fed tissues from cattle which had been treated with a higher than standard veterinary course of meloxicam prior to death. In the final phase, ten Asian vultures of two of the endangered species(Gyps bengalensis,Gyps indicus) were dosed with meloxicam by gavage; five of them at more than the likely MLE dosage. All meloxicam-treated birds survived all treatments, and none suffered any obvious clinical effects. Serum uric acid concentrations remained within the normal limits throughout, and were significantly lower than those from birds treated with diclofenac in other studies. We conclude that meloxicam is of low toxicity toGyps vultures and that its use in place of diclofenac would reduce vulture mortality substantially in the Indian subcontinent.

Visualization of the DCC, a large ribonucleoprotein complex, on male larval polytene chromosomes reveals that the complex binds selectively to many interbands on the X chromosome. The targeting of the DCC is thought to be in part determined by DNA sequences that are enriched on the X. So far, lack of knowledge about DCC binding sites has prevented the identification of sequence determinants. Only three binding sites have been identified to date, but analysis of their DNA sequence did not allow the prediction of further binding sites. We have used chromatin immunoprecipitation to identify a number of new DCC binding fragments and characterized them in vivo by visualizing DCC binding to autosomal insertions of these fragments, and we have demonstrated that they possess a wide range of potential to recruit the DCC. By varying the in vivo concentration of the DCC, we provide evidence that this range of recruitment potential is due to differences in affinity of the complex to these sites. We were also able to establish that DCC binding to ectopic high-affinity sites can allow nearby low-affinity sites to recruit the complex. Using the sequences of the newly identified and previously characterized binding fragments, we have uncovered a number of short sequence motifs, which in combination may contribute to DCC recruitment. Our findings suggest that the DCC is recruited to the X via a number of binding sites of decreasing affinities, and that the presence of high- and moderate-affinity sites on the X may ensure that lower-affinity sites are occupied in a context-dependent manner. Our bioinformatics analysis suggests that DCC binding sites may be composed of variable combinations of degenerate motifs.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Targeting_Determinants_of_Dosage_Compensation_in_Drosophila_/153018', [u'Genetics'], []]

To analyze such quantitative traits, one must first map the underlying quantitative trait loci.

In this work, we analyzed three Saccharomyces cerevisiae high-temperature growth (Htg) QTGs (MKT1, END3, and RHO2). We observed a high level of genetic interactions among QTGs and strain background. Interestingly, while the MKT1 and END3 coding polymorphisms contribute to phenotype, it is the RHO2 3\u2032UTR polymorphisms that are phenotypically relevant. Reciprocal hemizygosity analysis of the Htg QTGs in hybrids between S288c and ten unrelated S. cerevisiae strains reveals that the contributions of the Htg QTGs are not conserved in nine other hybrids, which has implications for QTG identification by marker-trait association.

Theodor Boveri hypothesized nearly 100 years ago that aneuploidy was due to an increase in centrosome number (multipolar mitoses) and the resultant abnormal segregation of chromosomes. We performed immunocytochemistry, quantitative immunofluorescence, karyotypic analysis, and time-lapse microscopy on primary human diploid epithelial cells and fibroblasts to better understand the mechanism involved in the production of supernumerary centrosomes (more than two microtubule nucleating bodies) to directly demonstrate that the presence of supernumerary centrosomes in genomically intact cells generates aneuploid daughter cells. We show that loss of p16INK4a generates supernumerary centrosomes through centriole pair splitting. Generation of supernumerary centrosomes in human diploid epithelial cells was shown to nucleate multipolar spindles and directly drive production of aneuploid daughter cells as a result of unequal segregation of the genomic material during mitosis. Finally, we demonstrate that p16INK4a cooperates with p21 through regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase activity to prevent centriole pair splitting. Cells with loss of p16INK4a activity have been found in vivo in histologically normal mammary tissue from a substantial fraction of healthy, disease-free women. Demonstration of centrosome dysfunction in cells due to loss of p16INK4a suggests that, under the appropriate conditions, these cells can become aneuploid.

However, there has been no comprehensive analysis of human-specific pseudogenes. Furthermore, it is unclear whether pseudogenization itself can be selectively favored and thus play an active role in human evolution. Here we conduct a comparative genomic analysis and a literature survey to identify 80 nonprocessed pseudogenes that were inactivated in the human lineage after its separation from the chimpanzee lineage. Many functions are involved among these genes, with chemoreception and immune response being outstandingly overrepresented, suggesting potential species-specific features in these aspects of human physiology. To explore the possibility of adaptive pseudogenization, we focus on CASPASE12, a cysteinyl aspartate proteinase participating in inflammatory and innate immune response to endotoxins. We provide population genetic evidence that the nearly complete fixation of a null allele at CASPASE12 has been driven by positive selection, probably because the null allele confers protection from severe sepsis. We estimate that the selective advantage of the null allele is about 0.9% and the pseudogenization started shortly before the out-of-Africa migration of modern humans. Interestingly, two other genes related to sepsis were also pseudogenized in humans, possibly by selection. These adaptive gene losses might have occurred because of changes in our environment or genetic background that altered the threat from or response to sepsis. The identification and analysis of human-specific pseudogenes open the door for understanding the roles of gene losses in human origins, and the demonstration that gene loss itself can be adaptive supports and extends the \u201cless-is-more\u201d hypothesis.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Gene_Losses_during_Human_Origins/153519', [u'Biological Sciences', u'Genetics', u'Evolutionary Biology'], []]

Andrew McCammon'], u'2006-02-17T00:50:10Z', u'The assembly of the ribosome has recently become an interesting target for antibiotics in several bacteria. In this work, we extended an analytical procedure to determine native state fluctuations and contact breaking to investigate the protein stability dependence in the 30S small ribosomal subunit of Thermus thermophilus. We determined the causal influence of the presence and absence of proteins in the 30S complex on the binding free energies of other proteins. The predicted dependencies are in overall agreement with the experimentally determined assembly map for another organism, Escherichia coli. We found that the causal influences result from two distinct mechanisms: one is pure internal energy change, the other originates from the entropy change. We discuss the implications on how to target the ribosomal assembly most effectively by suggesting six proteins as targets for mutations or other hindering of their binding. Our results show that by blocking one out of this set of proteins, the association of other proteins is eventually reduced, thus reducing the translation efficiency even more. We could additionally determine the binding dependency of THX\u2014a peptide not present in the ribosome of E. coli\u2014and suggest its assembly path.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Dependency_Map_of_Proteins_in_the_Small_Ribosomal_Subunit/153010', [u'Biochemistry', u'Molecular Biology', u'Biological Sciences', u'Microbiology'], []]

Here, we use an integrated genetic, genomic, and computational strategy to comprehensively determine the molecular identities of distinct myoblast subpopulations within the Drosophila embryonic mesoderm at the time that cell fates are initially specified. A compendium of gene expression profiles was generated for primary mesodermal cells purified by flow cytometry from appropriately staged wild-type embryos and from 12 genotypes in which myogenesis was selectively and predictably perturbed. A statistical meta-analysis of these pooled datasets\u2014based on expected trends in gene expression and on the relative contribution of each genotype to the detection of known muscle genes\u2014provisionally assigned hundreds of differentially expressed genes to particular myoblast subtypes. Whole embryo in situ hybridizations were then used to validate the majority of these predictions, thereby enabling true-positive detection rates to be estimated for the microarray data. This combined analysis reveals that myoblasts exhibit much greater gene expression heterogeneity and overall complexity than was previously appreciated. Moreover, it implicates the involvement of large numbers of uncharacterized, differentially expressed genes in myogenic specification and subsequent morphogenesis. These findings also underscore a requirement for considerable regulatory specificity for generating diverse myoblast identities. Finally, to illustrate how the developmental functions of newly identified myoblast genes can be efficiently surveyed, a rapid RNA interference assay that can be scored in living embryos was developed and applied to selected genes. This integrated strategy for examining embryonic gene expression and function provides a substantially expanded framework for further studies of this model developmental system.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/An_Integrated_Strategy_for_Analyzing_the_Unique_Developmental_Programs_of_Different_Myoblast_Subtypes/153049', [u'Biological Sciences', u'Genetics', u'Developmental Biology', u'Molecular Biology', u'Cell Biology', u'Medicine'], []]

Study of the functional role of chemical signaling within phytoplankton assemblages is still in its infancy although recent reports in diatoms suggest the existence of chemical-based defense strategies. Here, we demonstrate how the accurate perception of diatom-derived reactive aldehydes can determine cell fate in diatoms. In particular, the aldehyde (2E,4E/Z)-decadienal (DD) can trigger intracellular calcium transients and the generation of nitric oxide (NO) by a calcium-dependent NO synthase-like activity, which results in cell death. However, pretreatment of cells with sublethal doses of aldehyde can induce resistance to subsequent lethal doses, which is reflected in an altered calcium signature and kinetics of NO production. We also present evidence for a DD\u2013derived NO-based intercellular signaling system for the perception of stressed bystander cells. Based on these findings, we propose the existence of a sophisticated stress surveillance system in diatoms, which has important implications for understanding the cellular mechanisms responsible for acclimation versus death during phytoplankton bloom successions.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/A_Stress_Surveillance_System_Based_on_Calcium_and_Nitric_Oxide_in_Marine_Diatoms/153508', [u'Microbiology', u'Ecology', u'Evolutionary Biology', u'Cell Biology'], []]

We investigate whether Sankoff and Trinh indeed revealed a flaw in the arguments of Pevzner and Tesler. We show that Sankoff and Trinh's synteny block identification algorithm makes erroneous identifications even in small toy examples and that their parameters do not reflect the realities of the comparative genomic architecture of human and mouse. We further argue that if Sankoff and Trinh had fixed these problems, their arguments in support of the random breakage model would disappear. Finally, we study the link between rearrangements and regulatory regions and argue that long regulatory regions and inhomogeneity of gene distribution in mammalian genomes may be responsible for the breakpoint reuse phenomenon.", u'https://figshare.com/articles/The_Fragile_Breakage_versus_Random_Breakage_Models_of_Chromosome_Evolution/153008', [u'Biological Sciences', u'Mathematics', u'Evolutionary Biology'], []]

A high-complexity transposon-mutagenized library was used to infect mice intraperitoneally, and the selective disappearance of mutants was monitored after 7, 14, 21, and 28 d postinfection. One hundred and eighteen genes were identified to contribute to serovar Typhimurium infection of the spleens of mice by 28 d postinfection. The negatively selected mutants represent many known aspects of Salmonella physiology and pathogenesis, although the majority of the identified genes are of putative or unknown function. Approximately 30% of the negatively selected genes correspond to horizontally acquired regions such as those within Salmonella pathogenicity islands (SPI 1\u20135), prophages (Gifsy-1 and \u22122 and remnant), and the pSLT virulence plasmid. In addition, mutations in genes responsible for outer membrane structure and remodeling, such as LPS- and PhoP-regulated and fimbrial genes, were also selected against. Competitive index experiments demonstrated that the secreted SPI2 effectors SseK2 and SseJ as well as the SPI4 locus are attenuated relative to wild-type bacteria during systemic infection. Interestingly, several SPI1-encoded type III secretion system effectors/translocases are required by serovar Typhimurium to establish and, unexpectedly, to persist systemically, challenging the present description of Salmonella pathogenesis. Moreover, we observed a progressive selection against serovar Typhimurium mutants based upon the duration of the infection, suggesting that different classes of genes may be required at distinct stages of infection. Overall, these data indicate that Salmonella long-term systemic infection in the mouse requires a diverse repertoire of virulence factors. This diversity of genes presumably reflects the fact that bacteria sequentially encounter a variety of host environments and that Salmonella has evolved to respond to these selective forces in a way that permits both the bacteria and the host to survive.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Genome_Wide_Screen_for_Salmonella_Genes_Required_for_Long_Term_Systemic_Infection_of_the_Mouse/153012', [u'Cancer', u'Microbiology'], []]

Are proteins encoded by stable or unstable nucleotide sequences? If selection for variability is prevalent, one could expect an excess of unstable sequences. Alternatively, if selection against targets for errors were substantial, an excess of stable sequences would be expected. We screened the genome sequences of different organisms for an important determinant of stability, the presence of mononucleotide repeats. We find that codons are used to encode proteins in a way that avoids the emergence of mononucleotide repeats, and we can attribute this bias to selection rather than a neutral process. This indicates that selection for stability, rather than for the generation of variation, substantially influences how information is encoded in the genome.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/DNA_Sequences_Shaped_by_Selection_for_Stability/153013', [u'Genetics', u'Microbiology', u'Biological Sciences', u'Evolutionary Biology'], []]

Using an RNA-interference approach, we addressed the function of two PGRPs with amidase activity in the Drosophila immune response.

We previously demonstrated that theSCA7 gene product, ataxin-7 (ATXN7), is a subunit of the GCN5 histone acetyltransferase\u2013containing coactivator complexes TFTC/STAGA. We show here that TFTC/STAGA complexes purified from SCA7 mice have normal TRRAP, GCN5, TAF12, and SPT3 levels and that their histone or nucleosomal acetylation activities are unaffected.

In conclusion, we describe here a set of events accounting for SCA7 pathogenesis in the retina, in which polyQ-expanded ATXN7 deregulated TFTC/STAGA recruitment to a subset of genes specifically expressed in rod photoreceptors, leading to chromatin alterations and consequent progressive loss of rod photoreceptor function.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Glutamine_Expanded_Ataxin_7_Alters_TFTC_STAGA_Recruitment_and_Chromatin_Structure_Leading_to_Photoreceptor_Dysfunction/153592', [u'Biochemistry', u'Neuroscience', u'Genetics'], []]

Despite much research, the evolution of spliceosomal introns remains poorly understood. In this paper, we tried to gain insights into intron evolution from a novel perspective by comparing the gene structures of cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins (CRPs) and mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPs), which are held to be of archaeal and bacterial origin, respectively. We analyzed 25 homologous pairs of CRP and MRP genes that together had a total of 527 intron positions. We found that all 12 of the intron positions shared by CRP and MRP genes resulted from parallel intron gains and none could be considered to be \u201cconserved,\u201d i.e., descendants of the same ancestor. This was supported further by the high frequency of proto-splice sites at these shared positions; proto-splice sites are proposed to be sites for intron insertion. Although we could not definitively disprove that spliceosomal introns were already present in the last universal common ancestor, our results lend more support to the idea that introns were gained late. At least, our results show that MRP genes were intronless at the time of endosymbiosis. The parallel intron gains between CRP and MRP genes accounted for 2.3% of total intron positions, which should provide a reliable estimate for future inferences of intron evolution.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Analysis_of_Ribosomal_Protein_Gene_Structures_Implications_for_Intron_Evolution_/153002', [u'Genetics', u'Biological Sciences', u'Evolutionary Biology'], []]

Mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection induces significant remodeling of splenic microarchitecture, including loss of marginal zone macrophage populations and dissolution of T and B cell compartmentalization. MCMV preferentially infected the splenic stroma, targeting endothelial cells (EC) as revealed using MCMV-expressing green fluorescent protein. MCMV infection caused a specific, but transient transcriptional suppression of secondary lymphoid chemokine (CCL21). The loss of CCL21 was associated with the failure of T lymphocytes to locate within the T cell zone, although trafficking to the spleen was unaltered. Expression of CCL21 in lymphotoxin (LT)-\u03b1\u2013deficient mice is dramatically reduced, however MCMV infection further reduced CCL21 levels, suggesting that viral modulation of CCL21 was independent of LT\u03b1 signaling. Activation of LT\u03b2-receptor signaling with an agonistic antibody partially restored CCL21 mRNA expression and redirected transferred T cells to the splenic T cell zone in MCMV-infected mice. These results indicate that virus-induced alterations in lymphoid tissues can occur through an LT-independent modulation of chemokine transcription, and targeting of the LT cytokine system can counteract lymphoid tissue remodeling by MCMV.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Specific_Remodeling_of_Splenic_Architecture_by_Cytomegalovirus/153004', [u'Cancer', u'Immunology'], []]

The majority of CpG islands is normally unmethylated, but a sizeable fraction is prone to become methylated in various cell types and pathological situations. The goal of this study is to show that a computational epigenetics approach can discriminate between CpG islands that are prone to methylation from those that remain unmethylated. We develop a bioinformatics scoring and prediction method on the basis of a set of 1,184 DNA attributes, which refer to sequence, repeats, predicted structure, CpG islands, genes, predicted binding sites, conservation, and single nucleotide polymorphisms. These attributes are scored on 132 CpG islands across the entire human Chromosome 21, whose methylation status was previously established for normal human lymphocytes. Our results show that three groups of DNA attributes, namely certain sequence patterns, specific DNA repeats, and a particular DNA structure, are each highly correlated with CpG island methylation (correlation coefficients of 0.64, 0.66, and 0.49, respectively). We predicted, and subsequently experimentally examined 12 CpG islands from human Chromosome 21 with unknown methylation patterns and found more than 90% of our predictions to be correct. In addition, we applied our prediction method to analyzing Human Epigenome Project methylation data on human Chromosome 6 and again observed high prediction accuracy. In summary, our results suggest that DNA composition of CpG islands (sequence, repeats, and structure) plays a significant role in predisposing CpG islands for DNA methylation. This finding may have a strong impact on our understanding of changes in CpG island methylation in development and disease.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/CpG_Island_Methylation_in_Human_Lymphocytes_Is_Highly_Correlated_with_DNA_Sequence_Repeats_and_Predicted_DNA_Structure_/153044', [u'Genetics', u'Biological Sciences'], []]

Gain-of-function experiments show that the premature overexpression of IAN1 kills immature thymocytes, whereas short hairpin RNA-mediated loss-of-function studies show that IAN4 supports positive selection. The knockdown of IAN5 perturbs the optimal generation of CD4/CD8 double-positive thymocytes and reduces the survival of mature T lymphocytes. We also show evidence suggesting that IAN4 and IAN5 are associated with anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, whereas IAN1 is associated with pro-apoptotic Bax. Thus, the IAN family is a novel family of T cell\u2013receptor-responsive proteins that critically regulate thymic development and survival of T lymphocytes and that potentially exert regulatory functions through the association with Bcl-2 family proteins.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/IAN_Family_Critically_Regulates_Survival_and_Development_of_T_Lymphocytes/153464', [u'Immunology'], []]

[u'A New Description of Cellular Quiescence', ['Hilary A Coller', 'Liyun Sang', 'James M Roberts'], u'2006-03-07T00:58:34Z', u'Cellular quiescence, defined as reversible growth/proliferation arrest, is thought to represent a homogenous state induced by diverse anti-mitogenic signals. We used transcriptional profiling to characterize human diploid fibroblasts that exited the cell cycle after exposure to three independent signals\u2014mitogen withdrawal, contact inhibition, and loss of adhesion. We show here that each signal caused regulation of a unique set of genes known to be important for cessation of growth and division. Therefore, contrary to expectation, cells enter different quiescent states that are determined by the initiating signal. However, underlying this diversity we discovered a set of genes whose specific expression in non-dividing cells was signal-independent, and therefore representative of quiescence per se, rather than the signal that induced it. This fibroblast \u201cquiescence program\u201d contained genes that enforced the non-dividing state, and ensured the reversibility of the cell cycle arrest. We further demonstrate that one mechanism by which the reversibility of quiescence is insured is the suppression of terminal differentiation. Expression of the quiescence program was not simply a downstream consequence of exit from the cell cycle, because key parts, including those involved in suppressing differentiation, were not recapitulated during the cell cycle arrest caused by direct inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases. These studies form a basis for understanding the normal biology of cellular quiescence.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/A_New_Description_of_Cellular_Quiescence/153514', [u'Cell Biology'], []]

Contrary to some earlier low resolution studies that suggested a paucity of recent selection in sub-Saharan Africans, we find that by some measures our strongest signals of selection are from the Yoruba population. Finally, since these signals indicate the existence of genetic variants that have substantially different fitnesses, they must indicate loci that are the source of significant phenotypic variation. Though the relevant phenotypes are generally not known, such loci should be of particular interest in mapping studies of complex traits.

We have applied three alternative algorithmic approaches to identify circadian oscillation in time series expression profiles. Analyses of our own data indicate that the expression of at least 7% to 21% of active genes in mouse liver, and in white and brown adipose tissues follow a daily oscillatory pattern. Indeed, analysis of data from other laboratories suggests that the percentage of genes with an oscillatory pattern may approach 50% in the liver. For the rest of the genes, oscillation appears to be obscured by stochastic noise. Our phase classification and computer simulation studies based on multiple datasets indicate no detectable boundary between oscillating and non-oscillating fractions of genes.

We show that the rates of macro- and microrearrangements of gene order are correlated within individual lineages but are highly variable across different lineages. The most unstable genomes correspond to the pathogenic yeasts Candida albicans and Candida glabrata. Chromosomal maps have been intensively shuffled by numerous interchromosomal rearrangements, even between species that have retained a very high physical fraction of their genomes within small synteny blocks. Despite this intensive reshuffling of gene positions, essential genes, which cluster in low recombination regions in the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, tend to remain syntenic during evolution.

Initial hierarchical divisions based on morphology contained many misgroupings due to features that evolved independently by similar selection processes. Molecular analyses corrected many of these misgroupings and the superordinal hierarchy of placental mammals was recently assembled into four clades. However, long or rapid evolutionary periods, as well as directional mutation pressure, can produce molecular homoplasies, similar characteristics lacking common ancestors. Retroposed elements, by contrast, integrate randomly into genomes with negligible probabilities of the same element integrating independently into orthologous positions in different species. Thus, presence/absence analyses of these elements are a superior strategy for molecular systematics. By computationally scanning more than 160,000 chromosomal loci and judiciously selecting from only phylogenetically informative retroposons for experimental high-throughput PCR applications, we recovered 28 clear, independent monophyly markers that conclusively verify the earliest divergences in placental mammalian evolution. Using tests that take into account ancestral polymorphisms, multiple long interspersed elements and long terminal repeat element insertions provide highly significant evidence for the monophyletic clades Boreotheria (synonymous with Boreoeutheria), Supraprimates (synonymous with Euarchontoglires), and Laurasiatheria. More importantly, two retropositions provide new support for a prior scenario of early mammalian evolution that places the basal placental divergence between Xenarthra and Epitheria, the latter comprising all remaining placentals. Due to its virtually homoplasy-free nature, the analysis of retroposon presence/absence patterns avoids the pitfalls of other molecular methodologies and provides a rapid, unequivocal means for revealing the evolutionary history of organisms.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Retroposed_Elements_as_Archives_for_the_Evolutionary_History_of_Placental_Mammals/153480', [u'Biological Sciences', u'Genetics', u'Evolutionary Biology'], []]

Restriction of bacterial growth requires caspase-1 and the leucine-rich repeat-containing protein Naip5 (Birc1e). We identified mutants of L. pneumophila that evade macrophage innate immunity. All mutants were deficient in expression of flagellin, the primary flagellar subunit, and failed to induce caspase-1-mediated macrophage death. Interestingly, a previously isolated flagellar mutant (fliI) that expresses, but does not assemble, flagellin did not replicate in macrophages, and induced macrophage death. Thus, flagellin itself, not flagella or motility, is required to initiate macrophage innate immunity. Immunity to Legionella did not require MyD88, an essential adaptor for toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) signaling. Moreover, flagellin of Legionella and Salmonella induced cytotoxicity when delivered to the macrophage cytosol using Escherichia coli as a heterologous host. It thus appears that macrophages sense cytosolic flagellin via a TLR5-independent pathway that leads to rapid caspase-1-dependent cell death and provides defense against intracellular bacterial pathogens.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Flagellin_Deficient_Legionella_Mutants_Evade_Caspase_1_and_Naip5_Mediated_Macrophage_Immunity/152988', [u'Cancer', u'Microbiology', u'Immunology'], []]

We present a third orthogonal approach to gene prediction, based on detecting the genomic signatures of transcription, accumulated over evolutionary time. We discuss four algorithms based on this third concept: Greens and CHOWDER, which quantify mutational strand biases caused by transcription-coupled DNA repair, and ROAST and PASTA, which are based on strand-specific selection against polyadenylation signals. We combined these algorithms into an integrated method called FEAST, which we used to predict the location and orientation of thousands of putative transcription units not overlapping known genes. Many of the newly predicted transcriptional units do not appear to code for proteins. The new algorithms are particularly apt at detecting genes with long introns and lacking sequence conservation.

We used a two-tiered approach to identify naturally occurring epigenetic alleles in the flowering plant Arabidopsis: a primary screen for transcript level polymorphisms among three strains (Col, Cvi, Ler), followed by a secondary screen for epigenetic alleles. Here, we describe the identification of stable, meiotically transmissible epigenetic alleles that correspond to one member of a previously uncharacterized non-LTR retroposon family, which we have designated Sadhu. The pericentromeric At2g10410 element is highly expressed in strain Col, but silenced in Ler and 18 other strains surveyed. Transcription of this locus is inversely correlated with cytosine methylation and both the expression and DNA methylation states map in a Mendelian manner to stable cis-acting variation. The silent Ler allele can be converted by the epigenetic modifier mutation ddm1 to a meiotically stable expressing allele with an identical primary nucleotide sequence, demonstrating that the variation responsible for transcript level polymorphism among Arabidopsis strains is epigenetic. We extended our characterization of the Sadhu family members and show that different elements are subject to both genetic and epigenetic variation in natural populations.

The response to cell wall damage is well understood from studies in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where numerous cell wall integrity (CWI) genes are activated by transcription factor ScRlm1. Prior evidence suggests the hypothesis that both response and regulation may be conserved in the major fungal pathogen Candida albicans. We have tested this hypothesis by using a new C. albicans genetic resource: we have screened mutants defective in putative transcription factor genes for sensitivity to the cell wall biosynthesis inhibitor caspofungin. We find that the zinc finger protein CaCas5, which lacks a unique ortholog in S. cerevisiae, governs expression of many CWI genes. CaRlm1 has a modest role in this response. The transcriptional coactivator CaAda2 is also required for expression of many CaCas5-dependent genes, as expected if CaCas5 recruits CaAda2 to activate target gene transcription. Many caspofungin-induced C. albicans genes specify endoplasmic reticulum and secretion functions. Such genes are not induced in S. cerevisiae, but promote its growth in caspofungin. We have used a new resource to identify a key C. albicans transcriptional regulator of CWI genes and antifungal sensitivity.

Commonly, it is assumed that a neuron's role is to encode the stimulus at the tuning curve peak, because high firing rates are the neuron's most distinct responses. In contrast, many theoretical and empirical studies have noted that nearby stimuli are most easily discriminated in high-slope regions of the tuning curve. Here, we demonstrate that both intuitions are correct, but that their relative importance depends on the experimental context and the level of variability in the neuronal response. Using three different information-based measures of encoding applied to experimentally measured sensory neurons, we show how the best-encoded stimulus can transition from high-slope to high-firing-rate regions of the tuning curve with increasing noise level. We further show that our results are consistent with recent experimental findings that correlate neuronal sensitivities with perception and behavior. This study illustrates the importance of the noise level in determining the encoding properties of sensory neurons and provides a unified framework for interpreting how the tuning curve and neuronal variability relate to the overall role of the neuron in sensory encoding.", u'https://figshare.com/articles/Tuning_Curves_Neuronal_Variability_and_Sensory_Coding/153590', [u'Physiology', u'Biological Sciences', u'Neuroscience', u'Medicine', u'Biophysics'], []]

Prior studies using specific archaeal lipid biomarkers and isotopic analyses indicated that planktonic Crenarchaeota have the capacity for autotrophic growth, and more recent cultivation studies support an ammonia-based chemolithoautotrophic energy metabolism. We report here analysis of fosmid sequences derived from the uncultivated marine crenarchaeote, Cenarchaeum symbiosum, focused on the reconstruction of carbon and energy metabolism. Genes predicted to encode multiple components of a modified 3-hydroxypropionate cycle of autotrophic carbon assimilation were identified, consistent with utilization of carbon dioxide as a carbon source. Additionally, genes predicted to encode a near complete oxidative tricarboxylic acid cycle were also identified, consistent with the consumption of organic carbon and in the production of intermediates for amino acid and cofactor biosynthesis. Therefore, C. symbiosum has the potential to function either as a strict autotroph, or as a mixotroph utilizing both carbon dioxide and organic material as carbon sources. From the standpoint of energy metabolism, genes predicted to encode ammonia monooxygenase subunits, ammonia permease, urease, and urea transporters were identified, consistent with the use of reduced nitrogen compounds as energy sources fueling autotrophic metabolism. Homologues of these genes, recovered from ocean waters worldwide, demonstrate the conservation and ubiquity of crenarchaeal pathways for carbon assimilation and ammonia oxidation.

An example of this spontaneous activity is the voltage transition between an Up and a Down state, observed simultaneously at individual neurons. Since this phenomenon could be of critical importance for working memory and attention, its explanation could reveal some fundamental properties of cortical organization. To identify a possible scenario for the dynamics of Up\u2013Down states, we analyze a reduced stochastic dynamical system that models an interconnected network of excitatory neurons with activity-dependent synaptic depression. The model reveals that when the total synaptic connection strength exceeds a certain threshold, the phase space of the dynamical system contains two attractors, interpreted as Up and Down states. In that case, synaptic noise causes transitions between the states. Moreover, an external stimulation producing a depolarization increases the time spent in the Up state, as observed experimentally. We therefore propose that the existence of Up\u2013Down states is a fundamental and inherent property of a noisy neural ensemble with sufficiently strong synaptic connections.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/The_Emergence_of_Up_and_Down_States_in_Cortical_Networks_/152982', [u'Biological Sciences', u'Neuroscience', u'Medicine'], []]

Transcript profiles of wild-type and arrhythmic mutant Drosophila were recorded both in the presence of an environmental photocycle and in constant darkness. Systematic autonomous oscillations in the 12- to 48-h period range were detectable only in wild-type flies and occurred preferentially at the circadian period length. However, an extensive program of light-driven expression was confirmed in arrhythmic mutant flies. Many light-responsive transcripts are preferentially expressed in the compound eyes and the phospholipase C component of phototransduction, NORPA (no receptor potential), is required for their light-dependent regulation. Although there is evidence for the existence of multiple molecular clock circuits in cyanobacteria, protists, plants, and fungi, Drosophila appears to possess only one such system. The sustained photic expression responses identified here are partially coupled to the circadian clock and may reflect a mechanism for flies to modulate functions such as visual sensitivity and synaptic transmission in response to seasonal changes in photoperiod.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Control_of_Daily_Transcript_Oscillations_in_Drosophila_by_Light_and_the_Circadian_Clock/152989', [u'Genetics', u'Biological Sciences', u'Neuroscience', u'Cancer'], []]

The evidence for a significant role of mechanical factors in cortical morphology opens the possibility of constructing computational models of cortical develoment based on physical principles.

To address this, we employ the well-characterized lac operon of Escherichia coli, which has an elaborate input function, intermediate between Boolean AND-gate and OR-gate logic. We mapped in detail the input function of 12 variants of the lac promoter, each with different point mutations in the regulator binding sites, by means of accurate expression measurements from living cells. We find that even a few mutations can significantly change the input function, resulting in functions that resemble Pure AND gates, OR gates, or single-input switches. Other types of gates were not found. The variant input functions can be described in a unified manner by a mathematical model.

Experimental evaluation of this contribution, however, has been difficult. We have systematically dissected the potential contribution to catalysis from electrostatic complementarity in ketosteroid isomerase. Phenolates, analogs of the transition state and reaction intermediate, bind and accept two hydrogen bonds in an active site oxyanion hole. The binding of substituted phenolates of constant molecular shape but increasing p Ka models the charge accumulation in the oxyanion hole during the enzymatic reaction. As charge localization increases, the NMR chemical shifts of protons involved in oxyanion hole hydrogen bonds increase by 0.50\u20130.76 ppm/p Ka unit, suggesting a bond shortening of \u03030.02 \xc5/p Ka unit. Nevertheless, there is little change in binding affinity across a series of substituted phenolates (\u0394\u0394G = \u22120.2 kcal/mol/p Ka unit). The small effect of increased charge localization on affinity occurs despite the shortening of the hydrogen bonds and a large favorable change in binding enthalpy (\u0394\u0394H = \u22122.0 kcal/mol/p Ka unit). This shallow dependence of binding affinity suggests that electrostatic complementarity in the oxyanion hole makes at most a modest contribution to catalysis of \u0303300-fold. We propose that geometrical complementarity between the oxyanion hole hydrogen-bond donors and the transition state oxyanion provides a significant catalytic contribution, and suggest that KSI, like other enzymes, achieves its catalytic prowess through a combination of modest contributions from several mechanisms rather than from a single dominant contribution.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Testing_Electrostatic_Complementarity_in_Enzyme_Catalysis_Hydrogen_Bonding_in_the_Ketosteroid_Isomerase_Oxyanion_Hole/153540', [u'Molecular Biology', u'Biochemistry', u'Biophysics'], []]

We show, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, that brain activity elicited during a new learning episode modulates brain responses to an unrelated cognitive task, during the waking period following the end of training. This post-training activity evolves in learning-related cerebral structures, in which functional connections with other brain regions are gradually established or reinforced. It also correlates with behavioral performance. These processes follow a different time course for hippocampus-dependent and hippocampus-independent memories. Our experimental approach allowed the characterization of the offline evolution of the cerebral correlates of recent memories, without the confounding effect of concurrent practice of the learned material.

Only the human and chimpanzee Y chromosomes have been well characterized at the sequence level. This is primarily due to the presumed low overall gene content and highly repetitive nature of the Y chromosome and the ensuing difficulties using a shotgun sequence approach for assembly. Here we used direct cDNA selection to isolate and evaluate the extent of novel Y chromosome gene acquisition in the genome of the domestic cat, a species from a different mammalian superorder than human, chimpanzee, and mouse (currently being sequenced). We discovered four novel Y chromosome genes that do not have functional copies in the finished human male-specific region of the Y or on other mammalian Y chromosomes explored thus far. Two genes are derived from putative autosomal progenitors, and the other two have X chromosome homologs from different evolutionary strata. All four genes were shown to be multicopy and expressed predominantly or exclusively in testes, suggesting that their duplication and specialization for testis function were selected for because they enhance spermatogenesis. Two of these genes have testis-expressed, Y-borne copies in the dog genome as well. The absence of the four newly described genes on other characterized mammalian Y chromosomes demonstrates the gene novelty on this chromosome between mammalian orders, suggesting it harbors many lineage-specific genes that may go undetected by traditional comparative genomic approaches. Specific plans to identify the male-specific genes encoded in the Y chromosome of mammals should be a priority.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Novel_Gene_Acquisition_on_Carnivore_Y_Chromosomes/152985', [u'Genetics', u'Evolutionary Biology'], []]

However, it has not been reported to mediate heterochromatin formation or heritable silencing for endogenous mammalian genes. Herein, we show that SIRT1 localizes to promoters of several aberrantly silenced tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) in which 5\u2032 CpG islands are densely hypermethylated, but not to these same promoters in cell lines in which the promoters are not hypermethylated and the genes are expressed. Heretofore, only type I and II HDACs, through deactylation of lysines 9 and 14 of histone H3 (H3-K9 and H3-K14, respectively), had been tied to the above TSG silencing. However, inhibition of these enzymes alone fails to re-activate the genes unless DNA methylation is first inhibited. In contrast, inhibition of SIRT1 by pharmacologic, dominant negative, and siRNA (small interfering RNA)\u2013mediated inhibition in breast and colon cancer cells causes increased H4-K16 and H3-K9 acetylation at endogenous promoters and gene re-expression despite full retention of promoter DNA hypermethylation. Furthermore, SIRT1 inhibition affects key phenotypic aspects of cancer cells. We thus have identified a new component of epigenetic TSG silencing that may potentially link some epigenetic changes associated with aging with those found in cancer, and provide new directions for therapeutically targeting these important genes for re-expression.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Inhibition_of_SIRT1_Reactivates_Silenced_Cancer_Genes_without_Loss_of_Promoter_DNA_Hypermethylation/152990', [u'Cancer', u'Genetics'], []]

Mutations or variants that impair function of RNase L, particularly R462Q, have been proposed as susceptibility factors for prostate cancer. Given the role of this gene in viral defense, we sought to explore the possibility that a viral infection might contribute to prostate cancer in individuals harboring the R462Q variant. A viral detection DNA microarray composed of oligonucleotides corresponding to the most conserved sequences of all known viruses identified the presence of gammaretroviral sequences in cDNA samples from seven of 11 R462Q-homozygous (QQ) cases, and in one of eight heterozygous (RQ) and homozygous wild-type (RR) cases. An expanded survey of 86 tumors by specific RT-PCR detected the virus in eight of 20 QQ cases (40%), compared with only one sample (1.5%) among 66 RQ and RR cases. The full-length viral genome was cloned and sequenced independently from three positive QQ cases. The virus, named XMRV, is closely related to xenotropic murine leukemia viruses (MuLVs), but its sequence is clearly distinct from all known members of this group. Comparison of gag and pol sequences from different tumor isolates suggested infection with the same virus in all cases, yet sequence variation was consistent with the infections being independently acquired. Analysis of prostate tissues from XMRV-positive cases by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry showed that XMRV nucleic acid and protein can be detected in about 1% of stromal cells, predominantly fibroblasts and hematopoietic elements in regions adjacent to the carcinoma. These data provide to our knowledge the first demonstration that xenotropic MuLV-related viruses can produce an authentic human infection, and strongly implicate RNase L activity in the prevention or clearance of infection in vivo.

Initial single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based association implicated PRKCA (protein kinase C alpha) gene, and this association was replicated in an independent set of 148 Finnish MS families (p = 0.0004; remaining significant after correction for multiple testing). Further, a dense set of 211 SNPs evenly covering the PRKCA gene and the flanking regions was selected from the dbSNP database and analyzed in two large, independent MS cohorts: in 211 Finnish and 554 Canadian MS families. A multipoint SNP analysis indicated linkage to PRKCA and its telomeric flanking region in both populations, and SNP haplotype and genotype combination analyses revealed an allelic variant of PRKCA, which covers the region between introns 3 and 8, to be over-represented in Finnish MS cases (odds ratio = 1.34, 95% confidence interval 1.07\u20131.68).

We also used sequences available in GenBank for the mitochondrial genes cytochrome B and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1. A multidimensional scaling plot (MDS) based in microsatellite data divided the parasites into four clusters corresponding to T. cruzi I (MDS-cluster A), T. cruzi II (MDS-cluster C), a third group of T. cruzi strains (MDS-cluster B), and hybrid strains (MDS-cluster BH). The first two clusters matched respectively mitochondrial clades A and C, while the other two belonged to mitochondrial clade B. The 24S\u03b1 rDNA and microsatellite profiling data were combined into multilocus genotypes that were analyzed by the haplotype reconstruction program PHASE. We identified 141 haplotypes that were clearly distributed into three haplogroups (X, Y, and Z). All strains belonging to T. cruzi I (MDS-cluster A) were Z/Z, the T. cruzi II strains (MDS-cluster C) were Y/Y, and those belonging to MDS-cluster B (unclassified T. cruzi) had X/X haplogroup genotypes. The strains grouped in the MDS-cluster BH were X/Y, confirming their hybrid character. Based on these results we propose the following minimal scenario for T. cruzi evolution. In a distant past there were at a minimum three ancestral lineages that we may call, respectively, T. cruzi I, T. cruzi II, and T. cruzi III. At least two hybridization events involving T. cruzi II and T. cruzi III produced evolutionarily viable progeny.

[u'Dynamical Principles of Two-Component Genetic Oscillators', ['Raul Guantes', 'Juan F Poyatos'], u'2006-03-31T01:02:40Z', u'Genetic oscillators based on the interaction of a small set of molecular components have been shown to be involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, the circadian rhythms, or the response of several signaling pathways. Uncovering the functional properties of such oscillators then becomes important for the understanding of these cellular processes and for the characterization of fundamental properties of more complex clocks. Here, we show how the dynamics of a minimal two-component oscillator is drastically affected by its genetic implementation. We consider a repressor and activator element combined in a simple logical motif. While activation is always exerted at the transcriptional level, repression is alternatively operating at the transcriptional (Design I) or post-translational (Design II) level. These designs display differences on basic oscillatory features and on their behavior with respect to molecular noise or entrainment by periodic signals. In particular, Design I induces oscillations with large activator amplitudes and arbitrarily small frequencies, and acts as an \u201cintegrator\u201d of external stimuli, while Design II shows emergence of oscillations with finite, and less variable, frequencies and smaller amplitudes, and detects better frequency-encoded signals (\u201cresonator\u201d). Similar types of stimulus response are observed in neurons, and thus this work enables us to connect very different biological contexts. These dynamical principles are relevant for the characterization of the physiological roles of simple oscillator motifs, the understanding of core machineries of complex clocks, and the bio-engineering of synthetic oscillatory circuits.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Dynamical_Principles_of_Two_Component_Genetic_Oscillators_/153760', [u'Cell Biology', u'Medicine'], []]

As with any drug-based intervention strategy, it is important to understand how implementation may affect the spread of drug-resistant parasites.

Because exceptional longevity in humans is familial, it is likely that polymorphisms in genes favorably influence certain phenotypes and increase the likelihood of exceptional longevity.

The prevalence of homozygosity for the \u2212641C allele in the APOC3 promoter (rs2542052) was higher in centenarians (25%) and their offspring (20%) than in controls (10%) ( p = 0.0001 and p = 0.001, respectively). This genotype was associated with significantly lower serum levels of APOC3 and a favorable pattern of lipoprotein levels and sizes. We found a lower prevalence of hypertension and greater insulin sensitivity in the \u2212641C homozygotes, suggesting a protective effect against CVD and the metabolic syndrome. Finally, in a prospectively studied cohort, a significant survival advantage was demonstrated in those with the favorable \u2212641C homozygote ( p < 0.0001). Homozygosity for the APOC3 \u2212641C allele is associated with a favorable lipoprotein profile, cardiovascular health, insulin sensitivity, and longevity.

In the most well-understood \u201ccanonical\u201d Wnt signaling pathway, Wnt binding to Frizzled receptors induces \u03b2-catenin protein stabilization and entry into the nucleus, where it complexes with T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor transcription factors to affect the transcription of target genes. In addition to the canonical pathway, evidence for several other Wnt signaling pathways has accumulated, in particular for Wnt5a, which has therefore been classified as a noncanonical Wnt family member. To study the alternative mechanisms by which Wnt proteins signal, we purified the Wnt5a protein to homogeneity. We find that purified Wnt5a inhibits Wnt3a protein\u2013induced canonical Wnt signaling in a dose-dependent manner, not by influencing \u03b2-catenin levels but by downregulating \u03b2-catenin\u2013induced reporter gene expression. The Wnt5a signal is mediated by the orphan tyrosine kinase Ror2, is pertussis toxin insensitive, and does not influence cellular calcium levels. We show that in addition to its inhibitory function, Wnt5a can also activate \u03b2-catenin signaling in the presence of the appropriate Frizzled receptor, Frizzled 4. Thus, this study shows for the first time that a single Wnt ligand can initiate discrete signaling pathways through the activation of two distinct receptors. Based on these and additional observations, we propose a model wherein receptor context dictates Wnt signaling output. In this model, signaling by different Wnt family members is not intrinsically regulated by the Wnt proteins themselves but by receptor availability.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Purified_Wnt5a_Protein_Activates_or_Inhibits_Catenin_TCF_Signaling_Depending_on_Receptor_Context/153462', [u'Molecular Biology', u'Biochemistry', u'Cancer', u'Cell Biology', u'Developmental Biology'], []]

Though first described in the model organism Escherichia coli in the early 1960s, only scant information on the mechanism(s) of amplification in this system has been obtained, and many models for mechanism(s) were possible. More recently, some gene amplifications in E. coli were shown to be stress-inducible and to confer a selective advantage to cells under stress (adaptive amplifications), potentially accelerating evolution specifically when cells are poorly adapted to their environment. We focus on stress-induced amplification in E. coli and report several findings that indicate a novel molecular mechanism, and we suggest that most amplifications might be stress-induced, not spontaneous. First, as often hypothesized, but not shown previously, certain proteins used for DNA double-strand-break repair and homologous recombination are required for amplification. Second, in contrast with previous models in which homologous recombination between repeated sequences caused duplications that lead to amplification, the amplified DNAs are present in situ as tandem, direct repeats of 7\u201332 kilobases bordered by only 4 to 15 base pairs of G-rich homology, indicating an initial non-homologous recombination event. Sequences at the rearrangement junctions suggest nonhomologous recombination mechanisms that occur via template switching during DNA replication, but unlike previously described template switching events, these must occur over long distances. Third, we provide evidence that 3\u2032-single-strand DNA ends are intermediates in the process, supporting a template-switching mechanism. Fourth, we provide evidence that lagging-strand templates are involved. Finally, we propose a novel, long-distance template-switching model for the mechanism of adaptive amplification that suggests how stress induces the amplifications. We outline its possible applicability to amplification in humans and other organisms and circumstances.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/On_the_Mechanism_of_Gene_Amplification_Induced_under_Stress_in_Escherichia_coli_/152971', [u'Molecular Biology', u'Genetics', u'Evolutionary Biology'], []]

Incomplete erasure at genes associated with a measurable phenotype results in unusual patterns of inheritance from one generation to the next, termed transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. The Agouti viable yellow (Avy) allele is the best-studied example of this phenomenon in mice. The Avy allele is the result of a retrotransposon insertion upstream of the Agouti gene. Expression at this locus is controlled by the long terminal repeat (LTR) of the retrotransposon, and expression results in a yellow coat and correlates with hypomethylation of the LTR. Isogenic mice display variable expressivity, resulting in mice with a range of coat colours, from yellow through to agouti. Agouti mice have a methylated LTR. The locus displays epigenetic inheritance following maternal but not paternal transmission; yellow mothers produce more yellow offspring than agouti mothers. We have analysed the DNA methylation in mature gametes, zygotes, and blastocysts and found that the paternally and maternally inherited alleles are treated differently. The paternally inherited allele is demethylated rapidly, and the maternal allele is demethylated more slowly, in a manner similar to that of nonimprinted single-copy genes. Interestingly, following maternal transmission of the allele, there is no DNA methylation in the blastocyst, suggesting that DNA methylation is not the inherited mark. We have independent support for this conclusion from studies that do not involve direct analysis of DNA methylation. Haplo-insufficiency for Mel18, a polycomb group protein, introduces epigenetic inheritance at a paternally derived Avy allele, and the pedigrees reveal that this occurs after zygotic genome activation and, therefore, despite the rapid demethylation of the locus.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Dynamic_Reprogramming_of_DNA_Methylation_at_an_Epigenetically_Sensitive_Allele_in_Mice/153031', [u'Genetics'], []]
[u'A Model for Integrating Elementary Neural Functions into Delayed-Response Behavior', ['Thomas Gisiger', 'Michel Kerszberg'], u'2006-04-07T00:50:46Z', u'It is well established that various cortical regions can implement a wide array of neural processes, yet the mechanisms which integrate these processes into behavior-producing, brain-scale activity remain elusive. We propose that an important role in this respect might be played by executive structures controlling the traffic of information between the cortical regions involved. To illustrate this hypothesis, we present a neural network model comprising a set of interconnected structures harboring stimulus-related activity (visual representation, working memory, and planning), and a group of executive units with task-related activity patterns that manage the information flowing between them. The resulting dynamics allows the network to perform the dual task of either retaining an image during a delay (delayed-matching to sample task), or recalling from this image another one that has been associated with it during training (delayed-pair association task). The model reproduces behavioral and electrophysiological data gathered on the inferior temporal and prefrontal cortices of primates performing these same tasks. It also makes predictions on how neural activity coding for the recall of the image associated with the sample emerges and becomes prospective during the training phase. The network dynamics proves to be very stable against perturbations, and it exhibits signs of scale-invariant organization and cooperativity. The present network represents a possible neural implementation for active, top-down, prospective memory retrieval in primates. The model suggests that brain activity leading to performance of cognitive tasks might be organized in modular fashion, simple neural functions becoming integrated into more complex behavior by executive structures harbored in prefrontal cortex and/or basal ganglia.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/A_Model_for_Integrating_Elementary_Neural_Functions_into_Delayed_Response_Behavior/153046', [u'Mental Health', u'Biological Sciences', u'Neuroscience', u'Cancer'], []]

The gene for MEN1 encodes a ubiquitously expressed tumor suppressor protein called menin. Menin was recently shown to interact with several components of a trithorax family histone methyltransferase complex including ASH2, Rbbp5, WDR5, and the leukemia proto-oncoprotein MLL. To elucidate menin's role as a tumor suppressor and gain insights into the endocrine-specific tumor phenotype in MEN1, we mapped the genomic binding sites of menin, MLL1, and Rbbp5, to approximately 20,000 promoters in HeLa S3, HepG2, and pancreatic islet cells using the strategy of chromatin-immunoprecipitation coupled with microarray analysis. We found that menin, MLL1, and Rbbp5 localize to the promoters of thousands of human genes but do not always bind together. These data suggest that menin functions as a general regulator of transcription. We also found that factor occupancy generally correlates with high gene expression but that the loss of menin does not result in significant changes in most transcript levels. One exception is the developmentally programmed transcription factor, HLXB9, which is overexpressed in islets in the absence of menin.

In basal culture conditions, the majority of ES cells convert asynchronously into neural cells. However, many cells resist differentiation and others adopt nonneural fates. Mosaic activation of the neural reporter Sox-green fluorescent protein suggests regulation by cell-cell interactions. We detected expression of Notch receptors and ligands in mouse ES cells and investigated the role of this pathway. Genetic manipulation to activate Notch constitutively does not alter the stem cell phenotype. However, upon withdrawal of self-renewal stimuli, differentiation is directed rapidly and exclusively into the neural lineage. Conversely, pharmacological or genetic interference with Notch signalling suppresses the neural fate choice. Notch promotion of neural commitment requires parallel signalling through the fibroblast growth factor receptor. Stromal cells expressing Notch ligand stimulate neural specification of human ES cells, indicating that this is a conserved pathway in pluripotent stem cells. These findings define an unexpected and decisive role for Notch in ES cell fate determination. Limiting activation of endogenous Notch results in heterogeneous lineage commitment. Manipulation of Notch signalling is therefore likely to be a key factor in taking command of ES cell lineage choice.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Notch_Promotes_Neural_Lineage_Entry_by_Pluripotent_Embryonic_Stem_Cells/153567', [u'Biotechnology', u'Neuroscience', u'Cell Biology', u'Genetics', u'Developmental Biology'], []]

In Listeria monocytogenes, MogR tightly represses expression of flagellin (FlaA) during extracellular growth at 37 \xb0C and during intracellular infection. MogR is also required for full virulence in a murine model of infection. Using in vitro and in vivo infection models, we determined that the severe virulence defect of MogR-negative bacteria is due to overexpression of FlaA. Specifically, overproduction of FlaA in MogR-negative bacteria caused pleiotropic defects in bacterial division (chaining phenotype), intracellular spread, and virulence in mice. DNA binding and microarray analyses revealed that MogR represses transcription of all known flagellar motility genes by binding directly to a minimum of two TTTT-N5-AAAA recognition sites positioned within promoter regions such that RNA polymerase binding is occluded. Analysis of MogR protein levels demonstrated that modulation of MogR repression activity confers the temperature-specificity to flagellar motility gene expression. Epistasis analysis revealed that MogR repression of transcription is antagonized in a temperature-dependent manner by the DegU response regulator and that DegU further regulates FlaA levels through a posttranscriptional mechanism.

Despite cleavage and avid binding, PrPSc bound to Mte remained infectious. Results from our study suggest that PrPSc released into soil environments may be preserved in a bioavailable form, perpetuating prion disease epizootics and exposing other species to the infectious agent.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Prions_Adhere_to_Soil_Minerals_and_Remain_Infectious/152997', [u'Cancer', u'Biochemistry', u'Science Policy'], []]

Among modern humans, the pursuit and interception of moving targets plays a central role in a variety of sports, such as tennis, football, Frisbee, and baseball. Studies of target pursuit in animals, ranging from dragonflies to fish and dogs to humans, have suggested that they all use a constant bearing (CB) strategy to pursue prey or other moving targets. CB is best known as the interception strategy employed by baseball outfielders to catch ballistic fly balls. CB is a time-optimal solution to catch targets moving along a straight line, or in a predictable fashion\u2014such as a ballistic baseball, or a piece of food sinking in water. Many animals, however, have to capture prey that may make evasive and unpredictable maneuvers. Is CB an optimum solution to pursuing erratically moving targets? Do animals faced with such erratic prey also use CB? In this paper, we address these questions by studying prey capture in an insectivorous echolocating bat. Echolocating bats rely on sonar to pursue and capture flying insects. The bat's prey may emerge from foliage for a brief time, fly in erratic three-dimensional paths before returning to cover. Bats typically take less than one second to detect, localize and capture such insects. We used high speed stereo infra-red videography to study the three dimensional flight paths of the big brown bat, Eptesicus fuscus, as it chased erratically moving insects in a dark laboratory flight room. We quantified the bat's complex pursuit trajectories using a simple delay differential equation. Our analysis of the pursuit trajectories suggests that bats use a constant absolute target direction strategy during pursuit. We show mathematically that, unlike CB, this approach minimizes the time it takes for a pursuer to intercept an unpredictably moving target. Interestingly, the bat's behavior is similar to the interception strategy implemented in some guided missiles. We suggest that the time-optimal strategy adopted by the bat is in response to the evolutionary pressures of having to capture erratic and fast moving insects.", u'https://figshare.com/articles/Echolocating_Bats_Use_a_Nearly_Time_Optimal_Strategy_to_Intercept_Prey/153468', [u'Mental Health', u'Biological Sciences', u'Neuroscience', u'Medicine', u'Cancer'], []]

The paralemniscal pathway conveys sensor motion (whisking) signals, the extralemniscal conveys contact (touch) signals, and the lemniscal pathway conveys combined whisking\u2013touch signals.

Indeed, under a variety of conditions, functions attributed to specialized areas can be supported by other regions. However, a host of studies have laid out an ever more detailed map of functional cortical areas. This leaves us with the puzzle of whether different cortical areas are intrinsically specialized, or whether they differ mostly by their position in the processing hierarchy and their inputs but apply the same computational principles. Here we show that the computational principle of optimal stability of sensory representations combined with local memory gives rise to a hierarchy of processing stages resembling the ventral visual pathway when it is exposed to continuous natural stimuli. Early processing stages show receptive fields similar to those observed in the primary visual cortex. Subsequent stages are selective for increasingly complex configurations of local features, as observed in higher visual areas. The last stage of the model displays place fields as observed in entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. The results suggest that functionally heterogeneous cortical areas can be generated by only a few computational principles and highlight the importance of the variability of the input signals in forming functional specialization.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/A_Model_of_the_Ventral_Visual_System_Based_on_Temporal_Stability_and_Local_Memory/153562', [u'Biological Sciences', u'Neuroscience'], []]

We used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with genomic tiling path microarrays to analyze the binding profile of the PcG proteins Polycomb (PC) and Polyhomeotic (PH) across 10 Mb of euchromatin. We also analyzed the distribution of GAGA factor (GAF), a sequence-specific DNA binding protein that is found at most previously identified PREs. Our data show that PC and PH often bind to clustered regions within large loci that encode transcription factors which play multiple roles in developmental patterning and in the regulation of cell proliferation. GAF co-localizes with PC and PH to a limited extent, suggesting that GAF is not a necessary component of chromatin at PREs.

One of the clusters identified in each of the organisms is found to be related to expression levels, as expected, but other groups feature an over-representation of genes belonging to different functional groups, namely horizontally transferred genes, motility, and intermediary metabolism. Furthermore, we show that genes with a similar bias tend to be close to each other on the chromosome and organized in coherent domains, more extended than operons, demonstrating a role of translation in structuring bacterial chromosomes. It is argued that a sizeable contribution to this effect comes from the dynamical compartimentalization induced by the recycling of tRNAs, leading to gene expression rates dependent on their genomic and expression context.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Codon_Usage_Domains_over_Bacterial_Chromosomes/152959', [u'Mathematics', u'Molecular Biology', u'Biological Sciences', u'Medicine', u'Microbiology'], []]

In this work, we examine how phosphorylation can modulate the conformation of a protein by changing the energy landscape. We present a molecular mechanics method in which we phosphorylate proteins in silico and then predict how the conformation of the protein will change in response to phosphorylation. We apply this method to a test set comprised of proteins with both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated crystal structures, and demonstrate that it is possible to predict localized phosphorylation-induced conformational changes, or the absence of conformational changes, with near-atomic accuracy in most cases. Examples of proteins used for testing our methods include kinases and prokaryotic response regulators. Through a detailed case study of cyclin-dependent kinase 2, we also illustrate how the computational methods can be used to provide new understanding of how phosphorylation drives conformational change, why substituting Glu or Asp for a phosphorylated amino acid does not always mimic the effects of phosphorylation, and how a phosphatase can \u201ccapture\u201d a phosphorylated amino acid.

The protein, Atrx, was ubiquitously expressed, and male embryos null for Atrx implanted and gastrulated normally but did not survive beyond 9.5 days postcoitus due to a defect in formation of the extraembryonic trophoblast, one of the first terminally differentiated lineages in the developing embryo. Carrier female mice that inherit a maternal null allele should be affected, since the paternal X chromosome is normally inactivated in extraembryonic tissues. Surprisingly, however, some carrier females established a normal placenta and appeared to escape the usual pattern of imprinted X-inactivation in these tissues. Together these findings demonstrate an unexpected, specific, and essential role for Atrx in the development of the murine trophoblast and present an example of escape from imprinted X chromosome inactivation.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Loss_of_Atrx_Affects_Trophoblast_Development_and_the_Pattern_of_X_Inactivation_in_Extraembryonic_Tissues/152983', [u'Hematology', u'Developmental Biology', u'Genetics', u'Cell Biology'], []]

Because assembly of other membrane proteins requires specific interactions along extended stretches of transmembrane helices, we examined how transmembrane sequences flanking the polar interaction site contribute to assembly for three receptors that associate with different signaling modules\u2014the natural killer cell receptors KIR and NKG2D and the Fc receptor for IgA, Fc\u03b1RI. The KIR and NKG2D receptors assembled with the DAP12 and DAP10 dimers, respectively, even when the entire KIR or NKG2D transmembrane domains were replaced by polyleucine sequences with a properly positioned basic residue. In contrast, a high degree of specificity for the basic side chain could be observed because the KIR\u2013DAP12 and Fc\u03b1RI\u2013Fc\u03b3 interactions favored lysine or arginine, respectively. Steric hindrance among incompatible extra-membranous domains and competition for signaling modules also contributed to specificity of assembly. These results demonstrate that these interactions are focused on the polar site created by three ionizable transmembrane residues, and explain how the DAP12 and Fc\u03b3 signaling modules can assemble with large, non-overlapping sets of receptors that have highly divergent transmembrane sequences.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/The_Assembly_of_Diverse_Immune_Receptors_Is_Focused_on_a_Polar_Membrane_Embedded_Interaction_Site/153419', [u'Molecular Biology', u'Biochemistry', u'Biophysics', u'Immunology'], []]

Here we analyse hundreds of well-characterised local populations in a large metapopulation of the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia), which persists in a balance between stochastic local extinctions and recolonisations in a network of 4,000 discrete habitat patches. We show that the allelic composition of the glycolytic enzyme phosphoglucose isomerase (Pgi) has a significant effect on the growth of local populations, consistent with previously reported effects of allelic variation on flight metabolic performance and fecundity in the Glanville fritillary and Colias butterflies. The strength and the sign of the molecular effect on population growth are sensitive to the ecological context (the area and spatial connectivity of the habitat patches), which affects genotype-specific gene flow and the influence of migration on the dynamics of local populations. The biological significance of the results for Pgi is underscored by lack of any association between population growth and allelic variation at six other loci typed in the same material. In demonstrating, to our knowledge for the first time, that molecular variation in a candidate gene affects population growth, this study challenges the perception that differential performance of individual genotypes, leading to differential fitness, is irrelevant to population dynamics. These results also demonstrate that the spatial configuration of habitat and spatial dynamics of populations contribute to maintenance of Pgi polymorphism in this species.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Molecular_Level_Variation_Affects_Population_Growth_in_a_Butterfly_Metapopulation/153427', [u'Ecology', u'Genetics', u'Evolutionary Biology'], []]

In this table, a correspondence between each codon and each amino acid is established: tRNA is the main adaptor that links the two. Although the genetic code is nearly universal, several variants of this code have been described in a wide range of nuclear and organellar systems, especially in metazoan mitochondria. These variants are generally found by searching for conserved positions that consistently code for a specific alternative amino acid in a new species. We have devised an accurate computational method to automate these comparisons, and have tested it with 626 metazoan mitochondrial genomes. Our results indicate that several arthropods have a new genetic code and translate the codon AGG as lysine instead of serine (as in the invertebrate mitochondrial genetic code) or arginine (as in the standard genetic code). We have investigated the evolution of the genetic code in the arthropods and found several events of parallel evolution in which the AGG codon was reassigned between serine and lysine. Our analyses also revealed correlated evolution between the arthropod genetic codes and the tRNA-Lys/-Ser, which show specific point mutations at the anticodons. These rather simple mutations, together with a low usage of the AGG codon, might explain the recurrence of the AGG reassignments.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Parallel_Evolution_of_the_Genetic_Code_in_Arthropod_Mitochondrial_Genomes/153521', [u'Biological Sciences', u'Genetics', u'Evolutionary Biology'], []]

In re-addressing several controversial claims, we recently proposed a model in which mouse embryonic polarity is not specified until the blastocyst stage. Before fertilization, the fully differentiated oocyte has been characterized as \u201cpolarized,\u201d and we indeed observed that the sperm preferentially enters the polar body half. Here we show that preferential sperm entry is not due to an intrinsic polarity of the oocyte, since fertilization takes place uniformly when the zona pellucida is removed. We suggest that the term \u201casymmetry\u201d denotes morphological differences, whereas \u201cpolarity\u201d in addition implies developmental consequences. Thus, the mouse oocyte can be considered \u201casymmetric\u201d but \u201cnon-polarized.\u201d The penetration through the zona pellucida is also random, and a significant proportion of sperm binds to the oocyte membrane at a point distant from the zona penetration site. Time-lapse recordings confirmed that sperm swim around the perivitelline space before fertilization. Experimental enlargement of the perivitelline space in the non-polar body half increased the regional probability of fertilization. Based on these experiments, we propose a model in which the space asymmetry exerted by the first polar body and the zona pellucida directs sperm entry preferentially to the polar body half, with no need for oocyte polarity.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Space_Asymmetry_Directs_Preferential_Sperm_Entry_in_the_Absence_of_Polarity_in_the_Mouse_Oocyte/153523', [u'Developmental Biology'], []]
[u'Intermingling of Chromosome Territories in Interphase Suggests Role in Translocations and Transcription-Dependent Associations', ['Miguel R Branco', 'Ana Pombo'], u'2006-04-25T00:59:42Z', u'After mitosis, mammalian chromosomes partially decondense to occupy distinct territories in the cell nucleus. Current models propose that territories are separated by an interchromatin domain, rich in soluble nuclear machinery, where only rare interchromosomal interactions can occur via extended chromatin loops. In contrast, recent evidence for chromatin mobility and high frequency of chromosome translocations are consistent with significant levels of chromosome intermingling, with important consequences for genome function and stability. Here we use a novel high-resolution in situ hybridization procedure that preserves chromatin nanostructure to show that chromosome territories intermingle significantly in the nucleus of human cells. The degree of intermingling between specific chromosome pairs in human lymphocytes correlates with the frequency of chromosome translocations in the same cell type, implying that double-strand breaks formed within areas of intermingling are more likely to participate in interchromosomal rearrangements. The presence of transcription factories in regions of intermingling and the effect of transcription impairment on the interactions between chromosomes shows that transcription-dependent interchromosomal associations shape chromosome organization in mammalian cells. These findings suggest that local chromatin conformation and gene transcription influence the extent with which chromosomes interact and affect their overall properties, with direct consequences for cell-type specific genome stability.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Intermingling_of_Chromosome_Territories_in_Interphase_Suggests_Role_in_Translocations_and_Transcription_Dependent_Associations/153582', [u'Hematology', u'Biophysics', u'Cancer', u'Molecular Biology', u'Cell Biology', u'Genetics'], []]

The standard approach has been to reject neutrality in favor of selection if the pattern of variation at a candidate locus was significantly different from the predictions of the standard neutral model. The problem is that the standard neutral model assumes more than just neutrality, and it is almost always possible to explain the data using an alternative neutral model with more complex demography. Today's wealth of genomic polymorphism data, however, makes it possible to dispense with models altogether by simply comparing the pattern observed at a candidate locus to the genomic pattern, and rejecting neutrality if the pattern is extreme. Here, we utilize this approach on a truly genomic scale, comparing a candidate locus to thousands of alleles throughout the Arabidopsis thaliana genome. We demonstrate that selection has acted to increase the frequency of early-flowering alleles at the vernalization requirement locus FRIGIDA. Selection seems to have occurred during the last several thousand years, possibly in response to the spread of agriculture.

Among these, three-nucleotide variations at so-called NAGNAG tandem acceptor sites have recently attracted considerable attention, and it has been suggested that these variations are regulated and serve to fine-tune protein forms by the addition or removal of a single amino acid. In this paper we first show that in-frame exon length variations are generally overrepresented and that this overrepresentation can be quantitatively explained by the effect of nonsense-mediated decay. Our analysis allows us to estimate that about 50% of frame-shifted coding transcripts are targeted by nonsense-mediated decay. Second, we show that a simple physical model that assumes that the splicing machinery stochastically binds to nearby splice sites in proportion to the affinities of the sites correctly predicts the relative abundances of different small length variations at both boundaries. Finally, using the same simple physical model, we show that for NAGNAG sites, the difference in affinities of the neighboring sites for the splicing machinery accurately predicts whether splicing will occur only at the first site, splicing will occur only at the second site, or three-nucleotide splice variants are likely to occur. Our analysis thus suggests that small exon length variations are the result of stochastic binding of the spliceosome at neighboring splice sites. Small exon length variations occur when there are nearby alternative splice sites that have similar affinity for the splicing machinery.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/A_Simple_Physical_Model_Predicts_Small_Exon_Length_Variations/152946', [u'Biotechnology', u'Biological Sciences', u'Genetics', u'Evolutionary Biology'], []]

Although much recent attention has focused on tiny 22- to 25-nucleotide microRNAs, several functional ncRNAs are orders of magnitude larger in size. Examples of such macro ncRNAs include Xist and Air, which in mouse are 18 and 108 kilobases (Kb), respectively. We surveyed the 102,801 FANTOM3 mouse cDNA clones and found that Air and Xist were present not as single, full-length transcripts but as a cluster of multiple, shorter cDNAs, which were unspliced, had little coding potential, and were most likely primed from internal adenine-rich regions within longer parental transcripts. We therefore conducted a genome-wide search for regional clusters of such cDNAs to find novel macro ncRNA candidates. Sixty-six regions were identified, each of which mapped outside known protein-coding loci and which had a mean length of 92 Kb. We detected several known long ncRNAs within these regions, supporting the basic rationale of our approach. In silico analysis showed that many regions had evidence of imprinting and/or antisense transcription. These regions were significantly associated with microRNAs and transcripts from the central nervous system. We selected eight novel regions for experimental validation by northern blot and RT-PCR and found that the majority represent previously unrecognized noncoding transcripts that are at least 10 Kb in size and predominantly localized in the nucleus. Taken together, the data not only identify multiple new ncRNAs but also suggest the existence of many more macro ncRNAs like Xist and Air.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Clusters_of_Internally_Primed_Transcripts_Reveal_Novel_Long_Noncoding_RNAs/152949', [u'Genetics', u'Biotechnology', u'Biological Sciences', u'Molecular Biology', u'Evolutionary Biology'], []]

J Chain', 'Ben J Evans'], u'2006-04-28T00:49:10Z', u'Gene duplication provides a window of opportunity for biological variants to persist under the protection of a co-expressed copy with similar or redundant function. Duplication catalyzes innovation (neofunctionalization), subfunction degeneration (subfunctionalization), and genetic buffering (redundancy), and the genetic survival of each paralog is triggered by mechanisms that add, compromise, or do not alter protein function. We tested the applicability of three types of mechanisms for promoting the retained expression of duplicated genes in 290 expressed paralogs of the tetraploid clawed frog, Xenopus laevis. Tests were based on explicit expectations concerning the ka/ks ratio, and the number and location of nonsynonymous substitutions after duplication. Functional constraints on the majority of paralogs are not significantly different from a singleton ortholog. However, we recover strong support that some of them have an asymmetric rate of nonsynonymous substitution: 6% match predictions of the neofunctionalization hypothesis in that (1) each paralog accumulated nonsynonymous substitutions at a significantly different rate and (2) the one that evolves faster has a higher ka/ks ratio than the other paralog and than a singleton ortholog. Fewer paralogs (3%) exhibit a complementary pattern of substitution at the protein level that is predicted by enhancement or degradation of different functional domains, and the remaining 13% have a higher average ka/ks ratio in both paralogs that is consistent with altered functional constraints, diversifying selection, or activity-reducing mutations after duplication. We estimate that these paralogs have been retained since they originated by genome duplication between 21 and 41 million years ago. Multiple mechanisms operate to promote the retained expression of duplicates in the same genome, in genes in the same functional class, over the same period of time following duplication, and sometimes in the same pair of paralogs. None of these paralogs are superfluous; degradation or enhancement of different protein subfunctions and neofunctionalization are plausible hypotheses for the retained expression of some of them. Evolution of most X. laevis paralogs, however, is consistent with retained expression via mechanisms that do not radically alter functional constraints, such as selection to preserve post-duplication stoichiometry or temporal, quantitative, or spatial subfunctionalization.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Multiple_Mechanisms_Promote_the_Retained_Expression_of_Gene_Duplicates_in_the_Tetraploid_Frog_Xenopus_laevis_/152950', [u'Genetics', u'Evolutionary Biology'], []]

With 30,969 well-defined TSSs from mouse and 26,341 from human, there are sufficient numbers to draw statistically meaningful conclusions and to consider differences between promoter types. Unlike previous smaller studies, we have considered the effects of insertions, deletions, and transposable elements as well as nucleotide substitutions. The rate of promoter evolution relative to that of control sequences has not been consistent between lineages nor within lineages over time. The most pronounced manifestation of this heterotachy is the increased rate of evolution in primate promoters. This increase is seen across different classes of mutation, including substitutions and micro-indel events. We investigated the relationship between promoter and coding sequence selective constraint and suggest that they are generally uncorrelated. This analysis also identified a small number of mouse promoters associated with the immune response that are under positive selection in rodents. We demonstrate significant differences in divergence between functional promoter categories and identify a category of promoters, not associated with conventional protein-coding genes, that has the highest rates of divergence across mammals. We find that evolutionary rates vary both on a fine scale within mammalian promoters and also between different functional classes of promoters. The discovery of heterotachy in promoter evolution, in particular the accelerated evolution of primate promoters, has important implications for our understanding of human evolution and for strategies to detect primate-specific regulatory elements.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Heterotachy_in_Mammalian_Promoter_Evolution/152951', [u'Biotechnology', u'Biological Sciences', u'Genetics', u'Evolutionary Biology'], []]

The emerging consensus is that formation of this compartment involves recruitment of membrane material that traffics between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi. To investigate this model, a targeted approach was used to knock down expression of proteins involved in membrane trafficking, using RNA interference in Drosophila cells. Surprisingly, few single knockdowns of ER\u2013Golgi transport proteins decreased L. pneumophila replication. By analyzing double-stranded RNAs in pairs, combinations were identified that together caused defects in intracellular replication, consistent with the model that membrane traffic funnels into the replication vacuole from multiple sources. In particular, simultaneous depletion of the intermediate compartment and Golgi-tethering factor transport protein particle together with the ER SNARE protein Sec22 reduced replication efficiency, indicating that introduction of lesions at distinct sites in the secretory system reduces replication efficiency. In contrast to knockdowns in secretory traffic, which required multiple simultaneous hits, knockdown of single cytosolic components of ER-associated degradation, including Cdc48/p97 and associated cofactors, was sufficient to inhibit intracellular replication. The requirement for the Cdc48/p97 complex was conserved in mammalian cells, in which replication vacuoles showed intense recruitment of ubiquitinated proteins, the preferred substrates of Cdc48/p97. This complex promoted dislocation of both ubiquitinated proteins and bacterial effectors from the replication vacuole, consistent with the model that maintenance of high-level replication requires surveillance of the vacuole surface. This work demonstrates that L. pneumophila has the ability to gain access to multiple sites in the secretory system and provides the first evidence for a role of the Cdc48/p97 complex in promoting intracellular replication of pathogens and maintenance of replication vacuoles.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/RNA_Interference_Analysis_of_Legionella_in_Drosophila_Cells_Exploitation_of_Early_Secretory_Apparatus_Dynamics/152952', [u'Cancer', u'Microbiology'], []]

These comprise not only transcribed pseudogenes, but also disrupted splice variants of otherwise protein-coding genes. Some may encode truncated proteins, only a minority of which appear subject to nonsense-mediated decay. The presence of an excess of transcripts whose only disruptions are opal stop codons suggests that there are more selenoproteins than currently estimated. We also describe compensatory frameshifts, where a segment of the gene has changed frame but remains translatable. In summary, we survey a large class of non-standard but potentially functional transcripts that are likely to encode genetic information and effect biological processes in novel ways.

Ever more transcripts that do not code for proteins have been identified by transcriptome studies, in general. Increasing evidence points to the important cellular roles of such non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). The distinction of protein-coding RNA transcripts from ncRNA transcripts is therefore an important problem in understanding the transcriptome and carrying out its annotation. Very few in silico methods have specifically addressed this problem. Here, we introduce CONC (for \u201ccoding or non-coding\u201d), a novel method based on support vector machines that classifies transcripts according to features they would have if they were coding for proteins. These features include peptide length, amino acid composition, predicted secondary structure content, predicted percentage of exposed residues, compositional entropy, number of homologs from database searches, and alignment entropy. Nucleotide frequencies are also incorporated into the method. Confirmed coding cDNAs for eukaryotic proteins from the Swiss-Prot database constituted the set of true positives, ncRNAs from RNAdb and NONCODE the true negatives. Ten-fold cross-validation suggested that CONC distinguished coding RNAs from ncRNAs at about 97% specificity and 98% sensitivity.

To obtain an accurate account of the repertoire of splice variants, and to gain insight into the mechanisms of alternative splicing, it is essential that cDNAs are very accurately mapped to their respective genomes. Currently available algorithms for cDNA-to-genome alignment do not reach the necessary level of accuracy because they use ad hoc scoring models that cannot correctly trade off the likelihoods of various sequencing errors against the probabilities of different gene structures. Here we develop a Bayesian probabilistic approach to cDNA-to-genome alignment. Gene structures are assigned prior probabilities based on the lengths of their introns and exons, and based on the sequences at their splice boundaries. A likelihood model for sequencing errors takes into account the rates at which misincorporation, as well as insertions and deletions of different lengths, occurs during sequencing. The parameters of both the prior and likelihood model can be automatically estimated from a set of cDNAs, thus enabling our method to adapt itself to different organisms and experimental procedures. We implemented our method in a fast cDNA-to-genome alignment program, SPA, and applied it to the FANTOM3 dataset of over 100,000 full-length mouse cDNAs and a dataset of over 20,000 full-length human cDNAs. Comparison with the results of four other mapping programs shows that SPA produces alignments of significantly higher quality. In particular, the quality of the SPA alignments near splice boundaries and SPA's mapping of the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the cDNAs are highly improved, allowing for more accurate identification of transcript starts and ends, and accurate identification of subtle splice variations. Finally, our splice boundary analysis on the human dataset suggests the existence of a novel non-canonical splice site that we also find in the mouse dataset.

Recent efforts at a large or a complete genomic scale have been conducted to search for positively selected genes in human and in chimp. However, recently developed methods allowing for a more sensitive and controlled approach in the detection of positive selection can be employed. Here, using 13,198 genes, we have deduced the sets of genes involved in rate acceleration, positive selection, and relaxation of selective constraints in human, in chimp, and in their ancestral lineage since the divergence from murids. Significant deviations from the strict molecular clock were observed in 469 human and in 651 chimp genes. The more stringent branch-site test of positive selection detected 108 human and 577 chimp positively selected genes. An important proportion of the positively selected genes did not show a significant acceleration in rates, and similarly, many of the accelerated genes did not show significant signals of positive selection. Functional differentiation of genes under rate acceleration, positive selection, and relaxation was not statistically significant between human and chimp with the exception of terms related to G-protein coupled receptors and sensory perception. Both of these were over-represented under relaxation in human in relation to chimp. Comparing differences between derived and ancestral lineages, a more conspicuous change in trends seems to have favored positive selection in the human lineage. Since most of the positively selected genes are different under the same functional categories between these species, we suggest that the individual roles of the alternative positively selected genes may be an important factor underlying biological differences between these species.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Positive_Selection_Relaxation_and_Acceleration_in_the_Evolution_of_the_Human_and_Chimp_Genome/152969', [u'Genetics', u'Biological Sciences', u'Evolutionary Biology'], []]

Clusters of genes distributed at localized genome positions have been reported in several eukaryotes. Various correlations have been observed between the expressions of genes in adjacent or nearby positions along the chromosomes depending on tissue type and developmental stage. Moreover, in several cases, their transcripts, which control epigenetic transcription via processes such as transcriptional interference and genomic imprinting, occur in clusters. It is reasonable that genomic regions that have similar mechanisms show similar expression patterns and that the characteristics of expression in the same genomic regions differ depending on tissue type and developmental stage. In this study, we analyzed gene expression patterns using the cap analysis gene expression (CAGE) method for exploring systematic views of the mouse transcriptome. Counting the number of mapped CAGE tags for fixed-length regions allowed us to determine genomic expression levels. These expression levels were normalized, quantified, and converted into four types of descriptors, allowing the expression patterns along the genome to be represented by character strings. We analyzed them using dynamic programming in the same manner as for sequence analysis. We have developed a novel algorithm that provides a novel view of the genome from the perspective of genomic positional expression.

Using optimized parameters for SAGE2Splice analysis and two sets of SAGE data, candidate junctions were discovered for 5%\u20136% of unmapped tags. Candidates were classified into three categories, reflecting the previous annotations of the putative splice junctions. Analysis of predicted tags extracted from EST sequences demonstrated that candidate junctions having the splice junction located closer to the center of the tags are more reliable. Nine of these 12 candidates were validated by RT-PCR and sequencing, and among these, four revealed previously uncharacterized exons. Thus, SAGE2Splice provides a new functionality for the identification of novel transcripts and exons.

To investigate the nature and significance of \u201cmasking\u201d this molecule, we characterized the mechanism of masking and consequences of unmasking for immune recognition. We found that the underlying \u03b2-glucan in the cell wall of Candida albicans is unmasked by subinhibitory doses of the antifungal drug caspofungin, causing the exposed fungi to elicit a stronger immune response. Using a library of bakers' yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) mutants, we uncovered a conserved genetic network that is required for concealing \u03b2-glucan from the immune system and limiting the host response. Perturbation of parts of this network in the pathogen C. albicans caused unmasking of its \u03b2-glucan, leading to increased \u03b2-glucan receptor-dependent elicitation of key proinflammatory cytokines from primary mouse macrophages. By creating an anti-inflammatory barrier to mask \u03b2-glucan, opportunistic fungi may promote commensal colonization and have an increased propensity for causing disease. Targeting the widely conserved gene network required for creating and maintaining this barrier may lead to novel broad-spectrum antimycotics.", u'https://figshare.com/articles/A_Drug_Sensitive_Genetic_Network_Masks_Fungi_from_the_Immune_System/153138', [u'Cancer', u'Microbiology', u'Immunology'], []]

Using an in vitro transcription/splicing assay, we demonstrate that an association of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription and pre-mRNA splicing is required for efficient gene expression. Pol II-synthesized RNAs containing functional splice sites are protected from nuclear degradation, presumably because the local concentration of the splicing machinery is sufficiently high to ensure its association over interactions with nucleases. Furthermore, the process of transcription influences alternative splicing of newly synthesized pre-mRNAs. Because other RNA polymerases do not provide similar protection from nucleases, and their RNA products display altered splicing patterns, the link between transcription and RNA processing is RNA Pol II-specific. We propose that the connection between transcription by Pol II and pre-mRNA splicing guarantees an extended half-life and proper processing of nascent pre-mRNAs.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Linking_Splicing_to_Pol_II_Transcription_Stabilizes_Pre_mRNAs_and_Influences_Splicing_Patterns/153499', [u'Biological Sciences', u'Biochemistry'], []]

The transcription factor SHORT-ROOT (SHR) is a critical component in a developmental pathway regulating both the specification of the root stem cell niche and the differentiation potential of a subset of stem cells in the Arabidopsis root. To obtain a comprehensive view of the SHR pathway, we used a statistical method called meta-analysis to combine the results of several microarray experiments measuring the changes in global expression profiles after modulating SHR activity. Meta-analysis was first used to identify the direct targets of SHR by combining results from an inducible form of SHR driven by its endogenous promoter, ectopic expression, followed by cell sorting and comparisons of mutant to wild-type roots. Eight putative direct targets of SHR were identified, all with expression patterns encompassing subsets of the native SHR expression domain. Further evidence for direct regulation by SHR came from binding of SHR in vivo to the promoter regions of four of the eight putative targets. A new role for SHR in the vascular cylinder was predicted from the expression pattern of several direct targets and confirmed with independent markers. The meta-analysis approach was then used to perform a global survey of the SHR indirect targets. Our analysis suggests that the SHR pathway regulates root development not only through a large transcription regulatory network but also through hormonal pathways and signaling pathways using receptor-like kinases. Taken together, our results not only identify the first nodes in the SHR pathway and a new function for SHR in the development of the vascular tissue but also reveal the global architecture of this developmental pathway.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Whole_Genome_Analysis_of_the_SHORT_ROOT_Developmental_Pathway_in_Arabidopsis_/153525', [u'Mathematics', u'Medicine', u'Developmental Biology', u'Cell Biology'], []]

The DFG motif is not flipped in crystal structures of inactive forms of the closely related Src kinases, and imatinib does not inhibit c-Src. We present a structure of the kinase domain of Abl, determined in complex with an ATP\u2013peptide conjugate, in which the protein adopts an inactive conformation that resembles closely that of the Src kinases. An interesting aspect of the Src-like inactive structure, suggested by molecular dynamics simulations and additional crystal structures, is the presence of features that might facilitate the flip of the DFG motif by providing room for the phenylalanine to move and by coordinating the aspartate side chain as it leaves the active site. One class of mutations in BCR\u2013Abl that confers resistance to imatinib appears more likely to destabilize the inactive Src-like conformation than the active or imatinib-bound conformations.

The data were also used to test whether patterns of LD can predict hot spot locations. These sperm typing studies focused on several small regions of the genome already known or suspected of containing a hot spot based on the presence of LD breakdown or previous experimental evidence of hot spot activity. Comparable data on target regions not specifically chosen using these two criteria is lacking but is needed to make an unbiased test of whether LD data alone can accurately predict active hot spots. We used sperm typing to estimate recombination in 17 almost contiguous ~5 kb intervals spanning 103 kb of human Chromosome 21. We found two intervals that contained new hot spots. The comparison of our data with recombination rates predicted by statistical analyses of LD showed that, overall, the two datasets corresponded well, except for one predicted hot spot that showed little crossing over. This study doubles the experimental data on recombination in men at the highest resolution and accuracy and supports the emerging genome-wide picture that recombination is localized in small regions separated by cold areas. Detailed study of one of the new hot spots revealed a sperm donor with a decrease in recombination intensity at the canonical recombination site but an increase in crossover activity nearby. This unique finding suggests that the position and intensity of hot spots may evolve by means of a concerted mechanism that maintains the overall recombination intensity in the region.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/High_Resolution_Recombination_Patterns_in_a_Region_of_Human_Chromosome_21_Measured_by_Sperm_Typing/153014', [u'Genetics'], []]

This multi-subunit complex consists of ten polypeptides, including the recently identified small 8-kDa trichothiodystrophy group A (TTDA)/ hTFB5 protein. Patients belonging to the rare neurodevelopmental repair syndrome TTD-A carry inactivating mutations in the TTDA/hTFB5 gene. One of these mutations completely inactivates the protein, whereas other TFIIH genes only tolerate point mutations that do not compromise the essential role in transcription. Nevertheless, the severe NER-deficiency in TTD-A suggests that the TTDA protein is critical for repair. Using a fluorescently tagged and biologically active version of TTDA, we have investigated the involvement of TTDA in repair and transcription in living cells. Under non-challenging conditions, TTDA is present in two distinct kinetic pools: one bound to TFIIH, and a free fraction that shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus. After induction of NER-specific DNA lesions, the equilibrium between these two pools dramatically shifts towards a more stable association of TTDA to TFIIH. Modulating transcriptional activity in cells did not induce a similar shift in this equilibrium. Surprisingly, DNA conformations that only provoke an abortive-type of NER reaction do not result into a more stable incorporation of TTDA into TFIIH. These findings identify TTDA as the first TFIIH subunit with a primarily NER-dedicated role in vivo and indicate that its interaction with TFIIH reflects productive NER.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Dynamic_Interaction_of_TTDA_with_TFIIH_Is_Stabilized_by_Nucleotide_Excision_Repair_in_Living_Cells/153458', [u'Molecular Biology', u'Cell Biology', u'Genetics'], []]

The insensitivity of phagocytosis to brefeldin A (BFA), an inhibitor of certain ARF guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), previously indicated that ARF1 did not participate in phagocytosis. In this study, we show that ARF1 was activated during Fc\u03b3R-mediated phagocytosis and that blocking normal ARF1 cycling inhibited phagosome closure. We examined the distributions and activation patterns of ARF6 and ARF1 during Fc\u03b3R-mediated phagocytosis using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) stoichiometric microscopy of macrophages expressing CFP- or YFP-chimeras of ARF1, ARF6, and a GTP-ARF-binding protein domain. Both GTPases were activated by BFA-insensitive factors at sites of phagocytosis. ARF6 activation was restricted to the leading edge of the phagocytic cup, while ARF1 activation was delayed and delocalized over the phagosome. Phagocytic cups formed after inhibition of PI 3-kinase (PI-3K) contained persistently activated ARF6 and minimally activated ARF1. This indicates that a PI-3K-dependent signal transition defines the sequence of ARF GTPase activation during phagocytosis and that ARF6 and ARF1 coordinate different functions at the forming phagosome.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/A_Phosphatidylinositol_3_Kinase_Dependent_Signal_Transition_Regulates_ARF1_and_ARF6_during_Fc_Receptor_Mediated_Phagocytosis/153535', [u'Cell Biology', u'Immunology'], []]

Of some 40 genes regulated by USF1, several are involved in the molecular pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although the USF1 gene has been shown to have a critical role in the etiology of familial combined hyperlipidemia, which predisposes to early CVD, the gene's potential role as a risk factor for CVD events at the population level has not been established. Here we report the results from a prospective genetic\u2013epidemiological study of the association between the USF1 variants, CVD, and mortality in two large Finnish cohorts. Haplotype-tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms exposing all common allelic variants of USF1 were genotyped in a prospective case-cohort design with two distinct cohorts followed up during 1992\u20132001 and 1997\u20132003. The total number of follow-up years was 112,435 in 14,140 individuals, of which 2,225 were selected for genotyping based on the case-cohort study strategy. After adjustment for conventional risk factors, we observed an association of USF1 with CVD and mortality among females. In combined analysis of the two cohorts, female carriers of a USF1 risk haplotype had a 2-fold risk of a CVD event (hazard ratio [HR] 2.02; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.16\u20133.53; p = 0.01) and an increased risk of all-cause mortality (HR 2.52; 95% CI 1.46\u20134.35; p = 0.0009). A putative protective haplotype of USF1 was also identified. Our study shows how a gene identified in exceptional families proves to be important also at the population level, implying that allelic variants of USF1 significantly influence the prospective risk of CVD and even all-cause mortality in females.", u'https://figshare.com/articles/Risk_Alleles_of_USF1_Gene_Predict_Cardiovascular_Disease_of_Women_in_Two_Prospective_Studies/152933', [u'Genetics', u'Biotechnology'], []]

Identification of these regions usually relies on genotyping tumor and counterpart normal DNA and noting regions where heterozygous alleles in the normal DNA become homozygous in the tumor. However, paired normal samples for tumors and cell lines are often not available. With the advent of oligonucleotide arrays that simultaneously assay thousands of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, genotyping can now be done at high enough resolution to allow identification of LOH events by the absence of heterozygous loci, without comparison to normal controls. Here we describe a hidden Markov model-based method to identify LOH from unpaired tumor samples, taking into account SNP intermarker distances, SNP-specific heterozygosity rates, and the haplotype structure of the human genome. When we applied the method to data genotyped on 100 K arrays, we correctly identified 99% of SNP markers as either retention or loss. We also correctly identified 81% of the regions of LOH, including 98% of regions greater than 3 megabases. By integrating copy number analysis into the method, we were able to distinguish LOH from allelic imbalance. Application of this method to data from a set of prostate samples without paired normals identified known regions of prevalent LOH. We have developed a method for analyzing high-density oligonucleotide SNP array data to accurately identify of regions of LOH and retention in tumors without the need for paired normal samples.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Inferring_Loss_of_Heterozygosity_from_Unpaired_Tumors_Using_High_Density_Oligonucleotide_SNP_Arrays/152937', [u'Biotechnology', u'Biological Sciences', u'Cancer'], []]

If a microRNA (miRNA) target is present in the UTR, then only those target-containing isoforms should be sensitive to control by a cognate miRNA. We carried out a systematic examination of 3\u2032 UTRs containing multiple poly(A) sites and putative miRNA targets. Based on expressed sequence tag (EST) counts and EST library information, we observed that levels of isoforms containing targets for miR-1 or miR-124, two miRNAs causing downregulation of transcript levels, were reduced in tissues expressing the corresponding miRNA. This analysis was repeated for all conserved 7-mers in 3\u2032 UTRs, resulting in a selection of 312 motifs. We show that this set is significantly enriched in known miRNA targets and mRNA-destabilizing elements, which validates our initial hypothesis. We scanned the human genome for possible cognate miRNAs and identified phylogenetically conserved precursors matching our motifs.

By profiling normalized abundances (AN) of basic regulatory patterns of individual THubs in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcriptional regulation network under five different cellular states and environmental conditions, we have investigated their preferences for different basic regulatory patterns. Subgraph-normalized abundances downstream of individual THubs often differ significantly from that of the network as a whole, and conversely, certain over-represented subgraphs are not preferred by any THub. The THub preferences changed substantially when the cellular or environmental conditions changed. This switching of regulatory pattern preferences suggests that a change in conditions does not only elicit a change in response by the regulatory network, but also a change in the mechanisms by which the response is mediated. The THub subgraph preference profile thus provides a novel tool for description of the structure and organization between the large-scale exponents and local regulatory patterns.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Dynamic_Changes_in_Subgraph_Preference_Profiles_of_Crucial_Transcription_Factors/152964', [u'Biological Sciences', u'Medicine'], []]

Evidence suggests that cell surface proteins are not as freely diffusible as implied by the classic fluid mosaic model and that their confinement to membrane domains is regulated. It is unknown whether these dynamic localization mechanisms function to enhance signal transduction activation rate or to minimize cross talk among pathways that share common intermediates. To determine which of these two possibilities is more likely, we derive an explicit equation for the rate at which cell surface membrane proteins interact based on a Brownian motion model in the presence of endocytosis and exocytosis. We find that in the absence of any diffusion constraints, cell surface protein interaction rate is extremely high relative to cytoplasmic protein interaction rate even in a large mammalian cell with a receptor abundance of a mere two hundred molecules. Since a larger number of downstream signaling events needs to take place, each occurring at a much slower rate than the initial activation via association of cell surface proteins, we conclude that the role of co-localization is most likely that of cross-talk reduction rather than coupling efficiency enhancement.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Spatial_Regulation_and_the_Rate_of_Signal_Transduction_Activation/152999', [u'Cancer', u'Biological Sciences', u'Cell Biology', u'Developmental Biology', u'Biochemistry'], []]

Receptors of the mammalian innate immune system play an essential role in the detection of infected or transformed cells and are vital for the initiation and regulation of a full adaptive immune response. The genes for several of these receptors are clustered within the leukocyte receptor complex (LRC). The purpose of this study was to carry out a detailed analysis of the chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) LRC. Bacterial artificial chromosomes containing genes related to mammalian leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptors were identified in a chicken genomic library and shown to map to a single microchromosome. Sequencing revealed 103 chicken immunoglobulin-like receptor (CHIR) loci (22 inhibitory, 25 activating, 15 bifunctional, and 41 pseudogenes). A very complex splicing pattern was found using transcript analyses and seven hypervariable regions were detected in the external CHIR domains. Phylogenetic and genomic analysis showed that CHIR genes evolved mainly by block duplications from an ancestral inhibitory receptor locus, with transformation into activating receptors occurring more than once. Evolutionary selection pressure has led not only to an exceptional expansion of the CHIR cluster but also to a dramatic diversification of CHIR loci and haplotypes. This indicates that CHIRs have the potential to complement the adaptive immune system in fighting pathogens.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/The_Leukocyte_Receptor_Complex_in_Chicken_Is_Characterized_by_Massive_Expansion_and_Diversification_of_Immunoglobulin_Like_Loci/153121', [u'Genetics', u'Immunology', u'Molecular Biology', u'Evolutionary Biology'], []]

Specifically, we use our approach to fit models using a smooth nonlinear formalism for modeling gene regulation (gene circuits) as well as models using logical rules based on activation and repression thresholds for transcription factors. Our technique also allows us to infer regulatory relationships de novo or to test network structures suggested by the literature. We fit a series of models to test several outstanding questions about gap gene regulation, including regulation of and by hunchback and the role of autoactivation. Based on our modeling results and validation against the experimental literature, we propose a revised network structure for the gap gene system.

Given the physical and logical complexity of these networks, the various sources of (often noisy) data that can be utilized for their elucidation, the monetary costs involved, and the huge number of potential experiments (~1012) that can be performed, experiment design algorithms will be necessary for synthesizing the various computational and experimental data to maximize the efficiency of regulatory network reconstruction. This paper presents an algorithm for experimental design to systematically and efficiently reconstruct transcriptional regulatory networks. It is meant to be applied iteratively in conjunction with an experimental laboratory component. The algorithm is presented here in the context of reconstructing transcriptional regulation for metabolism in Escherichia coli, and, through a retrospective analysis with previously performed experiments, we show that the produced experiment designs conform to how a human would design experiments. The algorithm is able to utilize probability estimates based on a wide range of computational and experimental sources to suggest experiments with the highest potential of discovering the greatest amount of new regulatory knowledge.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Iterative_Reconstruction_of_Transcriptional_Regulatory_Networks_An_Algorithmic_Approach/153024', [u'Biological Sciences', u'Biotechnology', u'Medicine', u'Microbiology'], []]

Mutations in Drosophila DNA damage response genes such as atm/tefu, mre11, or rad50 disrupt telomere protection and localization of the telomere-associated proteins HP1 and HOAP, suggesting that recognition of chromosome ends contributes to telomere protection. However, the partial telomere protection phenotype of these mutations limits the ability to test if they act in the epigenetic telomere protection mechanism. We examined the roles of the Drosophila atm and atr-atrip DNA damage response pathways and the nbs homolog in DNA damage responses and telomere protection. As in other organisms, the atm and atr-atrip pathways act in parallel to promote telomere protection. Cells lacking both pathways exhibit severe defects in telomere protection and fail to localize the protection protein HOAP to telomeres. Drosophila nbs is required for both atm- and atr-dependent DNA damage responses and acts in these pathways during DNA repair. The telomere fusion phenotype of nbs is consistent with defects in each of these activities. Cells defective in both the atm and atr pathways were used to examine if DNA damage response pathways regulate telomere protection without affecting telomere specific sequences. In these cells, chromosome fusion sites retain telomere-specific sequences, demonstrating that loss of these sequences is not responsible for loss of protection. Furthermore, terminally deleted chromosomes also fuse in these cells, directly implicating DNA damage response pathways in the epigenetic protection of telomeres. We propose that recognition of chromosome ends and recruitment of HP1 and HOAP by DNA damage response proteins is essential for the epigenetic protection of Drosophila telomeres. Given the conserved roles of DNA damage response proteins in telomere function, related mechanisms may act at the telomeres of other organisms.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Epigenetic_Telomere_Protection_by_Drosophila_DNA_Damage_Response_Pathways/153040', [u'Genetics'], []]

Although important, the absolute requirement for MHC Class Ia\u2013dependent CD8 T cells for control of chronic virus infection has not been formally demonstrated. We show here that mice lacking MHC Class Ia molecules (Kb\u2212/\u2212xDb\u2212/\u2212 mice) effectively control chronic \u03b3-herpesvirus 68 (\u03b3HV68) infection via a robust expansion of \u03b22-microglobulin (\u03b22-m)-dependent, but CD1d-independent, unconventional CD8 T cells. These unconventional CD8 T cells expressed: (1) CD8\u03b1\u03b2 and CD3, (2) cell surface molecules associated with conventional effector/memory CD8 T cells, (3) TCR\u03b1\u03b2 with a significant V\u03b24, V\u03b23, and V\u03b210 bias, and (4) the key effector cytokine interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3). Unconventional CD8 T cells utilized a diverse TCR repertoire, and CDR3 analysis suggests that some of that repertoire may be utilized even in the presence of conventional CD8 T cells. This is the first demonstration to our knowledge that \u03b22-m\u2013dependent, but Class Ia\u2013independent, unconventional CD8 T cells can efficiently control chronic virus infection, implicating a role for \u03b22-n\u2013dependent non-classical MHC molecules in control of chronic viral infection.

Here we demonstrate that within a timescale of minutes, two distinct fast-acting processes drive motor adaptation. One process responds weakly to error but retains information well, whereas the other responds strongly but has poor retention. This two-state learning system makes the surprising prediction of spontaneous recovery (or adaptation rebound) if error feedback is clamped at zero following an adaptation-extinction training episode. We used a novel paradigm to experimentally confirm this prediction in human motor learning of reaching, and we show that the interaction between the learning processes in this simple two-state system provides a unifying explanation for several different, apparently unrelated, phenomena in motor adaptation including savings, anterograde interference, spontaneous recovery, and rapid unlearning. Our results suggest that motor adaptation depends on at least two distinct neural systems that have different sensitivity to error and retain information at different rates.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Interacting_Adaptive_Processes_with_Different_Timescales_Underlie_Short_Term_Motor_Learning/153418', [u'Neuroscience'], []]

In the mouse, Fgf9 and Wnt4 are expressed in gonads of both sexes prior to sex determination. Loss of Fgf9 leads to XY sex reversal, whereas loss of Wnt4 results in partial testis development in XX gonads. However, the relationship between these signals and the male sex-determining gene, Sry, was unknown. We show through gain- and loss-of-function experiments that fibroblast growth factor 9 (FGF9) and WNT4 act as opposing signals to regulate sex determination. In the mouse XY gonad, Sry normally initiates a feed-forward loop between Sox9 and Fgf9, which up-regulates Fgf9 and represses Wnt4 to establish the testis pathway. Surprisingly, loss of Wnt4 in XX gonads is sufficient to up-regulate Fgf9 and Sox9 in the absence of Sry. These data suggest that the fate of the gonad is controlled by antagonism between Fgf9 and Wnt4. The role of the male sex-determining switch\u2014 Sry in the case of mammals\u2014is to tip the balance between these underlying patterning signals. In principle, sex determination in other vertebrates may operate through any switch that introduces an imbalance between these two signaling pathways.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/_Fgf9_and_Wnt4_Act_as_Antagonistic_Signals_to_Regulate_Mammalian_Sex_Determination_/153445', [u'Cell Biology', u'Developmental Biology'], []]

In the present work, we directly compared the expression of GC-rich and GC-poor genes placed in the context of identical promoters and UTR sequences. We performed transient and stable transfections of mammalian cells with GC-rich and GC-poor versions of Hsp70, green fluorescent protein, and IL2 genes. The GC-rich genes were expressed several-fold to over a 100-fold more efficiently than their GC-poor counterparts. This effect was not due to different translation rates of GC-rich and GC-poor mRNA. On the contrary, the efficient expression of GC-rich genes resulted from their increased steady-state mRNA levels. mRNA degradation rates were not correlated with GC content, suggesting that efficient transcription or mRNA processing is responsible for the high expression of GC-rich genes.

Mechanical properties, densities, and detonation velocities of the cocrystals in different ratios were estimated. The intermolecular interactions and bond dissociation energies (BDEs) of the N\u2013NO2 bond in the HMX:FOX-7 (1:1) complex were calculated using the B3LYP and MP2(full) methods at the 6\u2013311++G (d,p) and 6\u2013311++G(2df,2p) basis sets. Solvent effects on stability are discussed. The results indicate that HMX/FOX-7 cocrystals prefer cocrystalizing in a 1:1 molar ratio, which has good mechanical properties. The N\u2013NO2 bond becomes strong upon the formation of a complex and the sensitivity of HMX might decrease in cocrystals. The sensitivity change of HMX/FOX-7 originates from not only the formation of intermolecular interaction but also the increment in the N\u2013NO2 BDE. HMX/FOX-7 cocrystals exhibit good detonation performance and meet the requirements of high-density energetic materials.

Ordovician intrusive rocks exposed in the XMOB, from north to south, are the Abaga-East Ujimqin Qi-Duobaoshan belt, the Sonid Zuoqi-West Ujimqin Qi belt, and the Damaoqi-Baimaimiao-Tulinkai belt, respectively. Zircon U\u2013Pb dating and geochemical data are presented for the intrusive rocks in East Ujimqin Qi and West Ujimqin Qi, Inner Mongolia. The intrusive rocks from East Ujimqin Qi consist of gabbro, diorite, and granodiorite. LA-MC-ICP-MS zircon U\u2013Pb ages range 446 to 461\xa0Ma. Geochemical data suggest that the gabbros and diorites from East Ujimqin are a tholeiitic series, both of arc-related and N-MORB (mid-ocean ridge basalt) signature, indicating a back-arc basin setting. The granodiorites have a shoshonitic series and arc-related signature. Rare earth element (REE) patterns and trace element characteristics suggest gabbros, diorites, and granodiorites are petrogenetically correlated. These intrusive rocks from East Ujimqin Qi have high light REE, Th, and U concentrations, suggesting the effect of middle\u2013upper continental crustal contamination. Major oxides display positive or negative correlations, with increasing MgO or SiO2, indicating that fractional crystallization occurred during magma evolution. Geochemical data of diorite from West Ujimqin Qi indicate a tholeiitic series, arc-related signature. Zircon U\u2013Pb dating yielded an age of 441.8\xa0\xb1\xa01.5\xa0Ma. Integrated with the regionally exposed Mid\u2013Late Ordovician plutons and metasedimentary strata, we concluded that the northward subduction of the Palaeo-Asian Ocean (PAO) that occurred beneath the southern margin of the South Mongolian Micro-continent along the Sonid Zuoqi-Xilinhot gave rise to early Palaeozoic igneous rocks from the Abaga\u2013East Ujimqin Qi\u2013Duobaoshan and the Sonid Zuoqi\u2013West Ujimqin Qi belts.

The Sanchakou intrusions situated in Eastern Tianshan (southern CAOB), are mainly quartz diorite and granodiorite. A comprehensive study of zircon U\u2013Pb ages, zircon trace elements, whole-rock geochemistry, and Lu\u2013Hf isotopes were carried out for the Sanchakou intrusive rocks. LA-ICP-MS zircon U\u2013Pb dating yielded crystallization ages of 439.7\xa0\xb1\xa02.5\xa0Ma (MSWD\xa0=\xa00.63, n\xa0=\xa021) for the quartz diorite, and 430.9\xa0\xb1\xa02.5\xa0Ma (MSWD\xa0=\xa00.21, n\xa0=\xa021) and 425.5\xa0\xb1\xa02.7\xa0Ma (MSWD\xa0=\xa00.04; n\xa0=\xa020) for the granodiorites. These data, in combination with other Silurian ages reported for the intrusive suites from Eastern Tianshan, indicate an early Palaeozoic magmatic event in the orogen. In situ zircon Hf isotope data for the Sanchakou quartz diorite shows \u03b5Hf(t) values of +11.2 to +19.6, and the two granodioritic samples exhibit similar \u03b5Hf(t) values from +13.0 to +19.5. The Sanchakou plutons show metaluminous to weakly peraluminous, arc-type geochemical and low-K tholeiite affinities, and display trace element patterns characterized by enrichment in K, Ba, Sr, and Sm, and depletion in Nb, Ta, Pb, and Ti. The geochemical and isotopic signatures indicate that the Sanchakou dioritic and granodioritic magmas were sourced from a subducted oceanic slab, and subsequently underwent some interaction with peridotite in the mantle wedge. Combined with the regional geological history, we suggest the Sanchakou intrusions formed due to the northward subduction of the Palaeo-Tianshan Ocean beneath the Dananhu\u2013Tousuquan arc during early Silurian time.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Petrogenesis_of_early_Silurian_intrusions_in_the_Sanchakou_area_of_Eastern_Tianshan_Northwest_China_and_tectonic_implications_geochronological_geochemical_and_Hf_isotopic_evidence/2807758', [u'Biochemistry', u'Environmental Sciences', u'Chemical Sciences', u'Inorganic Chemistry'], []]

Compared with the adjacent granitoids of the ranges, the redbeds of the basins have not been well characterized. In this article, provenance, source weathering, and tectonic setting of the redbeds are investigated by petrographic and geochemical studies of sandstone samples from the Late Cretaceous Guifeng Group of the Yongchong Basin in the Gan-Hang Belt, southeast China. Detrital grains are commonly subangular to subrounded, poorly sorted, and are rich in lithic fragments. The variable pre-metasomatic Chemical Index of Alternation (CIA*\xa0=\xa062\u201385), Chemical Index of Weathering (CIW\xa0=\xa070.90\u201398.76, avg. 85.62), Plagioclase Index of Alteration (PIA\xa0=\xa060.23\u201398.35, avg. 79.91), and high Index of Compositional Variability (ICV\xa0=\xa00.67\u20133.08, avg. 1.40) values collectively suggest an overall intermediate degree of chemical weathering and intense physical erosion of the source rocks, but a relatively decreased degree of chemical weathering during the late stage (Lianhe Formation) of the Guifeng Group is observed. Several chemical ratios (e.g. Al2O3/TiO2, La/Th, Cr/Th, Th/Sc, Zr/Sc) also suggest a dominant felsic source nature, significant first-cycle sediment supply, and low sedimentary recycling. Such features are consistent with active extension tectonic setting. Sandstone framework models and geochemical characteristics suggest the provenance is related to passive margin (PM), active continental margin (ACM), and continental island arc (CIA) tectonic settings. Sediment derivation from the Neoproterozoic metamorphic rocks and Silurian\u2013Devonian granites indicates a PM provenance, whereas sediments derived from the Early Cretaceous volcanic-intrusive complexes suggest an ACM and CIA nature. Therefore, the Late Cretaceous redbeds were deposited in a dustpan-like half-graben under the back-arc extension regime when southeast China was possibly influenced by northwestward subduction of the Palaeo-Pacific plate beneath East Asia.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Petrography_and_geochemistry_of_the_Late_Cretaceous_redbeds_in_the_Gan_Hang_Belt_southeast_China_implications_for_provenance_source_weathering_and_tectonic_setting/3100162', [u'Biochemistry', u'Environmental Sciences', u'Chemical Sciences', u'Ecology', u'Sociology', u'Biological Sciences'], []]

Correlatable sections recording the event exhibit very similar lithological characters, positive-then-negative C isotope excursions and massive biotic demise. Detailed analyses of the fossil record and carbon isotopic variations were carried out on the Guadalupian\u2013Wuchiapingian Boundary sections over the inner, middle, outer zones of the ELIP and its margin. Due to a pronounced decrease in marine habitat area and the environmental and ecological change over this part of the Tethys, the biota crisis records show the loss of numerous tropical invertebrate taxa, and exhibit fewer genera and smaller testing sizes and low productivity. The biota crisis was a sustainable and gradual reduction in diversity over the Capitanian. The associated carbon isotopic data reveal unusually high \u03b413C(carb) values before the late Capitanian, representing higher primary productivity (or buried rate) and more 13C-enriched CO2 released by hydrothermal carbonate breakdown from the upper crust into the sediments at that time. Subsequently, an accelerated negative excursion across the boundary and the gradual excursion with low carbon isotope amplitude favours an increased influx of light 12C sourced by the volcanism around the eastern Tethys. The very similar time\u2013space relation between the biota crisis and the Emeishan volcanism confirms that volcanic eruptions may have triggered the biota crisis event in South China. Intensive volcanism could result in detrimental environmental and ecological stresses, habitat loss, organic material splitting, or the emission of light carbon and thermal fluid (or aerosol), implying that the losses of the shallow-marine invertebrates either occurred geologically instantaneously or in a series of closely spaced crises coinciding with the initial phase of ELIP formation.

In this article, we compile geochemical data for blueschist and eclogite facies rocks from global palaeo-subduction-zones in the literature, including those from the Chinese Western Tianshan ultrahigh pressure (UHP) metamorphic belt. We synthesize our up-to-date understanding on how chemical elements behave and their controls during subduction-zone metamorphism. Although the compositional heterogeneity of metamorphic minerals from subducted rocks has been recently reported, we emphasize that the mineral compositional heterogeneity is controlled by elemental availability during mineral growth, which is affected by the protolith composition, the inherited composition of precursor minerals, and the competition with neighbouring growing minerals. In addition, given the likely effects of varying protolith compositions and metamorphic conditions on elemental behaviours, we classify meta-mafic rocks from global palaeo-subduction-zones with varying metamorphic conditions into groups in terms of their protolith compositions (i.e. ocean island basalt (OIB)-like, enriched mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB)-like, normal [N]-MORB-like), and discuss geochemical behaviours of chemical elements within these co-genetic groups rather than simply accepting the conclusions in the literature. We also discuss the geochemical consequences of SZM with implications for chemical geodynamics, and propose with emphasis that: (1) the traditionally accepted \u2018fluid flux induced-melting\u2019 model for arc magmatism requires revision; and (2) the residual subducted ocean crust cannot be the major source material for OIB, although it can contribute to the deep mantle compositional heterogeneity.

However, due to complex intracontinental deformation and abundant magmatism, there are serious divergences in the corresponding records of the tectonic transformation from Palaeo-Tethys to Palaeo-Pacific. We have analysed the map-scale superimposed fold system developed in central SCB and also inverted the palaeo-stress field based on the fault\u2013slip vectors. On this basis, the deformation styles and superposition mechanism of two-stage folds were recovered to establish the tectonic stress field in early Mesozoic and tectono-magmatic events by combining the chronology of the accompanying syntectonic magma. The early E\u2013W/WNW-trending folds and Triassic magmatic system were identified; these were controlled by the NE\u2013SW-trending compressive stress field, to coordinate with the collisions between the SCB and the Indochina block in the southwest, and the North China block in the north. The late NE/NNE-trending folds superimposed on the early folds in an orthogonal way to form a large-scale dome-basin superimposed fold system, which were controlled by the WNW\u2013ESE-trending compressive stress field. According to the strata relations involved in deformation and the chronology data of magmatic rocks, it could be determined that NE/ENE-trending folds would be formed during the Mid- to Late Jurassic, corresponding to the westward subduction events of the Palaeo-Pacific plate. The establishment of the large-scale superimposed fold styles and the identification of fold deformation in the Triassic and Jurassic are important for understanding the early Mesozoic tectonics of South China, and even for all East Asia continent.

Whole rock Sr\u2013Nd\u2013Pb isotopic compositions of these granitoids are similar (initial 87Sr/86Sr\xa0=\xa00.70404 to 0.70554; \u03b5Nd(t)\xa0= \u20130.9 to 2.4; (206Pb/204Pb)t\xa0=\xa015.549\u201315.567, (207Pb/204Pb)t\xa0=\xa018.035\u201318.530, (208Pb/204Pb)t\xa0=\xa037.966\u201338.229) and altogether suggest that the magmas from which the Mo deposits were generated originated from the mantle or juvenile crust. Combining our results with regional Jurassic tectonic setting, we conclude that the mineralization of these granitoids reflected Pacific plate subduction which induced magma underplating and promoted the remelting of the juvenile crust, resulting in voluminous granitic magma.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Ore_forming_granites_from_Jurassic_porphyry_Mo_deposits_east_central_Jilin_Province_China_geochemistry_geochronology_and_petrogenesis/2556007', [u'Biophysics', u'Cell Biology', u'Physiology', u'Pharmacology', u'Biotechnology', u'Geology', u'Chemical Sciences', u'Ecology', u'Developmental Biology', u'Cancer'], []]

Meneses-Rocha', 'Natalia Pavlinova', 'Alejandro Rodriguez-Trejo'], u'2016-02-22T07:39:42Z', u'This article reports single-grain multi-elemental results (Sr, Y, Th, U, and rare earth elements) obtained in 966 apatites from 18 rocks (sandstones and granitoids) that were sampled from the Mesozoic (Todos Santos and San Ricardo Formations) and Eocene (the El Bosque Formation) successions as well as from the Permian\u2013Triassic Chiapas Massif Complex (CMC), all of which are exposed within the Sierra de Chiapas (SCH), SE Mexico. The objectives of the present study are (1) to establish changes in provenance between the Mesozoic and Eocene sedimentary sequences using single-grain apatite geochemistry, and (2) to identify source areas for siliciclastic materials from the Todos Santos, San Ricardo, and the El Bosque Formations. The results of the present work strongly suggest that apatites from the Todos Santos and San Ricardo Formations were mainly derived from intermediate to felsic I-type granitoids as well as from arc-related volcanic rocks, indicating that the CMC basement was the most important source area for the Mesozoic sandstones in the SCH. An abrupt change in provenance from Mesozoic to Eocene units was identified based on single-grain apatite geochemistry. Detrital apatites of the Ypresian\u2013Lutetian El Bosque Formation were derived from diverse source rocks such as mafic\u2013ultramafic rocks, intermediate to felsic I-type plutons, strongly fractionated S-type granites and pegmatites, as well as from different metamorphic source lithologies (including high-pressure rocks) such as gneisses, migmatites, metapelites, and/or eclogites. It was proposed, therefore, that most Eocene sediments of the SCH were derived from the Guatemala Suture Complex, which involves all the rock types mentioned above. A minor portion of the El Bosque Formation sediments was derived from the CMC area and/or from recycled sandstones from the Mesozoic Todos Santos and San Ricardo Formations.

Cambrian granitic gneiss crops out in the Duguer area of the South Qiangtang terrane in northern Tibet and yields zircon laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) U\u2013Pb ages of 502\u2013492\xa0Ma, providing insight into the possible existence of basement rocks within the South Qiangtang terrane. The granitic gneisses are geochemically similar to high-K, calc-alkaline S-type granites, and Hf isotopic analysis of zircons within the gneisses yields negative \u03b5Hf(t) values (\u20137.4 to \u2013 1.1) and old zircon Hf model ages (TDMC\xa0=\xa01757\u20131406\xa0Ma). These granitic gneisses were generated by partial melting of ancient pelitic rocks, and the resulting melts were contaminated by a small amount of mantle-derived material. Combining our new data with previous research, we conclude that these Cambrian granitic gneisses developed in a post-collisional tectonic setting after Pan-African tectonism.

We investigate the effect of structure and concentration of surfactants on the anchoring of NLC 4-cyano-4\u2032-pentylbiphenyl (5CB) at 5CB\u2013solid interface. 5CB molecules undergo an ordering transition from parallel to normal anchoring near the surfactant critical micelle concentration depending on the chemical structure of the surfactant tails. In contrast to the previous studies which point to the solubilization of 5CB in surfactant micelles, our experiments indicate that NLC anchoring transition occurs due to the ability of 5CB molecules to penetrate into the surface surfactant layer. The surfactant-driven 5CB anchoring is further related to the surface tension of 5CB (\u03b35CB), surfactant adsorbed substrate surface energy (\u03b3sa), anisotropic 5CB\u2013surface interfacial energy (\u0394\u03b3sl), and spreading coefficient (S). Our experimental results agree with the Creagh\u2013Kahn criterion of predicting surface anchoring from relative values of \u03b3sa and \u03b35CB. A change in the sign of \u0394\u03b3sl and S is also observed along with the anchoring transition.

A better characterization of biofilms in membrane systems and their impact on membrane performance may help to develop effective biofouling control strategies. The objective of this study was to determine the occurrence, extent and timescale of biofilm compaction and relaxation (decompaction), caused by permeate flux variations. The impact of permeate flux changes on biofilm thickness, structure and stiffness was investigated in situ and non-destructively with optical coherence tomography using membrane fouling monitors operated at a constant crossflow velocity of 0.1\xa0m\xa0s\u22121 with permeate production. The permeate flux was varied sequentially from 20 to 60 and back to 20\xa0L\xa0m\u22122\xa0h\u22121. The study showed that the average biofilm thickness on the membrane decreased after elevating the permeate flux from 20 to 60\xa0L\xa0m\u22122\xa0h\u22121 while the biofilm thickness increased again after restoring the original flux of 20\xa0L\xa0m\u22122\xa0h\u22121, indicating the occurrence of biofilm compaction and relaxation. Within a few seconds after the flux change, the biofilm thickness was changed and stabilized, biofilm compaction occurred faster than the relaxation after restoring the original permeate flux. The initial biofilm parameters were not fully reinstated: the biofilm thickness was reduced by 21%, biofilm stiffness had increased and the hydraulic biofilm resistance was elevated by 16%. Biofilm thickness was related to the hydraulic biofilm resistance. Membrane performance losses are related to the biofilm thickness, density and morphology, which are influenced by (variations in) hydraulic conditions. A (temporarily) permeate flux increase caused biofilm compaction, together with membrane performance losses.

This study demonstrated that the toxicity of IONPs was mainly contributed by the indirect light shading effect from the suspending nanoparticles which is nanoparticles concentration-dependent, direct light shading effect caused by the attachment of IONPs on cell and the cell aggregation, and the oxidative stress from the internalization of IONPs into the cells. The results showed that the layer of poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) tended to mask the IONPs and hence eliminated oxidative stress toward the protein yield but it in turn tended to enhance the toxicity of IONPs by enabling the IONPs to attach on cell surfaces and cause cell aggregation.

In the present study, we analyse the long-term development of ZD patients\u2019 symptoms after successful endoscopic mucomyotomy, as well as interventional safety, sustainability of success, and predisposing factors for clinical recurrence. Methods Forty-six consecutive patients (54% male, mean age 67 years) with symptomatic ZD were treated using a hook knife and soft diverticuloscope. Follow-up interviews at 1 and 6 months inquired about a broad pool of symptoms and the dysphagia score. For further analysis, patients were retrospectively stratified into a \u2018recurrence\u2019 and \u2018no recurrence\u2019 group. Results After 100% initial success, 30% of patients reported recurrence of symptoms after 4.4 months (range 1-40) and were re-treated (mean 1.39 sessions/patient). Though the \u2018recurrence\u2019 group showed a higher dysphagia score and frequency past intervention, endoscopic re-treatment achieved equally good results as in the \u2018no recurrence\u2019 group. Before treatment, \u2018recurrence\u2019 patients had more severe symptoms, such as vomiting (frequency score 2.13 vs. 0.92; p\u2009<\u20090.05), ZD-related insomnia (1.65 vs. 1.08, n.s.), and a higher dysphagia score (2.25 vs. 1.59, n.s.).

Regardless of changes in temperature, higher operating pressures enhanced both permeate flux and salt rejection, while effects of temperatures on performance varied depending on the operating pressures. Increasing temperatures to less than 35\xa0bar did not improve the permeate flux and salt rejection, while to more than 50\xa0bar led to higher rejection as well as more permeate flux of reclaimed wastewater. Based on analysis of model equations developed, the extent of flux and salt rejection required for reuse of the reclaimed wastewater occurred under different optimal conditions depending on variations in seasons and salinity of wastewater. In particular, it was necessary to add additional pressure exceeding 50\xa0bar or increase the temperature to over 20\xb0C when wastewater of more than 20\u2030 salinity flows into the treatment system.

The results revealed that adsorption of Cr(VI) was highly pH dependent and the kinetics of the adsorption followed by the Avrami fractional-order and pseudo-second-order kinetic models. The results showed that the adsorption isotherms were more accurately represented by Langmuir and Liu isotherm models with a sorption capacity of 30.0\xa0mg\xa0g\u22121. Adsorption experiments with co-ions indicated that the adsorptive removal of Cr(VI) ions was slightly decreased.

Their toxicological impact is currently intensely studied, mostly upon acute exposure, but their intracellular dissolution and fate is rather poorly documented. In this study, murine primary macrophages were exposed to a single high but non-lethal dose of Ag-NPs or to repeated, low doses of Ag-NPs. Cells were either collected immediately after acute exposure or after 72\u2009h of recovery in the NP-free exposure medium. Ag intracellular content and distribution were analyzed by particle-induced X-ray emission, transmission electron microscopy coupled to energy-dispersive spectroscopy analysis and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. In parallel, macrophage functionality as well as inflammatory and thiol-responses were assessed after Ag-NP exposure. We show that Ag accumulation in macrophages is similar upon acute and repeated exposure to Ag-NPs, and that Ag is partly expelled from cells during the 72\u2009h recovery stage. However, acute exposure leads to a strong response of macrophages, characterized by reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, phagocytic capacity and nitric oxide (NO) production upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. Under this condition, we also show an increased release of proinflammatory cytokines as well as a decreased release of anti-inflammatory cytokines. This response is reversible since these biomarkers reach their basal level after the recovery phase; and is much less intense in repeatedly exposed cells. These results suggest that repeated exposure of macrophages to Ag-NPs, which is a more realistic exposure scenario than acute exposure, leads to significant Ag intracellular accumulation but a much less intense toxicological response.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Different_i_in_vitro_i_exposure_regimens_of_murine_primary_macrophages_to_silver_nanoparticles_induce_different_fates_of_nanoparticles_and_different_toxicological_and_functional_consequences/3120001', [u'Biochemistry', u'Space Science', u'Physical Sciences', u'Medicine', u'Cell Biology', u'Physiology', u'Biotechnology', u'Environmental Sciences', u'Chemical Sciences', u'Immunology', u'Biological Sciences'], []]

The conglomerate was divided into five depositional facies associations according to their clast-type abundances and interlayered volcanic rocks. The lowermost member has a maximum depositional age based on young zircon grain ages varying from ca. 63 to 81\xa0Ma.

The lack of pre-Jurassic grains implies that possible sources such as the Nazas arc or the Potos\xed fan were not cropping out at that time, or at least that these areas were not affected by the fluvial system feeding the Zacatecas Conglomerate.

The Hugete Formation is conformably overlain by the Sanmianjing Formation, and the detrital modes of sandstones from these two formations indicate that they were mainly derived from a continental block source. The geochemical characteristics of sandstones and pelites from the Hugete Formation suggest deposition in a shallow marine environment and derivation from a source composed of predominantly felsic magmatic rocks. Detrital zircon ages from the sandstones of the Hugete Formation include age modes at approximately 2500 and 1800\xa0Ma, with smaller modes at 380\u2013404 and 288.2\xa0\xb1\xa08.2\xa0Ma. Combined with previously reported age-diagnostic fossils, the youngest age of 288.2\xa0\xb1\xa08.2\xa0Ma constrains the depositional age of the Hugete and Sanmianjing Formations to the early Permian. Based on regional geology, these age data reveal that the following: (1) the sedimentary rocks of the Hugete and Sanmianjing Formations were sourced mainly from the NCC, located to the south; (2) the early Palaeozoic accretionary arc complex at the northern margin of the NCC experienced intense erosion before the early Permian and thus it did not appear as a concurrent hinterland uplift during the deposition of the Hugete and Sanmianjing Formations; and (3) no significant topography was generated between the study area and the NCC by the early Permian island arc and orogen. Age distribution patterns, as well as geochemical and petrographic data, indicate that the Hugete and Sanmianjing Formations were deposited in a newly opened intra-continental ocean basin formed in an extensional tectonic environment.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Petrography_geochemistry_and_U_8211_Pb_detrital_zircon_dating_of_early_Permian_sedimentary_rocks_from_the_North_Flank_of_the_North_China_Craton_Implications_for_the_late_Palaeozoic_tectonic_evolution_of_the_eastern_Central_Asian_Orogenic_Belt/1627955', [u'Biochemistry', u'Environmental Sciences', u'Chemical Sciences', u'Astronomical and Space Sciences', u'Sociology', u'Biological Sciences', u'Developmental Biology', u'Cancer', u'Inorganic Chemistry'], []]

In this contribution, structural, microstructural, quartz c-axis fabric, magnetic fabric, and geochronologic data are used to determine the structural framework of the Yao Shan massif and its tectonic implications for the ASRR shear zone. The Yao Shan complex is characterized by an overall linear A-type antiform that contains a core of high-grade metamorphic rocks with Palaeoproterozoic to Mesozoic protoliths and a mantle of Permo-Triassic low-grade rocks. Both the high-grade metamorphic core and low-grade Permo-Triassic rocks have experienced progressive ductile shearing. Anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) results from 17 samples collected along the Xinjie\u2013Pingbian section across the complex show that magnetic lineation (Kmax) and foliation (Kmax\u2013Kint) are generally subparallel to the corresponding structural elements in the sheared rocks. The shape parameter E values of the magnetic ellipsoids are indicative of dominantly oblate and plane strain, but vary with protolith type and degree of strain among the various rock types. In agreement with the field and microstructural observations, the corrected degree of anisotropy (Pj) values reflect high shear strain in the core rocks and relatively low shear strain in the low-grade strata. A kinematic analysis based on structural and magnetic fabric data shows that both left- and right-lateral shear occurred during the deformation of the Yao Shan complex. Therefore, instead of being an element of the ASRR shear zone, the Yao Shan complex constitutes a crustal-scale inharmonic A-type fold with a fold axis parallel to the stretching lineation. Geochronologic data reveal that the folding occurred coevally with ductile shearing of the middle to lower crust between ca. 30 and 21\xa0Ma.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Structural_geometry_and_kinematics_of_the_Ailao_Shan_shear_zone_insights_from_integrated_structural_microstructural_and_fabric_studies_of_the_Yao_Shan_complex_Yunnan_Southwest_China/2067123', [u'Biophysics', u'Biochemistry', u'Space Science', u'Physical Sciences', u'Biotechnology', u'Environmental Sciences', u'Chemical Sciences', u'Ecology', u'Biological Sciences'], []]

Some workers divide TC-amphibolites into Todd and Edmonds types, based on mineral and geochemical differences, and we provisionally add a third type \u2013 olivine \xb1 pyroxene-rich, Rich Mountain-type rocks. Regionally, MUR bodies range from equant, Rich Mountain- to highly elongate, Todd-TC-amphibolite-type bodies. The MURs exhibit three to five mineral associations containing assemblages with olivine, anthophyllitic amphibole, Mg-hornblende, Mg-actinolite, cummingtonite, and serpentine representing decreasing eclogite to greenschist facies grades of metamorphism over time. MUR protoliths are difficult to determine. Southwestern MUR bodies have remnant olivine \xb1 pyroxene-rich assemblages representing ultrabasic-basic, dunite-peridotite-pyroxenite protoliths. Northeastern TC-amphibolite MURs contain hornblende and actinolitic amphiboles plus chlorites \u2013 aluminous and calcic assemblages suggesting to some that metasomatism of basic, QF-amphibolites yields all TC-amphibolites. Yet MgO-CaO-Al2O3 and trace element chemistries of many TC-amphibolites resemble compositions of plagioclase peridotites. We show that a few AMS TC-amphibolites had basaltic/gabbroic protoliths, while presenting arguments opposing application of the metasomatic hypothesis to all TC-amphibolites. We establish that MUR bodies are petrologically heterolithic and that TC-amphibolites are in contact with many rock types; that those with high Cr, Ni, and Mg have olivine- or pyroxene-dominated protoliths; that most exhibit three or more metamorphic mineral associations; and that contacts thought to be metasomatic are structural. Clearly, different MUR bodies have different chemistries representing various protoliths, and have different mineral assemblages, reflecting both chemical composition and metamorphic history. Spot sampling of heterolithic MUR bodies does not reveal MUR body character or history or allow \u2018type\u2019 designations. We recommend that the subdivision of MUR bodies into \u2018types\u2019 be abandoned and that the metasomatic hypothesis be carefully applied.

The main use of bagasse is to produce compost in tequila factories with a long traditional composting that lasts 6\u20138 months. The aim of this study was to evaluate the degradation of agave bagasse by combining a pretreatment with fungi and vermicomposting. Experiments were carried out with fractionated or whole bagasse, sterilized or not, subjecting it to a pretreatment with Bjerkandera adusta alone or combined with native fungi, or only with native bagasse fungi (non-sterilized), for 45 days. This was followed by a vermicomposting with Eisenia fetida and sewage sludge, for another 45 days. Physicochemical parameters, lignocellulose degradation, stability and maturity changes were measured. The results indicated that up to 90% of the residual sugars in bagasse were eliminated after 30 days in all treatments. The highest degradation rate in pretreatment was observed in non-sterilized, fractionated bagasse with native fungi plus B. adusta (BNFns) (71% hemicellulose, 43% cellulose and 71% lignin) at 45 days. The highest total degradation rates after vermicomposting were in fractionated bagasse pre-treated with native fungi (94% hemicellulose, 86% cellulose and 91% lignin). However, the treatment BNFns showed better maturity and stability parameters compared to that reported for traditional composts. Thus, it seems that a process involving vermicomposting and pretreatment with B. adusta could reduce the degradation time of bagasse to 3 months, compared to the traditional composting process, which requires from 6 to 8 months.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Use_of_agave_bagasse_for_production_of_an_organic_fertilizer_by_pretreatment_with_i_Bjerkandera_adusta_i_and_vermicomposting_with_i_Eisenia_fetida_i_/1587071', [u'Medicine', u'Microbiology', u'Ecology', u'Immunology', u'Biological Sciences', u'Cancer', u'Science Policy'], []]

Surface area increased from 225.5 to 484.7\xa0m2\xa0g\u22121, point of zero charge decreased from 6.0 to 3.2, iodine number increased from 4 to 80, total amount of surface acidic groups increased from 1.12 to 2.3\xa0mmol\xa0g\u22121 and adsorption capacity increased from 0.53 to 5.27\xa0mg\xa0g\u22121, with increasing H2SO4 concentration from 0 to 96%. The pseudo-first- and pseudo-second-order kinetic models have been used to analyze the kinetics of the adsorption; it was found that kinetic experimental data were successfully fitted by the pseudo-first-order model. Equilibrium data were mathematically interpreted by applying the Langmuir, Freundlich, and Dubinin\u2013Radushkevich models; the results indicate that Freundlich model provides the best correlation. Negative values of Gibbs free energy suggest an endothermic and spontaneous adsorption process. The mechanism of Cr(VI) removal involves adsorption of Cr(VI) followed by its partial reduction to Cr(III). Analysis of thermodynamic parameters, coupled with modeling of experimental data with two different intraparticle diffusion models, revealed that binding of Cr(VI) occurred via physisorption, while the rate-limiting step was film diffusion.

Autophagy is a cell survival process, which is responsible for the degradation of damaged organelles and misfolded proteins. Here we show an activation of autophagosomal formation and autophagosome-lysosome fusion in placentas of males but not females from overweight (OW) and obese (OB) women vs. normal weight (NW) women. However, total autophagic activity in these placentas appeared to be decreased as it showed an increase in SQSTM1/p62 and a decrease in lysosomal biogenesis. A mouse model with a targeted deletion of the essential autophagy gene Atg7 in placental tissue showed significant placental abnormalities comparable to those seen in human placenta with maternal obesity. These included a decrease in expression of mitochondrial genes and antioxidants, and decreased lysosomal biogenesis. Strikingly, the knockout mice were developmentally programmed as they showed an increased sensitivity to high-fat diet-induced obesity, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, increased adiposity, and cardiac remodeling.

[u'Ferritinophagy drives uropathogenic <i>Escherichia coli</i> persistence in bladder epithelial cells', ['Kyle A. Bauckman', 'Indira U. Mysorekar'], u'2016-03-22T20:03:29Z', u'Autophagy is a cellular recycling pathway, which in many cases, protects host cells from infections by degrading pathogens. However, uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), the predominant cause of urinary tract infections (UTIs), persist within the urinary tract epithelium (urothelium) by forming reservoirs within autophagosomes. Iron is a critical nutrient for both host and pathogen, and regulation of iron availability is a key host defense against pathogens. Iron homeostasis depends on the shuttling of iron-bound ferritin to the lysosome for recycling, a process termed ferritinophagy (a form of selective autophagy). Here, we demonstrate for the first time that UPEC shuttles with ferritin bound iron into the autophagosomal and lysosomal compartments within the urothelium. Iron overload in urothelial cells induces ferritinophagy in a NCOA4 dependent manner causing increase iron availability for UPEC, triggering bacterial overproliferation and host cell death. Addition of even moderate levels of iron is sufficient to increase and prolong bacterial burden. Furthermore, we show that lysosomal damage due to iron overload is the specific mechanism causing host cell death. Significantly, we demonstrate that host cell death and bacterial burden can be reversed by inhibition of autophagy or inhibition of iron-regulatory proteins, or chelation of iron. Together, our findings suggest that UPEC persist in host cells by taking advantage of ferritinophagy. Thus, modulation of iron levels in the bladder may provide a therapeutic avenue to controlling UPEC persistence, epithelial cell death, and recurrent UTIs.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Ferritinophagy_drives_uropathogenic_i_Escherichia_coli_i_persistence_in_bladder_epithelial_cells/3121861', [u'Medicine', u'Microbiology', u'Cell Biology', u'Genetics', u'Molecular Biology', u'Biotechnology', u'Immunology', u'Biological Sciences', u'Mathematical Sciences', u'Cancer', u'Inorganic Chemistry', u'Hematology', u'Infectious Diseases', u'Virology'], []]

Sorption experiments were carried out as a function of pH, time, initial As(V) concentration and biosorbent dose, using NOP and COP (pretreated with sulfuric acid). Arsenate sorption was found to be maximum at pH 6.5, with higher As(V) removal percentage (98%) by COP than NOP (68%) at 4\xa0g L\u22121 optimum biosorbent dose. Sorption isotherm data exhibited a higher As(V) sorption (60.9\xa0mg g\u22121) for COP than NOP (32.7\xa0mg g\u22121). Langmuir model provided the best fit to describe As(V) sorption.

The present study shows evidence that different substrate textures (coarse and fine laterite) do not significantly change the partitioning of root and shoot dry biomass and with few exceptions, do not significantly affect the final average concentration of elements in Eremanthus erythropappus, but change the root:shoot allocation of both essential nutrients and elements potentially toxic to biota. Growth on coarse laterite resulted in significant higher K (30%), Mg (34%), P (25%), S (32%), Cu (58%), and Na (43%) concentrations in roots and lower Cd concentration (29%). In shoots, coarse laterite led to reduction in K, Fe, Al, and Cr and increase in Na and Sr concentrations. Changes in element allocation could be, in part, a result of differences in the water availability of substrates.

Although mammary carcinoma brain metastases are more frequent than those originating from melanoma, this latter has the highest tropism to the brain. Using static and dynamic in vitro approaches, here we show that melanoma cells have increased adhesion to the brain endothelium in comparison to breast cancer cells. Moreover, melanoma cells can transmigrate more rapidly and in a higher number through brain endothelial monolayers than breast cancer cells. In addition, melanoma cells have increased ability to impair tight junctions of cerebral endothelial cells. We also show that inhibition of Rac or PI3K impedes adhesion of breast cancer cells and melanoma cells to the brain endothelium. In addition, inhibition of Rac or PI3K inhibits the late phase of transmigration of breast cancer cells and the early phase of transmigration of melanoma cells. On the other hand, the Rac inhibitor EHT1864 impairs the junctional integrity of the brain endothelium, while the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 has no damaging effect on interendothelial junctions.

Elected politicians, and especially those under bailout programmes, have strong incentives to minimise the direct budgetary effects of aiding failing financial institutions. By establishing and enforcing new rules about which crisis responses directly hit member state budgets and which did not, Eurostat created incentives to choose certain policies.

Robbins', 'Anja Brandecker', 'Michelle Cronin', 'Mark Jessopp', 'Rob McAllen', 'Ross Culloch'], u'2016-01-05T14:53:06Z', u'C-PODs are static passive acoustic monitoring devices used to detect odontocete vocalizations in the range of 20\u2013160\xa0kHz. However, falsely classified detections may be an issue, particularly with broadband species (i.e. many dolphin species) due to anthropogenic and other noise occurring at the same frequency. While porpoise detections are verified using species-specific acoustic parameters, the equivalent does not currently exist for verifying dolphin detections. Development of such parameters would increase the accuracy of dolphin detections and eliminate the need for additional monitoring techniques or devices, reducing the cost of monitoring programmes. Herein, we present parameters based on acoustic characteristics of bottlenose (n\xa0=\xa029), common (n\xa0=\xa019) and Risso\u2019s (n\xa0=\xa099) dolphin click trains, sighted within 1\xa0km of C-PODs during land-based surveys, for in-software verification. Overlap of click train parameters among dolphin species prevented robust species identification; therefore, parameters were devised for these dolphin species collectively using frequency, inter-click interval and click train duration. A data set of 4898 Detection Positive Hours was visually verified using these parameters. The temporal and spatial patterns in the visually verified data were similar to land-based observations, suggesting the parameters operate at an acceptable accuracy. However, 68% of high-, moderate- and low-quality KERNO detections were false-positive. Our results suggest that the accuracy of classifiers and quality class weightings are site-specific, and we highlight the importance of data exploration to make the most appropriate software choices based on the aims of a study.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Handling_dolphin_detections_from_C_PODs_with_the_development_of_acoustic_parameters_for_verification_and_the_exploration_of_species_identification_possibilities/1629354', [u'Environmental Sciences', u'Ecology', u'Biological Sciences', u'Information Systems'], []]

Kleinhappel', 'Nadezhda Shivarova', 'James F. C. Windmill', 'Fernando Montealegre-Z'], u'2016-01-05T14:52:30Z', u'Male field crickets generate calls to attract distant females through tegminal stridulation: the rubbing together of the overlying right wing which bears a file of cuticular teeth against the underlying left wing which carries a sclerotized scraper. During stridulation, specialized areas of membrane on both wings are set into oscillating vibrations to produce acoustic radiation. The location of females is unknown to the calling males and thus increasing effective signal range in all directions will maximize transmission effectiveness. However, producing an omnidirectional sound field of high sound pressure levels may be problematic due to the mechanical asymmetry found in this sound generation system. Mechanical asymmetry occurs by the right wing coming to partially cover the left wing during the closing stroke phase of stridulation. As such, it is hypothesized that the sound field on the left-wing side of the animal will contain lower sound pressure components than on the right-wing side as a result of this coverage. This hypothesis was tested using a novel method to accurately record a high-resolution, three dimensional mapping of sound pressure levels around restrained Gryllus bimaculatus field crickets singing under pharmacological stimulation. The results indicate that a bilateral asymmetry is present across individuals, with greater amplitude components present in the right-wing side of the animal. Individual variation in sound pressure to either the right- or left-wing side is also observed. However, statistically significant differences in bilateral sound field asymmetry as presented here may not affect signalling in the field.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Distribution_of_sound_pressure_around_a_singing_cricket_radiation_pattern_and_asymmetry_in_the_sound_field/1628815', [u'Physical Sciences', u'Molecular Biology', u'Neuroscience', u'Evolutionary Biology', u'Biological Sciences', u'Developmental Biology', u'Inorganic Chemistry', u'Science Policy'], []]

These negative consequences provide a unifying purpose for the maritime industry and biosecurity managers to prevent biofouling accumulation and transfer, but important gaps exist between these sectors. This mini-review examines the approach to assessments of ship biofouling among sectors (industry, biosecurity and marine science) and the implications for existing and emerging management of biofouling. The primary distinctions between industry and biosecurity in assessment of vessels biofouling revolve around the resolution of biological information collected and the specific wetted surface areas of primary concern to each sector. The morphological characteristics of biofouling and their effects on propulsion dynamics are of primary concern to industry, with an almost exclusive focus on the vertical sides and flat bottom of hulls and an emphasis on antifouling and operational performance. In contrast, the identity, biogeography, and ecology of translocated organisms is of highest concern to invasion researchers and biosecurity managers and policymakers, especially as it relates to species with known histories of invasion elsewhere. Current management practices often provide adequate, although not complete, provision for hull surfaces, but niche areas are well known to enhance biosecurity risk. As regulations to prevent invasions emerge in this arena, there is a growing opportunity for industry, biosecurity and academic stakeholders to collaborate and harmonize efforts to assess and manage biofouling of ships that should lead to more comprehensive biofouling solutions that promote industry goals while reducing biosecurity risk and greenhouse gas emissions.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Mini_review_Assessing_the_drivers_of_ship_biofouling_management_aligning_industry_and_biosecurity_goals/3080920', [u'Environmental Sciences', u'Ecology', u'Biological Sciences', u'Science Policy', u'Infectious Diseases'], []]

[u'Taxing choices: international competition, domestic institutions and the transformation of corporate tax policy', ['Duane Swank'], u'2015-07-01T00:00:00Z', u"Since the 1980s, notable corporate tax base broadening and rate reductions have occurred throughout the rich democracies. Scholars agree that tax competition for mobile assets shapes this transformation. I address two questions in this article. First, what form has tax competition taken and, second, how have domestic institutions conditioned competition's impact? I build on past work and argue that tax competition is characterized by the (Stackelberg) leadership of the United States as opposed to alternative forms of competition. At the same time, domestic institutions, especially the degree to which the nation is a co-ordinated versus liberal market economy, are central determinants of the pace of reform. I test these propositions with models of 1982\u20132008 tax rate change in 18 capitalist democracies. I find that rising trade openness and capital mobility place downward pressures on tax rates, the United States' adoption of the neoliberal tax model engenders significant competitive responses from other nations, and that the institutions of co-ordinated economies slow the pace of neoliberal reforms. High public debt, left-leaning median voters and institutional veto points also significantly constrain tax policy change. I conclude with some reflections on tax policy in the wake of the global financial crisis and on neoliberalism and institutional change in advanced democratic capitalism.", u'https://figshare.com/articles/Taxing_choices_international_competition_domestic_institutions_and_the_transformation_of_corporate_tax_policy/1470152', [u'Neuroscience', u'Pharmacology', u'Environmental Sciences', u'Ecology', u'Sociology', u'Science Policy'], []]

But using \u2018country-year\u2019 data artificially inflates the number of cases and leads to biased estimates, as governments usually do not change annually. Second, using party families as proxies for party preferences assumes that parties within families hold similar positions while they differ across families. But this is empirically often not the case. Finally, a historical institutionalist perspective suggests that we should not expect party effects anymore in the first place. Empirically, we propose a new design, using direct measures of party preferences in analyses on government-term level.

It was found that this surface had a ks\xa0=\xa00.325\xa0mm, substantially less than the previously reported values for light calcareous fouling. This result was used to predict the drag on a fouled full scale ship. To achieve this, a modified method for predicting the total drag of a spatially developing turbulent boundary layer (TBL), such as that on the hull of a ship, is presented. The method numerically integrates the skin friction over the length of the boundary layer, assuming an analytical form for the mean velocity profile of the TBL. The velocity profile contains the roughness (fouling) information, such that the prediction requires only an input of ks, the free-stream velocity (ship speed), the kinematic viscosity and the length of the boundary layer (the hull length). Using the equivalent sandgrain roughness height determined from experiments, a FFG-7 Oliver Perry class frigate is predicted to experience a 23% increase in total resistance at cruise, if its hull is coated in light calcareous tubeworm fouling. A similarly fouled very large crude carrier would experience a 34% increase in total resistance at cruise.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/An_assessment_of_the_ship_drag_penalty_arising_from_light_calcareous_tubeworm_fouling/3101347', [u'Biophysics', u'Space Science', u'Medicine', u'Microbiology', u'Molecular Biology', u'Biotechnology', u'Environmental Sciences', u'Biological Sciences', u'Infectious Diseases', u'Plant Biology'], []]

The particles are made by co-precipitation and designed to bind to bacteria in biofilms, impede biofilm build-up without killing the microflora, and release phosphate ions to buffer bacterial acid production if the pH decreases below 6. Analysis of biofilm formation and pH in a five-species biofilm model for dental caries showed that treatment with particles or pure osteopontin led to less biofilm formation compared to untreated controls or biofilms treated with osteopontin-free particles. The anti-biofilm effect can thus be ascribed to osteopontin. The particles also led to a slower acidification of the biofilm after exposure to glucose, and the pH always remained above 5.5. Hence, calcium-phosphate-osteopontin particles show potential for applications in caries control.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Calcium_phosphate_osteopontin_particles_for_caries_control/2977240', [u'Biochemistry', u'Microbiology', u'Cell Biology', u'Biotechnology', u'Chemical Sciences', u'Ecology', u'Inorganic Chemistry', u'Infectious Diseases', u'Virology'], []]

Here, we demonstrate that silica NPs effect widespread protein aggregation in the soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans ranging from induction of amyloid in nucleoli of intestinal cells to facilitation of protein aggregation in body wall muscles and axons of neural cells. Proteomic screening revealed that exposure of adult C. elegans with silica NPs promotes segregation of proteins belonging to the gene ontology (GO) group of \u201cprotein folding, proteolysis and stress response\u201d to an SDS-resistant aggregome network. Candidate proteins in this group include chaperones, heat shock proteins and subunits of the 26S proteasome which are all decisively involved in protein homeostasis. The pathway of protein homeostasis was validated as a major target of silica NPs by behavioral phenotyping, as inhibitors of amyloid formation rescued NP-induced defects of locomotory patterns and egg laying. The analysis of a reporter worm for serotonergic neural cells revealed that silica NP-induced protein aggregation likewise occurs in axons of HSN neurons, where presynaptic accumulation of serotonin, e.g. disturbed axonal transport reduces the capacity for neurotransmission and egg laying. The results suggest that in C. elegans silica NPs promote a cascade of events including disturbance of protein homeostasis, widespread protein aggregation and inhibition of serotonergic neurotransmission which can be interrupted by compounds preventing amyloid fibrillation.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Anti_amyloid_compounds_protect_from_silica_nanoparticle_induced_neurotoxicity_in_the_nematode_i_C_elegans_i_/1568294', [u'Biophysics', u'Biochemistry', u'Cell Biology', u'Genetics', u'Molecular Biology', u'Neuroscience', u'Pharmacology', u'Chemical Sciences', u'Developmental Biology', u'Inorganic Chemistry'], []]

MWCNT directly stimulated the proliferation of fibroblasts primed with low concentrations of growth factors, such as PDGF, TGF-\u03b2 or EGF.

To understand the role of fatty acids in disease epigenetics, we sought DNA methylation profiles specifically induced by arachidonic (AA) or oleic acid (OA) in cultured cells and compared those with published profiles of normal and diseased tissues. THP-1 monocytes were stimulated with AA or OA and analyzed using Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (Illumina) and Human Exon 1.0 ST array (Affymetrix). Data were corroborated in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Comparisons with publicly available data were conducted by standard bioinformatics. AA and OA elicited a complex response marked by a general DNA hypermethylation and hypomethylation in the 1\u2013200\xa0\u03bcM range, respectively, with a maximal differential response at the 100\xa0\u03bcM dose. The divergent response to AA and OA was prominent within the gene body of target genes, where it correlated positively with transcription. AA-induced DNA methylation profiles were similar to the corresponding profiles described for palmitic acid, atherosclerosis, diabetes, obesity, and autism, but relatively dissimilar from OA-induced profiles. Furthermore, human atherosclerosis grade-associated DNA methylation profiles were significantly enriched in AA-induced profiles. Biochemical evidence pointed to \u03b2-oxidation, PPAR-alpha, and sirtuin 1 as important mediators of AA-induced DNA methylation changes.

The aim of this study was to identify associations between candidate circadian gene variants and the polysomnogram, recorded under highly controlled laboratory conditions during a baseline, overnight, 8 h sleep opportunity. A candidate gene approach was employed to analyze single-nucleotide polymorphisms from five circadian-related genes in a two-phase analysis of 84 healthy young adults (28 F; 23.21 \xb1 2.97 years) of European ancestry. A common variant in Period2 (PER2) was associated with 20 min less slow-wave sleep (SWS) in carriers of the minor allele than in noncarriers, representing a 22% reduction in SWS duration. Moreover, spectral analysis in a subset of participants (n = 37) showed the same PER2 polymorphism was associated with reduced EEG power density in the low delta range (0.25\u20131.0 Hz) during non-REM sleep and lower slow-wave activity (0.75\u20134.5 Hz) in the early part of the sleep episode. These results indicate the involvement of PER2 in the homeostatic process of sleep. Additionally, a rare variant in Melatonin Receptor 1B was associated with longer REM sleep latency, with minor allele carriers exhibiting an average of 65 min (87%) longer latency from sleep onset to REM sleep, compared to noncarriers.

In this article, we advocate that for some mixture experiments the slack-variable model has appealing properties including numerical stability and better prediction accuracy when model-term selection is performed. We also explain how the effects of the slack-variable model components should be interpreted and how easy it is for practitioners to understand the components effects.

Results: Opioid-only users were the largest group (n = 622), followed by cocaine-only (n = 144) and co-users (n = 73).

Co-users did not have significantly greater incidence of any psychiatric conditions, medial conditions, or events. In preliminary analyses, co-users were more likely than either single use group to report several classes of other drug use. However, for most comparisons, opioid use did not add substantial risk beyond cocaine use. Differences on multiple sociodemographic variables suggested opioid-only users were at lowest risk of negative outcomes.

Febrifugine analogues are natural compound obtained from the traditional Chinese herbs have shown significant antimalarial and anticancerous efficacy in experimental model. Development of resistance against the existing antimalarial drug has alarmed the scientific innovators to find a potential antimalarial molecule which can be further used by endemic countries for the elimination of this disease. In this study, structure-based virtual screening and molecular dynamics (MD) base approaches were used to generate potential antimalarial compound against plasmepsin II and prolyl-tRNA synthetase of Plasmodium. Here, we have docked series of febrifugine analogues (n\xa0=\xa011,395) against plasmepsin II in three different docking modes and then it was compared with previously reported target prolyl-tRNA synthetase. Extra precision docking resulted into 235 ligands having better docking score were subject for QikProp analysis. Better ligands (n\xa0=\xa039) obtained from QikProp analysis were subject for ADMET prediction and docking protocol validation through the estimation of receiver operator characteristics. In the later stage, 24 ligands obtained from ADMET study were subject for the estimation of binding energy through MM-GBSA and same were also docked against prolyl-tRNA synthetase to get compounds with dual inhibitor role. Finally, MD simulation and 2D fingerprint MACCS study of two best ligands have shown significant interaction with plasmepsin II and homology against known active ligand with noteworthy MACCS index, respectively. This study concludes that FA12 could be potential drug candidate to fight against Plasmodium falciparum parasites.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Exploring_dual_inhibitory_role_of_febrifugine_analogues_against_i_Plasmodium_i_utilizing_structure_based_virtual_screening_and_molecular_dynamic_simulation/3181183', [u'Biochemistry', u'Physical Sciences', u'Molecular Biology', u'Pharmacology', u'Biotechnology', u'Chemical Sciences', u'Biological Sciences'], []]
[u'Conformal prediction to define applicability domain \u2013 A case study on predicting ER and AR binding', ['U. Norinder', 'A. Rybacka', 'P.L. Andersson'], u'2016-04-18T17:12:58Z', u'A fundamental element when deriving a robust and predictive in silico model is not only the statistical quality of the model in question but, equally important, the estimate of its predictive boundaries. This work presents a new method, conformal prediction, for applicability domain estimation in the field of endocrine disruptors. The method is applied to binders and non-binders related to the oestrogen and androgen receptors. Ensembles of decision trees are used as statistical method and three different sets (dragon, rdkit and signature fingerprints) are investigated as chemical descriptors. The conformal prediction method results in valid models where there is an excellent balance in quality between the internally validated training set and the corresponding external test set, both in terms of validity and with respect to sensitivity and specificity. With this method the level of confidence can be readily altered by the user and the consequences thereof immediately inspected. Furthermore, the predictive boundaries for the derived models are rigorously defined by using the conformal prediction framework, thus no ambiguity exists as to the level of similarity needed for new compounds to be in or out of the predictive boundaries of the derived models where reliable predictions can be expected.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Conformal_prediction_to_define_applicability_domain_A_case_study_on_predicting_ER_and_AR_binding/3181174', [u'Biophysics', u'Biochemistry', u'Chemical Sciences', u'Biological Sciences', u'Information Systems', u'Mathematical Sciences', u'Computational  Biology'], []]

It is formed by the EhCP112 cysteine protease and the EhADH adhesin. To explore the molecular basis of the complex formation, three-dimensional models were built for both proteins and molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) and docking calculations were performed. Results predicted that the pEhCP112 proenzyme and the mEhCP112 mature enzyme were globular and peripheral membrane proteins. Interestingly, in pEhCP112, the propeptide appeared hiding the catalytic site (C167, H329, N348); while in mEhCP112, this site was exposed and its residues were found structurally closer than in pEhCP112. EhADH emerged as an extended peripheral membrane protein with high fluctuation in Bro1 and V shape domains. 500\xa0ns-long MDS and protein\u2013protein docking predictions evidenced different heterodimeric complexes with the lowest free energy. pEhCP112 interacted with EhADH by the propeptide and C-terminal regions and mEhCP112 by the C-terminal through hydrogen bonds. In contrast, EhADH bound to mEhCP112 by 442\u2013479 residues, adjacent to the target cell-adherence region (480\u2013600 residues), and by the Bro1 domain (9\u2013349 residues). Calculations of the effective binding free energy and per residue free energy decomposition showed that EhADH binds to mEhCP112 with a higher binding energy than to pEhCP112, mainly through van der Waals interactions and the nonpolar part of solvation energy. The EhADH and EhCP112 structural relationship was validated in trophozoites by immunofluorescence, TEM, and immunoprecipitation assays. Experimental findings fair agreed with in silico results.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Heterodimerization_of_the_i_Entamoeba_histolytica_i_EhCPADH_virulence_complex_through_molecular_dynamics_and_protein_protein_docking/3181165', [u'Biophysics', u'Biochemistry', u'Physical Sciences', u'Molecular Biology', u'Pharmacology', u'Chemical Sciences', u'Biological Sciences'], []]

Acknowledging the variation in programmatic profiles between niche parties and over time, the article argues that the electoral effects of nicheness and programmatic concentration as programmatic features of niche parties vary over their lifecycle. When entering the electoral arena, niche parties benefit from high levels of nicheness and programmatic concentration. However, these positive effects decrease as parties grow older and face different challenges to those of their early days. The empirical analysis of green and extreme right parties in this article supports the corresponding hypotheses. Results show that the positive effects of nicheness and programmatic concentration vanish over time and indicate niche parties\u2019 own influence on their electoral destiny.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/How_programmatic_profiles_of_niche_parties_affect_their_electoral_performance/3181153', [u'Biochemistry', u'Environmental Sciences', u'Sociology', u'Information Systems', u'Mental Health'], []]

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis indicates that 1 consists of the well-known zinc paddle-wheel motif which is linked by bridging dicarboxylates to form 2-D square grids. The 2-D layers stack offset due to the effect of the spatial structure of MbIm ligand and hydrogen-bonding interaction between MbIm and guest molecules. Similarly, 2 is constructed by six-connected Cd3(\u03bc-O2CR)6(MbIm)2 units and bridging carboxylates, resulting in a 2-D layer structure with triangular grids.

This results in large amounts of FS being dumped into the environment. Existing treatment technologies for FS, such as settling-thickening tanks and drying beds, are land intensive which is limiting in urban areas. Enhanced settling and dewatering by conditioning was evaluated in order to reduce the treatment footprint (or increase treatment capacity). Conventional wastewater conditioners, such as commercially available lime and polymers, are expensive, and commonly rely on complex supply chains for use in low-income countries. Therefore, the treatment performance of five conditioners which could be produced locally was evaluated: Moringa oleifera seeds and press cake, Jatropha curcas seeds, Jatropha Calotropis leaves and chitosan. M. oleifera seeds and press cake, and chitosan improved settling and dewatering and had a similar performance compared to lime and polymers. Optimal dosages were 400\u2013500\u2005kg M. oleifera/t TS, 300\u2013800\u2005kg lime/t TS and 25\u201350\u2005kg polymer solution/t TS. In comparison, chitosan required 1.5\u20133.75\u2005kg/t TS. These dosages are comparable to those recommended for wastewater (sludge). The results indicate that conditioning of FS can reduce total suspended solids (TSS) in the effluent of settling-thickening tanks by 22\u201381% and reduce dewatering time with drying beds by 59\u201397%. This means that the area of drying beds could be reduced by 59\u201397% with end-use as soil conditioner, or 9\u201326% as solid fuel.

Here we propose a new standard for exchange of patient phenotype data that is optimized for integration from these distributed contexts. The PXF standard will allow phenotypic data to be captured at the point of publication, to be transmitted in the context of diagnostic testing, to be used for exchange of data in clinical studies, and as a backbone for patient-contributed data registries and social media.

[u'Bromocriptine-QR therapy for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus: developmental basis and therapeutic profile summary', ['Philip Raskin', 'Anthony H. Cincotta'], u'2016-04-18T09:05:03Z', u'An extended series of studies indicate that endogenous phase shifts in circadian neuronal input signaling to the biological clock system centered within the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) facilitates shifts in metabolic status. In particular, a diminution of the circadian peak in dopaminergic input to the peri-SCN facilitates the onset of fattening, insulin resistance and glucose intolerance while reversal of low circadian peak dopaminergic activity to the peri-SCN via direct timed dopamine administration to this area normalizes the obese, insulin resistant, glucose intolerant state in high fat fed animals. Systemic circadian-timed daily administration of a potent dopamine D2 receptor agonist, bromocriptine, to increase diminished circadian peak dopaminergic hypothalamic activity across a wide variety of animal models of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) results in improvements in the obese, insulin resistant, glucose intolerant condition by improving hypothalamic fuel sensing and reducing insulin resistance, elevated sympathetic tone, and leptin resistance. A circadian-timed (within 2\xa0hours of waking in the morning) once daily administration of a quick release formulation of bromocriptine (bromocriptine-QR) has been approved for the treatment of T2DM by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Clinical studies with such bromocriptine-QR therapy (1.6 to 4.8\xa0mg/day) indicate that it improves glycemic control by reducing postprandial glucose levels without raising plasma insulin. Across studies of various T2DM populations, bromocriptine-QR has been demonstrated to reduce HbA1c by \u20130.5 to \u20131.7. The drug has a good safety profile with transient mild to moderate nausea, headache and dizziness as the most frequent adverse events noted with the medication. In a large randomized clinical study of T2DM subjects, bromocriptine-QR exposure was associated with a 42% hazard ratio reduction of a pre-specified adverse cardiovascular endpoint including myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for congestive heart failure, revascularization surgery, or unstable angina. Bromocriptine-QR represents a novel method of treating T2DM that may have benefits for cardiovascular disease as well.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Bromocriptine_QR_therapy_for_the_management_of_type_2_diabetes_mellitus_developmental_basis_and_therapeutic_profile_summary/3180646', [u'Biochemistry', u'Molecular Biology', u'Neuroscience', u'Physiology', u'Pharmacology', u'Chemical Sciences'], []]

Composting is a possible treatment approved for its safe use. This study aims to assess the influence of using N-rich material (grass clippings) to improve co-composting of ES mixtures for reaching sanitising temperatures imposed by the animal by-product regulation from the European Union. Two sets of mixtures (M1 and M2) were investigated each containing industrial potato peel waste, grass clippings and rice husks at 3:1.9:1 and 3:0:1 ratios by wet weight. In each set, ES composition ranged from 0 to 30% (w/w). Co-composting trials were performed in self-heating reactors for 25 days, followed by maturation in piles. Results showed that only M1 trials attained temperatures higher than 70\xb0C for 9 consecutive hours, but N-losses by stripping on average were 4 to 5-fold higher than M2. In the absence of N-rich material, biodegradability of mixtures was \u201clow\u201d to \u201cmoderate\u201d and organic matter conversion was impaired. Physical, chemical and phytotoxic properties of finished composts were suitable for soil improvement, but M1 took more 54 days to achieve maturity.

Solid state nanopores can meet all these requirements, but to achieve high manufacturing yields at low costs, assays must be tolerant to fabrication imperfections and to nanopore enlargement during operation. This paper presents a model for molecular engineering techniques that meets these goals with the aim of detecting target sequences within DNA. In contrast to methods that require precise geometries, we demonstrate detection using a range of pore geometries. As a result, our assay model tolerates any pore-forming method and in-situ pore enlargement. Using peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probes modified for conjugation with synthetic bulk-adding molecules, pores ranging 15-50 nm in diameter are shown to detect individual PNA-bound DNA. Detection of the CFTRDeltaF508 gene mutation, a codon deletion responsible for ~66% of all cystic fibrosis chromosomes, is demonstrated with a 26-36 nm pore size range by using a size-enhanced PNA probe.

Solid state nanopores can meet all these requirements, but to achieve high manufacturing yields at low costs, assays must be tolerant to fabrication imperfections and to nanopore enlargement during operation. This paper presents a model for molecular engineering techniques that meets these goals with the aim of detecting target sequences within DNA. In contrast to methods that require precise geometries, we demonstrate detection using a range of pore geometries. As a result, our assay model tolerates any pore-forming method and in-situ pore enlargement. Using peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probes modified for conjugation with synthetic bulk-adding molecules, pores ranging 15-50 nm in diameter are shown to detect individual PNA-bound DNA. Detection of the CFTRDeltaF508 gene mutation, a codon deletion responsible for ~66% of all cystic fibrosis chromosomes, is demonstrated with a 26-36 nm pore size range by using a size-enhanced PNA probe.

This article examines the variation in subnational electoral authoritarianism with data from the Russian Federation. First, the article shows that by using a comparative regime classification most Russian subnational cases can be classified as electoral authoritarian between 1991 and 2005. Yet, there are considerable differences in competitiveness between the electoral authoritarian regimes. The article accounts for this variation by drawing on both comparative electoral authoritarianism literature as well as more context-specific explanations. Statistical analysis on 192 subnational electoral authoritarian cases shows that the determinants of Russian subnational authoritarian stability are rather similar to those found in cross-national studies. Subnational (non)competitiveness in Russia appears to be related to the structure of the regional economy and natural resource rents, and to a lesser degree to the specific Russian federal context.

An adaptive management approach has been employed to control hyper-abundant species and guide conservation efforts for vulnerable species, with the goal of maintaining a diverse waterbird community. Four species exhibited increasing or stable population trends (1975\u20132013): Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus; from 0 to 4747 nests); Black-crowned Night-Herons (Nycticorax nycticorax; ranged from 6 to 259 nests); Herring Gulls (Larus argentatus; from 0 to 244 nests); and Caspian Terns (Hydroprogne caspia; from 0 to 496 nests). Cormorants are currently above (2,500 nests), while Caspian Terns (400\u2013600 nests), Night-Herons (100\u2013200 nests) and Herring Gulls (200\u2013300 nests) are within population targets set out in the Hamilton Harbour Remedial Action Plan. Despite conservation efforts, Common Terns (Sterna hirundo) declined from a peak of 1,028 nests (1990) to 333 nests (2013), although currently within the population target (300\u2013600 nests). Ring-billed Gulls (L. delawarensis), through long-term management and habitat restrictions, were reduced from a peak of 39,621 nests (1990) to 11,133 nests (2013), but still exceed the target (<10,000 nests). Changes in the amount of available habitat have affected waterbird distributions: the loss of 42\xa0ha (peak in 1999) of former nesting areas to development has been partially offset by the creation or securement of 1.9\xa0ha of dedicated breeding habitat. Continued management, assessed and refined annually, is required to maintain species diversity in the area. Current management techniques focus on preventing Ring-billed Gulls from nesting on private lands and dedicated Tern nesting habitat, excluding Cormorants from nesting at specific sites, and reducing inter-specific competition with Night-Herons and Herring Gulls. Recommendations and considerations regarding future management and conservation efforts to reach Remedial Action Plan targets in the harbor are outlined.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Population_trends_of_colonial_waterbirds_nesting_in_Hamilton_Harbour_in_relation_to_changes_in_habitat_and_management/3179950', [u'Evolutionary Biology', u'Ecology', u'Biological Sciences', u'Inorganic Chemistry', u'Plant Biology'], []]

Aqueous solutions of sodium nitrate were prepared in concentrations ranging from 5\xa0mg/ml to 5\u22c510\u22125 mg/ml. The solution droplets were injected into a laminar flow with gas temperatures varying from 25 to 150\xb0C, affecting the droplet temperature and the evaporation rate, accordingly. Dried particles with diameters between 0.3 and 18 \xb5m were collected. The properties of the collected microparticles were studied and correlated with a particle formation model which predicted the onset of saturation and crystallization. The model accounted for the dependence of the diffusion coefficient of sodium nitrate in water on droplet viscosity. The viscosity trend for sodium nitrate solutions was determined by studying the relaxation time observed during coalescence of two aqueous sodium nitrate droplets levitated in optical tweezers. The combination of theoretical derivations and experimental results showed that longer time available for crystallization correlates with larger crystal size and higher degrees of crystallinity in the final microparticles.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Effect_of_crystallization_kinetics_on_the_properties_of_spray_dried_microparticles/3179947', [u'Biophysics', u'Biochemistry', u'Space Science', u'Physical Sciences', u'Medicine', u'Environmental Sciences', u'Chemical Sciences', u'Biological Sciences', u'Virology'], []]

McCabe', 'Jeanne Kowalski', 'Paula M. Vertino'], u'2016-04-15T17:10:25Z', u'Aberrant DNA methylation is a critical feature of cancer. Epigenetic therapy seeks to reverse these changes to restore normal gene expression. DNA demethylating agents, including 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine (DAC), are currently used to treat certain leukemias, and can sensitize solid tumors to chemotherapy and immunotherapy. However, it has been difficult to pin the clinical efficacy of these agents to specific demethylation events and the factors that contribute to the durability of response remain largely unknown. Here we examined the genome-wide kinetics of DAC-induced DNA demethylation and subsequent remethylation after drug withdrawal in breast cancer cells. We find that CpGs differ in both their susceptibility to demethylation and propensity for remethylation after drug removal. DAC-induced demethylation was most apparent at CpGs with higher initial methylation levels and further from CpG islands. Once demethylated, such sites exhibited varied remethylation potentials. The most rapidly remethylating CpGs regained >75% of their starting methylation within a month of drug withdrawal. These sites had higher pretreatment methylation levels, were enriched in gene bodies, marked by H3K36me3, and tended to be methylated in normal breast cells. In contrast, a more resistant class of CpG sites failed to regain even 20% of their initial methylation after 3\xa0months. These sites had lower pretreatment methylation levels, were within or near CpG islands, marked by H3K79me2 or H3K4me2/3, and were overrepresented in sites that become aberrantly hypermethylated in breast cancers. Thus, whereas DAC-induced demethylation affects both endogenous and aberrantly methylated sites, tumor-specific hypermethylation is more slowly regained, even as normal methylation promptly recovers. Taken together, these data suggest that the durability of DAC response is linked to its selective ability to stably reset at least a portion of the cancer methylome.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Factors_affecting_the_Persistence_of_Drug_induced_Reprogramming_of_the_Cancer_Methylome/3179941', [u'Biophysics', u'Cell Biology', u'Genetics', u'Molecular Biology', u'Pharmacology', u'Cancer', u'Hematology'], []]

A total of 20 male rats were randomly divided into a fasting group and a control group. Four weeks later, blood and urine samples were taken after decapitation. Analysis of CAs was done using high-performance liquid chromatography with florescence detection (HPLC-FLD). The dopamine (DA), adrenaline (ADR) and noradrenaline (NA) blood and urine concentrations were found to be higher in the fasting group compared to the control group, but the difference was statistically significant only for the blood DA levels (p < 0.05). In the fasting group, the blood values of ADR and NA correlated with each other but not with the DA levels, whereas there was correlation among the urine levels of DA, ADR and NA.

These models have important applications in empirical work. The regions are derived from sufficiency conditions in Bougerol (1993) and take a nonstandard form. We show that the nonstandard shape of the sufficiency regions cannot be avoided by reparameterizing the model or by rescaling the score steps in the transition equation for the correlation parameter. This makes the result markedly different from the volatility case. Observationally equivalent decompositions of the stochastic recurrence equation yield regions with different shapes and sizes. We use these results to establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimator. We illustrate our results with an analysis of time-varying correlations between U.K. and Greek equity indices. We find that also in empirical applications different decompositions can give rise to different conclusions regarding the stability of the estimated model.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/A_stochastic_recurrence_equations_approach_for_score_driven_correlation_models/3179869', [u'Biophysics', u'Environmental Sciences', u'Ecology', u'Immunology', u'Mathematical Sciences'], []]

Sleep disturbance and frequency of short sleeps in 2012 were examined as potential mediators of the associations between WTC in 2010 and subsequent accidents as reported in 2014 (N = 3636). All analyses adjusted for age, sex, education, occupational category, weekly work hours, shift work status, job control and perceived accident risk at work.

It has no biological function and accumulates mainly in metabolically active tissue even at low concentrations, which in turn may cause tissue damage. The effect of Cd on the endocrine systems of fish is not well known. To test the hypothesis that Cd is a chemical stressor, Oreochromis sp. were exposed to waterborne cadmium chloride and their endocrine stress response (plasma cortisol) was investigated after 4\xa0days and 20\xa0days. The plasma cortisol levels were analyzed using reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography with UV detection (\u03bb = 250 nm) after liquid\u2013liquid extraction. The detection limit of the method was found to be 0.87 ng/mL plasma. This study provides evidence that Cd probably causes exhaustion of endocrine systems. Oreochromis sp. exposure to Cd resulted in a 15%\u201353% and 52%\u201391% suppression of cortisol release after 4\xa0days and 20\xa0days of exposure, respectively, in comparison with the control group.

The analyzed rocks include one Sm\xe5land granitoid from north of the Sm\xe5land-Blekinge Deformation Zone (SBDZ), two samples of megacrystic \u201cFilipstad-type\u201d granite from south of that zone and one sample each of the \u201cSm\xe5land-type\u201d R\xf6deby, Alm\xf6, Tjurk\xf6 and J\xe4mj\xf6 granites. The results yield a crystallization age of 1778\xa0\xb1\xa05\xa0Ma for the Sm\xe5land granitoid, and crystallization ages between 1770\xa0\xb1\xa04 and 1758\xa0\xb1\xa05\xa0Ma for the other granitoids, in most cases substantially older than previous TIMS ages. These data show that the \u201cSm\xe5land-type\u201d granitoids in eastern Blekinge are similar in age to the surrounding Tving granitoids, and the more felsic of them may represent late-stage differentiates belonging to the same magmatic suite. As the Tving granitoids show differences both in degree of deformation, in geochemistry and in age, compared to the Sm\xe5land granitoids north of the SBDZ, it is suggested that these represent two separate but closely related igneous suites, which could both be included within a TIB-1 supersuite. The investigated zircons showed very limited signs of metamorphic overprinting, and no metamorphic ages could be determined.

Our new U\u2013Pb zircon ages confirm a Cadomian age and show that the granitic gneiss is ~30\xa0million years older (561.3\xa0\xb1\xa04.7\xa0Ma) than intruding granitoids (522.3\xa0\xb1\xa04.2\xa0Ma; 537.7\xa0\xb1\xa04.7\xa0Ma). Cadomian magmatism in Iran was part of an approximately 100-million-year-long episode of subduction-related arc and back-arc magmatism, which dominated the whole northern Gondwana margin, from Iberia to Turkey and Iran. Major REE and trace element data show that these granitoids have calc-alkaline signatures.

Whole-rock Nd and zircon Hf model ages (1.3\u20131.6\xa0Ga) suggest that this older continental crust was likely to have been Mesoproterozoic or even older. Our results, including variable zircon \u03b5Hf(t) values, inheritance of old zircons and lack of evidence for juvenile Cadomian igneous rocks anywhere in Iran, suggest that the geotectonic setting during late Ediacaran and early Cambrian time was a continental magmatic arc rather than back-arc for the evolution of northeast Iran Cadomian igneous rocks.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Age_and_nature_of_560_520_Ma_calc_alkaline_granitoids_of_Biarjmand_northeast_Iran_insights_into_Cadomian_arc_magmatism_in_northern_Gondwana/3179419', [u'Physical Sciences', u'Neuroscience', u'Physiology', u'Biotechnology', u'Evolutionary Biology', u'Environmental Sciences', u'Chemical Sciences', u'Sociology', u'Cancer', u'Plant Biology'], []]

However, the roles of specific GLR channels to these potentials remain unclear. Here I applied the Electrical Penetration Graph (EPG) to study the contribution of three GLR channels to wound-induced, systemically propagated electrical potentials in Arabidopsis thaliana. In contrast to recordings made with conventional rigs for whole-plant electrophysiology, the EPG allows for the unambiguous distinction of the phloem-propagated action potential (AP) from the electrical activity outside of the phloem. The data reported here suggest that: (a) the transmission of wound-induced, phloem-propagated AP to neighbor leaves, requires expression of GLR3.3 or GLR3.6, whereas GLR3.5 prevents its transmission to non-neighbor leaves; (b) the generation of wound-induced electrical signals outside the phloem network depends on GLR3.6 expression; and (c) wound-induced systemic potentials initiated in the shoot are transmitted to the root in the adult plant, which suggests a role for these electrical signals in coordinating the plant defenses in the shoot and in the root. Here, I propose a model for wound-induced systemic electrical signals at the molecular, cellular and anatomical level. In this model, GLR3.3 and GLR3.6 function as on switches for the propagation of wound-induced potentials beyond the wounded leaf, while GLR3.5 functions as an off switch that prevents the propagation of wound-induced electrical potentials to distal, non-neighbor leaves.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/New_roles_for_the_i_GLUTAMATE_RECEPTOR_LIKE_3_3_3_5_i_and_i_3_6_i_genes_as_on_off_switches_of_wound_induced_systemic_electrical_signals/3113017', [u'Biophysics', u'Biochemistry', u'Cell Biology', u'Genetics', u'Molecular Biology', u'Neuroscience', u'Biotechnology', u'Science Policy', u'Immunology', u'Cancer', u'Mental Health', u'Infectious Diseases', u'Plant Biology'], []]

During the analysis of the post-transcriptional regulation of quorum sensing in the nitrogen fixing plant symbiont Sinorhizobium meliloti, we predicted and verified a direct interaction between the 5'-UTR of sinI mRNA encoding the autoinducer synthase and a small RNA (sRNA), which we named RcsR1. In vitro, RcsR1 prevented cleavage in the 5'-UTR of sinI by RNase E and impaired sinI translation. In line with low ribosomal occupancy and transcript destabilization upon binding of RcsR1 to sinI, overproduction of RcsR1 in S. meliloti resulted in lower level and shorter half-life of sinI mRNA, and in decreased autoinducer amount. Although RcsR1 can influence quorum sensing via sinI, its level did not vary at different cell densities, but decreased under salt stress and increased at low temperature. We found that RcsR1 and its stress-related expression pattern, but not the interaction with sinI homologs, are conserved in Sinorhizobium, Rhizobium and Agrobacterium. Consistently, overproduction of RcsR1 in S. meliloti and Agrobacterium tumefaciens inhibited growth at high salinity. We identified conserved targets of RcsR1 and showed that most conserved interactions and the effect on growth under salt stress are mediated by the first stem-loop of RcsR1, while its central part is responsible for the species-specific interaction with sinI. We conclude that RcsR1 is an ancient, stress-related riboregulator in rhizobia and propose that it links stress responses to quorum sensing in S. meliloti.", u'https://figshare.com/articles/The_stress_related_rhizobial_small_RNA_RcsR1_destabilizes_the_autoinducer_synthase_encoding_mRNA_i_sinI_i_in_i_Sinorhizobium_meliloti_i_/1608860', [u'Microbiology', u'Cell Biology', u'Molecular Biology', u'Ecology', u'Developmental Biology', u'Mental Health', u'Infectious Diseases', u'Plant Biology'], []]

Leukocyte-platelet aggregates play an essential role in linking the hemostatic and immune systems. High shear stress and pro-coagulant and pro-inflammatory stimulants are known to activate platelets and promote the formation of aggregates. Pulsatile blood flow under low shear stress can also induce platelet activation in comparatively mild conditions. However, the effect of such events on leukocyte-platelet aggregates has not yet been investigated. To determine whether low shear stress affects the formation of aggregates, we established a simple \u201cinverting rotation\u201d method of inducing periodic changes in the direction of blood flow in combination with low shear stress. We demonstrated that after the inverting rotation treatment for 10\u201320 min more than 70% of monocytes selectively aggregated with platelets. The formation of monocyte-platelet complexes was inhibited by an anti-CD162 (PSGL-1) monoclonal antibody or a Ca2+ chelator. The phagocytic activity of monocytes was augmented by inverting rotation, whereas phagocytosis mediated by granulocytes remained unaffected. Interestingly, the formation of monocyte-platelet complexes suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2. At the same time, monocyte-platelet complexes augmented the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Our results suggest that platelet-bound monocytes show an anti-inflammatory phenotype under low shear stress conditions.

Split duty schedules offer an alternative to longer shift periods, but introduce additional wake-ups and may therefore increase risk of sleep inertia. This study investigated sleep inertia across a split duty schedule. Sixteen participants (age range 21\u201336 years; 10 females) participated in a 9-day laboratory study with two baseline nights (10 h time in bed, [TIB]), four 24-h periods of a 6-h on/6-h off split duty schedule (5-h TIB in off period; 10-h TIB per 24 h) and two recovery nights. Two complementary rosters were evaluated, with the timing of sleep and wake alternating between the two rosters (2 am/2 pm wake-up roster versus 8 am/8 pm wake-up roster). At 2, 17, 32 and 47 min after scheduled awakening, participants completed an 8-min inertia test bout, which included a 3-min psychomotor vigilance test (PVT-B), a 3-min Digit-Symbol Substitution Task (DSST), the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS), and the Samn\u2013Perelli Fatigue Scale (SP-Fatigue). Further testing occurred every 2 h during scheduled wakefulness. Performance was consistently degraded and subjective sleepiness/fatigue was consistently increased during the inertia testing period as compared to other testing times. Morning wake-ups (2 am and 8 am) were associated with higher levels of sleep inertia than later wake-ups (2 pm and 8 pm). These results suggest that split duty workers should recognise the potential for sleep inertia after waking, especially during the morning hours.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Sleep_inertia_during_a_simulated_6_h_on_6_h_off_fixed_split_duty_schedule/3179245', [u'Medicine', u'Neuroscience', u'Physiology', u'Biotechnology', u'Environmental Sciences', u'Sociology', u'Biological Sciences', u'Science Policy'], []]

SIRT6 is a member of the sirtuin family of NAD+-dependent histone deacetylases, which is responsible for mediating the effects of CR. The transcription factor NF-\u03baB, which is involved in inflammation and aging, has been shown to be regulated by SIRT6. Here we describe the crucial role of SIRT6 in aging and inflammation. We show that CR had improved renal insufficiency and enhanced SIRT6 expression after 6-month treatment in aged mice. Culture cells in low glucose (LG) conditions also showed resistance to cell senescence and enhanced SIRT6 expression compared to normal glucose (NG) group, showing beneficial effects of the CR-mimic cultural conditions. Moreover, SIRT6 overexpression is sufficient to delay the replicative senescence of WI38 by attenuating NF-\u03baB signaling, while SIRT6 knockdown results in accelerated cell senescence and overactive NF-\u03baB signaling.

Our findings indicate that systemic exposure (\u22652\u2009mg/kg) was associated with acute liver injury due to preferential accumulation of NP in this organ and resulted in elevated AST, ALT and LDH levels. Moreover, within 24\u2009h of NP administration, there was a dose-dependent increase in intraperitoneal neutrophil recruitment and upregulation in gene expression of several proinflammatory mediators, including TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and S100A9. Histological analysis of liver tissue revealed evidence of dose-dependent hepatocyte necrosis, increase in sinusoidal Kupffer cells, lobular granulomas and foci of abscess formation which were most pronounced at 24\u2009h following NP administration.

Recent research and development has enabled the industrial use of E. gracilis and selective breeding of this species is expected to further expand its application. However, the production of E. gracilis nuclear mutants is difficult because of the robustness of its genome. To establish an efficient mutation induction procedure for E. gracilis, we employed Fe-ion beam irradiation in the RIKEN RI beam factory. A decrease in the survival rate was observed with the increase in irradiation dose, and the upper limit used for E. gracilis selective breeding was around 50\xa0Gy. For a practical trial of Fe-ion irradiation, we conducted a screening to isolate high-temperature-tolerant mutants. The screening yielded mutants that proliferated faster than the wild-type strain at 32\u2009\xb0C.

Adeniyi', 'Mahmoud E.S. Soliman', 'Tahir S. Pillay'], u'2016-04-14T08:54:53Z', u'Several naturally occuring mutations in the human insulin gene are associated with diabetes mellitus. The three known mutant molecules, Wakayama, Los Angeles and Chicago were evaluated using molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) to analyse mechanisms of deprived binding affinity for insulin receptor (IR). Insulin Wakayama, is a variant in which valine at position A3 is substituted by leucine, while in insulin Los Angeles and Chicago, phenylalanine at positions B24 and B25 is replaced by serine and leucine, respectively. These mutations show radical changes in binding affinity for IR. The ZDOCK server was used for molecular docking, while AMBER 14 was used for the MD study. The published crystal structure of IR bound to natural insulin was also used for MD. The binding interactions and MD trajectories clearly explained the critical factors for deprived binding to the IR. The surface area around position A3 was increased when valine was substituted by leucine, while at positions B24 and B25 aromatic amino acid phenylalanine replaced by non-aromatic serine and leucine might be responsible for fewer binding interactions at the binding site of IR that leads to instability of the complex. In the MD simulation, the normal mode analysis, rmsd trajectories and prediction of fluctuation indicated instability of complexes with mutant insulin in order of insulin native insulin\xa0<\xa0insulin Chicago\xa0<\xa0insulin Los Angeles\xa0<\xa0insulin Wakayama molecules which corresponds to the biological evidence of the differing affinities of the mutant insulins for the IR.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Diabetes_mellitus_caused_by_mutations_in_human_insulin_analysis_of_impaired_receptor_binding_of_insulins_i_Wakayama_i_i_Los_Angeles_i_and_i_Chicago_i_using_pharmacoinformatics/3178483', [u'Biophysics', u'Biochemistry', u'Genetics', u'Molecular Biology', u'Biotechnology', u'Chemical Sciences', u'Infectious Diseases', u'Virology', u'Computational  Biology'], []]

The aim here was to further evolve this model to mimic the stratum corneum in a compromised skin barrier by reducing the barrier functions in a controlled manner. Methods: To mimic compromised skin barriers, PVPA barriers were prepared with explicitly defined reduced barrier function and compared with literature data from both human and animal skin with compromised barrier properties. Caffeine, diclofenac sodium, chloramphenicol and the hydrophilic marker calcein were tested to compare the PVPA models with established models. Results and discussions: The established PVPA models mimicking the stratum corneum in healthy skin showed good correlation with biological barriers by ranking drugs similar to those ranked by the pig ear skin model and were comparable to literature data on permeation through healthy human skin. The PVPA models provided reproducible and consistent results with a distinction between the barriers mimicking compromised and healthy skin. The trends in increasing drug permeation with an increasing degree of compromised barriers for the model drugs were similar to the literature data from other in vivo and in vitro models. Conclusions: The PVPA models have the potential to provide permeation predictions when investigating drugs or cosmeceuticals intended for various compromised skin conditions and can thus possibly reduce the time and cost of testing as well as the use of animal testing in the early development of drug candidates, drugs and cosmeceuticals.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/_i_In_vitro_i_models_to_estimate_drug_penetration_through_the_compromised_i_stratum_corneum_i_barrier/3175636', [u'Medicine', u'Genetics', u'Physiology', u'Pharmacology', u'Environmental Sciences', u'Ecology', u'Biological Sciences'], []]

Endophytes isolated from medicinal plants have been attracting considerable attention due to their high biodiversity and their predicted potential to produce a plethora of novel compounds. In this study, an attempt was made to isolate endophytes from rhizomes of five medicinal plants of Zingiberaceae family, and to screen the endophytes for L-asparaginase activity. In total, 50 endophytes (14 bacteria, 22 actinomycetes, and 14 fungi) were isolated from Alpinia galanga, Curcuma amada, Curcuma longa, Hedychium coronarium, and Zingiber officinale; of these, 31 endophytes evidenced positive for L-asparaginase production. All the L-asparaginase-positive isolates showed L-asparaginase activity in the range of 54.17\u2013155.93\xa0U/mL in unoptimized medium. An endophytic fungus isolated from Curcuma amada, identified as Talaromyces pinophilus, was used for further experiments involving studies on the effect of certain nutritional and nonnutritional factors on L-asparaginase production in submerged fermentation. Talaromyces pinophilus initially gave an enzyme activity of 108.95\xa0U/mL, but gradually reduced to 80\xa0U/mL due to strain degeneration.

Khare'], u'2016-04-13T15:56:56Z', u'Halophiles have been perceived as potential source of novel enzymes in recent years. The interest emanates from their ability to catalyze efficiently under high salt and organic solvents. Marinobacter sp. EMB8 \u03b1-amylase was found to be active and stable in salt and organic solvents. A study was carried out using circular dichroism (CD), fluorescence spectroscopy, and bioinformatics analysis of similar protein sequence to ascertain molecular basis of salt and solvent adaptability of \u03b1-amylase. Structural changes recorded in the presence of varying amounts of NaCl exhibited an increase in negative ellipticity as a function of salt, confirming that salt stabilizes the protein and increases the secondary structure, making it catalytically functional. The data of intrinsic and extrinsic fluorescence (using 1-anilinonaphthalene 8-sulfonate [ANS] as probe) further confirmed the role of salt. The \u03b1-amylase was active in the presence of nonpolar solvents, namely, hexane and decane, but inactivated by ethanol. The decrease in the activity was correlated with the loss of tertiary structure in the presence of ethanol. Guanidine hydrochloride and pH denaturation indicated the molten globule state at pH 4.0. Partial N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified \u03b1-amylase revealed the relatedness to Pseudoalteromonas sp. \u03b1-amylase. \u201cFVHLFEW\u201d was found as the N-terminal signature sequence. Bioinformatics analysis was done using M. algicola \u03b1-amylase protein having the same N-terminal signature sequence. The three-dimensional structure of Marinobacter \u03b1-amylase was deduced using the I-TASSER server, which reflected the enrichment of acidic amino acids on the surface, imparting the stability in the presence of salt. Our study clearly indicate that salt is necessary for maintaining the secondary and tertiary structure of halophilic protein, which is a necessary prerequisite for catalysis.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Structural_elucidation_and_molecular_characterization_of_i_Marinobacter_i_sp_amylase/3175138', [u'Biophysics', u'Biochemistry', u'Microbiology', u'Molecular Biology', u'Biotechnology', u'Chemical Sciences', u'Biological Sciences', u'Inorganic Chemistry'], []]

We analyzed CpG-related SNP allele frequencies in whole genome sequences (WGS) across five TCGA cancer datasets, thereby exploiting a more recent appreciation for signaling pathway degeneracy in cancer. The cancer datasets were analyzed for SNPs in CpG islands associated with the oncogenes, HRAS and MYC, and in the CpG islands associated with the tumor suppressor genes, APC, DCC, and RB1. We determined that one SNP allele (rs3824120) in a CpG island associated with MYC which that eliminated a CpG was more common in the cancer datasets than in the 1000Genomes databases (p < 0.01). For HRAS, two SNP alleles (rs112690925, rs7939028) that created CpG's occurred significantly less frequently in the cancer datasets than in the general SNP databases (e.g., rs7939028, p < 0.0002, in comparison with AllSNPs(142)). Also, one SNP allele (rs4940177) that created a CpG in a CpG island associated with the DCC tumor suppressor gene, was more common in the cancer datasets (p < 0.0007). To understand a broader picture of the potential of SNP alleles to create CpG's in CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes, we developed a scripted algorithm to assess the SNP alleles associated with the CpG islands of forty-three tumor suppressor genes.

Cellular senescence is observed in CAFs treated with H2O2 as shown by elevated SA-\u03b2-gal activity and p21 (WAF1/Cip1) protein levels. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and p21 (WAF1/Cip1) elevation may account for H2O2-induced CAFs cell cycle arrest in S phase. Blockage of autophagy can increase ROS production in CAFs, leading to cell cycle arrest in S phase, cell proliferation inhibition and enhanced sensitivity to H2O2-induced cell death. ROS scavenger NAC can reduce ROS production and thus restore cell viability. Lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), monocarboxylic acid transporter 4 (MCT4) and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) were up-regulated in CAFs compared with NFs. There was relatively high lactate content in CAFs than in NFs. Blockage of autophagy decreased LDHA, MCT4 and SOD2 protein levels in CAFs that might enhance ROS production.

[u'A Simple Generic Model for Estimating Saturated Vapor Pressure', ['Aliakbar Roosta', 'Javad Hekayati'], u'2016-04-13T15:41:44Z', u'Arguably, the most important of the basic thermodynamic properties of fluids, vapor pressure has been the focus of investigation for over a century. The two main drawbacks of the models currently used for its correlation are that they either exhibit large deviations near critical temperature and triple point or that they have a large number of compound-specific adjusted parameters and hence the inconvenient necessity of having at hand large tabulations of hundreds of model parameters. In this study, by employing the up and coming procedure of genetic programming, a new model, which to a large extent remedies these shortcomings, is proposed. Essentially, having only two compound-specific adjusted parameters and also using two readily available substance parameters of molecular weight and normal boiling point ensure a high level of convenience, yet precision and applicability over a large portion of the vapor\u2013liquid coexistence curve. Concisely, a sizable database comprised of 58,272 data points was gathered for 243 organic and inorganic compounds and elements belonging to a diverse set of chemical families; these were then used in both developing and validating the proposed model and reporting generic and compound/element-specific adjusted parameters.

To inform targeted prehospital care development in Ghana, we aimed to describe spatial access to formal prehospital care services and identify ambulance stations for capacity expansion. Methods: Cost distance methods were used to evaluate areal and population-level access to prehospital care within 30 and 60 minutes of each of the 128 ambulance stations in Ghana. With network analysis methods, a two-step floating catchment area model was created to identify district-level variability in access. Districts without NAS stations within their catchment areas were identified as candidates for an additional NAS station. Additionally, five candidate stations for capacity expansion (e.g., addition of an ambulance) were then identified through iterative simulations that were designed to identify the stations that had the greatest influence on the access scores of the ten lowest access districts. Results: Following NAS inception, the proportion of Ghana's landmass serviceable within 60 minutes of a station increased from 8.7 to 59.4% from 2004 to 2014, respectively. Over the same time period, the proportion of the population with access to the NAS within 60-minutes increased from 48% to 79%. The two-step floating catchment area model identified considerable variation in district-level access scores, which ranged from 0.05 to 2.43 ambulances per 100,000 persons (median 0.45; interquartile range 0.23-0.63). Seven candidate districts for NAS station addition and five candidate NAS stations for capacity expansion were identified. The addition of one ambulance to each of the five candidate stations improved access scores in the ten lowest access districts by a total 0.22 ambulances per 100,000 persons. Conclusions: The NAS in Ghana has expanded its population-level spatial access to the majority of the population; however, access inequality exists in both rural and urban areas that can be improved by increasing station capacity or adding additional stations.

This study presents the HTL conversion of a microalgae Chlorella sp. bacteria consortium using a batch type reactor. The experiments were carried out using a full factorial experimental design approach, where the main chosen factors were the temperature, the residence time at maximum temperature and the dry-matter-to-water ratio. The biocrude oil is the targeted product characterized along this work; its production and its composition were studied. The yields of biocrudes approach other microalgae studies using pure strains of microalgae and batch-type reactors. Maximum yields (37%daf) and lowest O/C ratio (0.167) were obtained at the highest severity conditions (310\u2009\xb0C for 55\xa0min and 0.15 dry-matter-to-water ratio). The energy return on energy invested (EROEI) of the process has been determined. The simulated distillation by thermogravimetric analysis (Sim-Dis-TGA) was conducted on the different obtained biocrude and no significant effect was observed with respect to five evaporation ranges among the studied conditions.

RVCs are regions where the velocities of the robot are constrained to predefined values. Inside the RVCs, the robot has to reduce its translational velocity to avoid predicted hazards such as collisions with obstacles, and to reduce its rotational velocity to prevent undesirable motions such as sharp turns. We also propose a motion planning method for navigating the mobile robot in an environment with RVCs based on the Navigation Function and Global Dynamic Window Approach. Our method generates a trajectory satisfying both translational and rotational velocity constraints to be compatible with the surroundings.

The UK Green Deal, while slow to start, was gaining momentum before it was effectively ended. Semi-structured interviews with programme organizers give evidence that the Green Deal would have benefited from a more active approach to marketing and outreach, specifically emphasizing the distinction between the two. Marketing generates interest, but local outreach through word of mouth and personal referrals is needed to drive upgrades. The Green Deal did not sufficiently engage the workforce through an ongoing communication strategy and should have better facilitated both technical and non-technical skills development. The interest rate of the Green Deal is shown to be but one factor influencing participation, and can be effectively balanced through programme design in other areas.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Lessons_for_the_UK_Green_Deal_from_the_US_BBNP/3172828', [u'Biological Sciences', u'Science Policy', u'Mental Health'], []]

[u'Range Expansion of Moose in Arctic Alaska Linked to Warming and Increased Shrub Habitat - Fig 2', ['Ken D. Tape', 'David D. Gustine', 'Roger W. Ruess', 'Layne G. Adams', 'Jason A. Clark'], u'2016-04-14T06:03:37Z', u'Estimated changes in moose habitat in Arctic Alaska since 1860, including changes in riparian shrub height (a, b) and shrub canopy volume (c, d). Moose require shrubs protruding above the snow in late winter for habitat [b; adapted from [12]], and the shrub height hindcasting (a) indicates that little to no habitat would have existed in Arctic Alaska c. 1860 (a, b). The blue shrub height line (a) uses an average of previous 10 years of thaw degree days to predict shrub height (Eq 1); shaded area indicates the 95% confidence interval; predicted height is consistent with measured shrub heights in 2010 (black box). The blue shrub height line uses interpolated observed temperatures, whereas the red line uses temperatures hindcasted from an average of the five highest-performing General Circulation Models [34]. The mean July temperatures of the late 1800s and early 1900s (solid line is average of previous 10 yrs) were less than 11.8\xb0C (c), indicating that willow canopy volumes would have been greatly reduced (d), consistent with the absence of moose during that period (S1 & S2 Appendices). Temperature sensitivity of shrub canopy volume for Salix richardsonii, the species used to construct (a), is similar to that for the preferred forage species of moose, Salix alaxensis (d; reproduced from [36]).', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Range_Expansion_of_Moose_in_Arctic_Alaska_Linked_to_Warming_and_Increased_Shrub_Habitat_Fig_2/3178408', [u'Cell Biology', u'Environmental Sciences', u'Ecology', u'Biological Sciences', u'Plant Biology'], []]
[u'Range Expansion of Moose in Arctic Alaska Linked to Warming and Increased Shrub Habitat', ['Ken D. Tape', 'David D. Gustine', 'Roger W. Ruess', 'Layne G. Adams', 'Jason A. Clark'], u'2016-04-14T06:03:26Z', u'Twentieth century warming has increased vegetation productivity and shrub cover across northern tundra and treeline regions, but effects on terrestrial wildlife have not been demonstrated on a comparable scale. During this period, Alaskan moose (Alces alces gigas) extended their range from the boreal forest into tundra riparian shrub habitat; similar extensions have been observed in Canada (A. a. andersoni) and Eurasia (A. a. alces). Northern moose distribution is thought to be limited by forage availability above the snow in late winter, so the observed increase in shrub habitat could be causing the northward moose establishment, but a previous hypothesis suggested that hunting cessation triggered moose establishment. Here, we use recent changes in shrub cover and empirical relationships between shrub height and growing season temperature to estimate available moose habitat in Arctic Alaska c. 1860. We estimate that riparian shrubs were approximately 1.1 m tall c. 1860, greatly reducing the available forage above the snowpack, compared to 2 m tall in 2009. We believe that increases in riparian shrub habitat after 1860 allowed moose to colonize tundra regions of Alaska hundreds of kilometers north and west of previous distribution limits. The northern shift in the distribution of moose, like that of snowshoe hares, has been in response to the spread of their shrub habitat in the Arctic, but at the same time, herbivores have likely had pronounced impacts on the structure and function of these shrub communities. These northward range shifts are a bellwether for other boreal species and their associated predators.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Range_Expansion_of_Moose_in_Arctic_Alaska_Linked_to_Warming_and_Increased_Shrub_Habitat/3178384', [u'Cell Biology', u'Environmental Sciences', u'Ecology', u'Biological Sciences', u'Plant Biology'], []]

[u'Human Milk Cells and Lipids Conserve Numerous Known and Novel miRNAs, Some of Which Are Differentially Expressed during Lactation', ['Mohammed Alsaweed', 'Ching Tat Lai', 'Peter E. Hartmann', 'Donna T. Geddes', 'Foteini Kakulas'], u'2016-04-14T06:03:03Z', u'Human milk (HM) is rich in miRNAs, which are thought to contribute to infant protection and development. We used deep sequencing to profile miRNAs in the cell and lipid fractions of HM obtained post-feeding from 10 lactating women in months 2, 4, and 6 postpartum. In both HM fractions, 1,195 mature known miRNAs were identified, which were positively associated with the cell (p = 0.048) and lipid (p = 0.010) content of HM. An additional 5,167 novel miRNA species were predicted, of which 235 were high-confidence miRNAs. HM cells contained more known miRNAs than HM lipids (1,136 and 835 respectively, p<0.001). Although the profile of the novel miRNAs was very different between cells and lipids, with the majority conserved in the cell fraction and being mother-specific, 2/3 of the known miRNAs common between cells and lipids were similarly expressed (p>0.05). Great similarities between the two HM fractions were also found in the profile of the top 20 known miRNAs. These were largely similar also between the three lactation stages examined, as were the total miRNA concentration, and the number and expression of the known miRNAs common between cells and lipids (p>0.05). Yet, approximately a third of all known miRNAs were differentially expressed during the first 6 months of lactation (p<0.05), with more pronounced miRNA upregulation seen in month 4. These findings indicate that although the total miRNA concentration of HM cells and lipids provided to the infant does not change in first 6 months of lactation, the miRNA composition is altered, particularly in month 4 compared to months 2 and 6. This may reflect the remodeling of the gland in response to infant feeding patterns, which usually change after exclusive breastfeeding, suggesting adaptation to the infant\u2019s needs.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Human_Milk_Cells_and_Lipids_Conserve_Numerous_Known_and_Novel_miRNAs_Some_of_Which_Are_Differentially_Expressed_during_Lactation/3178339', [u'Biophysics', u'Biochemistry', u'Physical Sciences', u'Microbiology', u'Cell Biology', u'Genetics', u'Molecular Biology', u'Biotechnology', u'Chemical Sciences', u'Developmental Biology', u'Cancer', u'Hematology', u'Computational  Biology'], []]

This typifies the vast heterogeneity of this tumor with the two extremes represented on one end by the glioma stemlike cells (GSC) and on the other by the glioma differentiated cells (GDC). Interestingly, GSC are more sensitive to immune effector cells than the GDC counterpart. However, how GSC impact on the killing on the GDC and vice versa is not clear. Using a newly developed cytotoxicity assay allowing to simultaneously monitor cytotoxic lymphocytes-mediated killing of GSC and GDC, we found that although GSC were always better killed and that their presence enhanced the killing of GDC. In contrast, an excess of GDC had a mild protective effect on the killing of GSC, depending on the CTL type. Overall, our results suggest that during combination therapy, immunotherapy would be the most effective after prior treatment with conventional therapies.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Glioma_Stemlike_Cells_Enhance_the_Killing_of_Glioma_Differentiated_Cells_by_Cytotoxic_Lymphocytes/3178210', [u'Space Science', u'Microbiology', u'Cell Biology', u'Genetics', u'Pharmacology', u'Biotechnology', u'Ecology', u'Immunology', u'Biological Sciences', u'Developmental Biology', u'Cancer'], []]

This has supported hypotheses of dinosaur provinciality and endemism in the Late Cretaceous with the delineation of at least two separate faunal zones, north and south Laramidia. There have been 12 genera of centrosaurines recognized from northern Laramidia while two genera, Diabloceratops and Nasutoceratops, have been named from southern Laramidia. We present an osteological description and taphonomic outline for a new centrosaurine ceratopsid from the Aguja Formation of northern Coahuila, Mexico that is not currently diagnosable to the generic level, but likely represents a new taxon. Further, we have included three-dimensional surface scans of all material attributed to this animal. Considering the large number of centrosaurines from northern Laramidia, it is likely that cladistic analyses are biased towards this faunal zone. New findings of southern centrosaurines are needed to correct this bias. This discovery expands the range of centrosaurines south to Coahuila, Mexico and adds new information to better characterize the morphology and taxonomy of centrosaurines from southern Laramidia and their evolution in comparison to their northern counterparts.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/A_Centrosaurine_Dinosauria_Ceratopsia_from_the_Aguja_Formation_Late_Campanian_of_Northern_Coahuila_Mexico/3178282', [u'Molecular Biology', u'Evolutionary Biology', u'Environmental Sciences', u'Ecology', u'Biological Sciences', u'Infectious Diseases'], []]

It is one of the most extensive and sedimentologically dynamic regions of the world, with a large number of continental islands mostly formed less than 10,000 years ago. The natural distribution of the cane toad (Rhinella marina), one of the world\u2019s most successful invasive species, in this complex Amazonian system provides an intriguing model for the investigation of the effects of isolation or the combined effects of isolation and habitat dynamic changes on patterns of genetic variability and population differentiation. We used nine fast-evolving microsatellite loci to contrast patterns of genetic variability in six coastal (three mainlands and three islands) populations of the cane toad near the mouth of the Amazon River. Results from Bayesian multilocus clustering approach and Discriminant Analyses of Principal Component were congruent in showing that each island population was genetically differentiated from the mainland populations. All FST values obtained from all pairwise comparisons were significant, ranging from 0.048 to 0.186. Estimates of both recent and historical gene flow were not significantly different from zero across all population pairs, except the two mainland populations inhabiting continuous habitats. Patterns of population differentiation, with a high level of population substructure and absence/restricted gene flow, suggested that island populations of R. marina are likely isolated since the Holocene sea-level rise. However, considering the similar levels of genetic variability found in both island and mainland populations, it is reliable to assume that they were also isolated for longer periods. Given the genetic uniqueness of each cane toad population, together with the high natural vulnerability of the coastal regions and intense human pressures, we suggest that these populations should be treated as discrete units for conservation management purposes.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Patterns_of_Genetic_Variability_in_Island_Populations_of_the_Cane_Toad_i_Rhinella_marina_i_from_the_Mouth_of_the_Amazon/3178045', [u'Genetics', u'Evolutionary Biology', u'Environmental Sciences', u'Ecology', u'Biological Sciences', u'Inorganic Chemistry'], []]

Studies evaluating Genomic Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (GBLUP) models including dominance effects have not been performed in the univariate and multivariate context in the data analysis of this crop. A single cross hybrid construction procedure was performed in this study using phenotypic data and actual molecular markers of 4,091 maize lines from the public database Panzea. A total of 400 simple hybrids resulting from this process were analyzed using the univariate and multivariate GBLUP model considering only additive effects additive plus dominance effects. Historic heritability scenarios of five traits and other genetic architecture settings were used to compare models, evaluating the predictive ability and estimation of variance components. Marginal differences were detected between the multivariate and univariate models. The main explanation for the small discrepancy between models is the low- to moderate-magnitude correlations between the traits studied and moderate heritabilities. These conditions do not favor the advantages of multivariate analysis. The inclusion of dominance effects in the models was an efficient strategy to improve the predictive ability and estimation quality of variance components.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Inclusion_of_Dominance_Effects_in_the_Multivariate_GBLUP_Model/3178069', [u'Genetics', u'Biotechnology', u'Environmental Sciences', u'Ecology', u'Biological Sciences', u'Mathematical Sciences', u'Science Policy'], []]

[u'Searching for Survivors through Random Human-Body Movement Outdoors by Continuous-Wave Radar Array', ['Chuantao Li', 'Fuming Chen', 'Fugui Qi', 'Miao Liu', 'Zhao Li', 'Fulai Liang', 'Xijing Jing', 'Guohua Lu', 'Jianqi Wang'], u'2016-04-14T06:00:34Z', u'It is a major challenge to search for survivors after chemical or nuclear leakage or explosions. At present, biological radar can be used to achieve this goal by detecting the survivor\u2019s respiration signal. However, owing to the random posture of an injured person at a rescue site, the radar wave may directly irradiate the person\u2019s head or feet, in which it is difficult to detect the respiration signal. This paper describes a multichannel-based antenna array technology, which forms an omnidirectional detection system via 24-GHz Doppler biological radar, to address the random positioning relative to the antenna of an object to be detected. Furthermore, since the survivors often have random body movement such as struggling and twitching, the slight movements of the body caused by breathing are obscured by these movements. Therefore, a method is proposed to identify random human-body movement by utilizing multichannel information to calculate the background variance of the environment in combination with a constant-false-alarm-rate detector. The conducted outdoor experiments indicate that the system can realize the omnidirectional detection of random human-body movement and distinguish body movement from environmental interference such as movement of leaves and grass. The methods proposed in this paper will be a promising way to search for survivors outdoors.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Searching_for_Survivors_through_Random_Human_Body_Movement_Outdoors_by_Continuous_Wave_Radar_Array/3178015', [u'Ecology', u'Biological Sciences', u'Mathematical Sciences', u'Cancer'], []]

[u'A New Font, Specifically Designed for Peripheral Vision, Improves Peripheral Letter and Word Recognition, but Not Eye-Mediated Reading Performance', ['Jean-Baptiste Bernard', 'Carlos Aguilar', 'Eric Castet'], u'2016-04-14T06:00:13Z', u'Reading speed is dramatically reduced when readers cannot use their central vision. This is because low visual acuity and crowding negatively impact letter recognition in the periphery. In this study, we designed a new font (referred to as the Eido font) in order to reduce inter-letter similarity and consequently to increase peripheral letter recognition performance. We tested this font by running five experiments that compared the Eido font with the standard Courier font. Letter spacing and x-height were identical for the two monospaced fonts. Six normally-sighted subjects used exclusively their peripheral vision to run two aloud reading tasks (with eye movements), a letter recognition task (without eye movements), a word recognition task (without eye movements) and a lexical decision task. Results show that reading speed was not significantly different between the Eido and the Courier font when subjects had to read single sentences with a round simulated gaze-contingent central scotoma (10\xb0 diameter). In contrast, Eido significantly decreased perceptual errors in peripheral crowded letter recognition (-30% errors on average for letters briefly presented at 6\xb0 eccentricity) and in peripheral word recognition (-32% errors on average for words briefly presented at 6\xb0 eccentricity).', u'https://figshare.com/articles/A_New_Font_Specifically_Designed_for_Peripheral_Vision_Improves_Peripheral_Letter_and_Word_Recognition_but_Not_Eye_Mediated_Reading_Performance/3177961', [u'Medicine', u'Neuroscience', u'Sociology', u'Biological Sciences', u'Science Policy', u'Mental Health'], []]

The biogenesis of mitochondria relies on the assembly of \u03b2-barrel proteins into the mitochondrial outer membrane, a process inherited from the bacterial ancestor. Caulobacter crescentus is an \u03b1-proteobacterium, and the BAM (\u03b2-barrel assembly machinery) complex was purified and characterized from this model organism. Like the mitochondrial sorting and assembly machinery complex, we find the BAM complex to be modular in nature. A \u223c150 kDa core BAM complex containing BamA, BamB, BamD, and BamE associates with additional modules in the outer membrane. One of these modules, Pal, is a lipoprotein that provides a means for anchorage to the peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall. We suggest the modular design of the BAM complex facilitates access to substrates from the protein translocase in the inner membrane.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/A_Modular_BAM_Complex_in_the_Outer_Membrane_of_the_Proteobacterium_em_Caulobacter_crescentus_em_/145088', [u'Cell Biology', u'Biochemistry'], []]

Recent studies indicate that proteins that contain PPIase activity can also alter the processing of Alzheimer's Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP). Originally identified in hematopoietic cells, FKBP52 is much more abundantly expressed in neurons, including the hippocampus, frontal cortex, and basal ganglia. Given the fact that the high molecular weight immunophilin FKBP52 is highly expressed in CNS regions susceptible to Alzheimer's, we investigated its role in A\u03b2 toxicity. Towards this goal, we generated A\u03b2 transgenic Drosophila that harbor gain of function or loss of function mutations of FKBP52. FKBP52 overexpression reduced the toxicity of A\u03b2 and increased lifespan in A\u03b2 flies, whereas loss of function of FKBP52 exacerbated these A\u03b2 phenotypes. Interestingly, the A\u03b2 pathology was enhanced by mutations in the copper transporters Atox1, which interacts with FKBP52, and Ctr1A and was suppressed in FKBP52 mutant flies raised on a copper chelator diet. Using mammalian cultures, we show that FKBP52 (\u2212/\u2212) cells have increased intracellular copper and higher levels of A\u03b2. This effect is reversed by reconstitution of FKBP52. Finally, we also found that FKBP52 formed stable complexes with APP through its FK506 interacting domain. Taken together, these studies identify a novel role for FKBP52 in modulating toxicity of A\u03b2 peptides.", u'https://figshare.com/articles/Control_of_Alzheimer_s_Amyloid_Beta_Toxicity_by_the_High_Molecular_Weight_Immunophilin_FKBP52_and_Copper_Homeostasis_in_em_Drosophila_em_/145058', [u'Cell Biology', u'Neuroscience', u'Molecular Biology'], []]

The presence of the ApoE4 isoform is considered to be a contributing risk factor for AD. However, the detailed molecular properties of ApoE4 interacting with the A\u03b2 peptide are unknown, although various mechanisms have been proposed to explain the physiological and pathological role of this relationship. Here, computer simulations have been used to investigate the process of A\u03b2 interaction with the N-terminal domain of the human ApoE isoforms (ApoE2, ApoE3 and ApoE4). Molecular docking combined with molecular dynamics simulations have been undertaken to determine the A\u03b2 peptide binding sites and the relative stability of binding to each of the ApoE isoforms. Our results show that from the several ApoE isoforms investigated, only ApoE4 presents a misfolded intermediate when bound to A\u03b2. Moreover, the initial \u03b1-helix used as the A\u03b2 peptide model structure also becomes unstructured due to the interaction with ApoE4. These structural changes appear to be related to a rearrangement of the salt bridge network in ApoE4, for which we propose a model. It seems plausible that ApoE4 in its partially unfolded state is incapable of performing the clearance of A\u03b2, thereby promoting amyloid forming processes. Hence, the proposed model can be used to identify potential drug binding sites in the ApoE4-A\u03b2 complex, where the interaction between the two molecules can be inhibited.", u'https://figshare.com/articles/_em_In_Silico_em_Analysis_of_the_Apolipoprotein_E_and_the_Amyloid_em_em_Peptide_Interaction_Misfolding_Induced_by_Frustration_of_the_Salt_Bridge_Network/144679', [u'Biological Sciences', u'Neuroscience'], []]

The \u201cinsight\u201d hypothesis claims that this complex behaviour is based on cognitive abilities such as mental scenario building and imagination. An operant conditioning account, in contrast, would claim that this spontaneity is due to each action in string pulling being reinforced by the meat moving closer and remaining closer to the bird on the perch. We presented experienced and na\xefve New Caledonian crows with a novel, visually restricted string-pulling problem that reduced the quality of visual feedback during string pulling. Experienced crows solved this problem with reduced efficiency and increased errors compared to their performance in standard string pulling. Na\xefve crows either failed or solved the problem by trial and error learning. However, when visual feedback was available via a mirror mounted next to the apparatus, two na\xefve crows were able to perform at the same level as the experienced group.

This hypothetical gene can account for higher incidence of right-handers in those with left cerebral dominance for speech. It remains unclear how this dominance relates to the right-cerebral dominance for some nonverbal functions such as spatial or emotional processing. Here we use functional magnetic resonance imaging with a sample of 155 subjects to measure asymmetrical activation induced by speech production in the frontal lobes, by face processing in the temporal lobes, and by spatial processing in the parietal lobes. Left-frontal, right-temporal, and right-parietal dominance were all intercorrelated, suggesting that right-cerebral biases may be at least in part complementary to the left-hemispheric dominance for language. However, handedness and parietal asymmetry for spatial processing were uncorrelated, implying independent lateralizing processes, one producing a leftward bias most closely associated with handedness, and the other a rightward bias most closely associated with spatial attention.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Cerebral_Asymmetries_Complementary_and_Independent_Processes/144247', [u'Neuroscience'], []]

Likic', 'Jung Hock Foo', 'Miroslava Sedinova', 'Jan Tachezy', 'Anna Bachmann', 'Iris Bruchhaus', 'Trevor Lithgow'], u'2010-03-19T01:09:37Z', u'Several essential biochemical processes are situated in mitochondria. The metabolic transformation of mitochondria in distinct lineages of eukaryotes created proteomes ranging from thousands of proteins to what appear to be a much simpler scenario. In the case of Entamoeba histolytica, tiny mitochondria known as mitosomes have undergone extreme reduction. Only recently a single complete metabolic pathway of sulfate activation has been identified in these organelles. The E. histolytica mitosomes do not produce ATP needed for the sulfate activation pathway and for three molecular chaperones, Cpn60, Cpn10 and mtHsp70. The already characterized ADP/ATP carrier would thus be essential to provide cytosolic ATP for these processes, but how the equilibrium of inorganic phosphate could be maintained was unknown. Finally, how the mitosomal proteins are translocated to the mitosomes had remained unclear. We used a hidden Markov model (HMM) based search of the E. histolytica genome sequence to discover candidate (i) mitosomal phosphate carrier complementing the activity of the ADP/ATP carrier and (ii) membrane-located components of the protein import machinery that includes the outer membrane translocation channel Tom40 and membrane assembly protein Sam50. Using in vitro and in vivo systems we show that E. histolytica contains a minimalist set up of the core import components in order to accommodate a handful of mitosomal proteins. The anaerobic and parasitic lifestyle of E. histolytica has produced one of the simplest known mitochondrial compartments of all eukaryotes. Comparisons with mitochondria of another amoeba, Dictystelium discoideum, emphasize just how dramatic the reduction of the protein import apparatus was after the loss of archetypal mitochondrial functions in the mitosomes of E. histolytica.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/The_Essentials_of_Protein_Import_in_the_Degenerate_Mitochondrion_of_em_Entamoeba_histolytica_em_/144177', [u'Cell Biology', u'Evolutionary Biology', u'Microbiology'], []]

Using the CAMARADES (Collaborative Approach to Meta-analysis and Review of Animal Data in Experimental Studies) database we identified 16 systematic reviews of interventions tested in animal studies of acute ischaemic stroke involving 525 unique publications. Only ten publications (2%) reported no significant effects on infarct volume and only six (1.2%) did not report at least one significant finding. Egger regression and trim-and-fill analysis suggested that publication bias was highly prevalent (present in the literature for 16 and ten interventions, respectively) in animal studies modelling stroke. Trim-and-fill analysis suggested that publication bias might account for around one-third of the efficacy reported in systematic reviews, with reported efficacy falling from 31.3% to 23.8% after adjustment for publication bias. We estimate that a further 214 experiments (in addition to the 1,359 identified through rigorous systematic review; non publication rate 14%) have been conducted but not reported.

In the absence of type I IFN priming, cells display attenuated responses to other cytokines, such as anti-viral protection in response to IFN\u03b3. This phenomenon was proposed to be because IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor1 (IFNAR1) is a component of the IFN\u03b3 receptor (IFNGR), but our new data are more consistent with a previously proposed model indicating that regulated expression of STAT1 may also play a critical role in the priming process. Initially, we noticed that DNA binding activity of STAT1 was attenuated in c-Jun\u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts because they expressed lower levels of STAT1 than wild-type cells. However, expression of STAT1 was rescued by culturing c-Jun\u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts in media conditioned by wild-type fibroblasts suggesting they secreted a STAT1-inducing factor. The STAT1-inducing factor in fibroblast-conditioned media was IFN\u03b2, as it was inhibited by antibodies to IFNAR1, or when IFN\u03b2 expression was knocked down in wild-type cells. IFNAR1\u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts, which cannot respond to this priming, also expressed reduced levels of STAT1, which correlated with their poor responses to IFN\u03b3. The lack of priming in IFNAR1\u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts was compensated by over-expression of STAT1, which rescued molecular responses to IFN\u03b3 and restored the ability of IFN\u03b3 to induce protective anti-viral immunity. This study provides a comprehensive description of the molecular events involved in priming by type I IFN. Adding to the previous working model that proposed an interaction between type I and II IFN receptors, our work and that of others demonstrates that type I IFN primes IFN\u03b3-mediated immune responses by regulating expression of STAT1. This may also explain how type I IFN can additionally prime cells to respond to a range of other cytokines that use STAT1 (e.g., IL-6, M-CSF, IL-', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Functional_Crosstalk_between_Type_I_and_II_Interferon_through_the_Regulated_Expression_of_STAT1/143714', [u'Biochemistry', u'Immunology', u'Cell Biology', u'Cancer'], []]

Additionally, the methods used to measure recombination make a variety of assumptions about the underlying process, and often fail to account adequately for issues such as co-infection of cells or the possibility of multiple template switches between recombination sites. We have developed a HIV-1 marker system by making a small number of codon modifications in gag which allow recombination to be measured over various lengths between closely related viral genomes. We have developed statistical tools to measure recombination rates that can compensate for the possibility of multiple template switches. Our results show that when multiple template switches are ignored the error is substantial, particularly when recombination rates are high, or the genomic distance is large.

Here we found that the type III effectors, NleE from enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and OspZ from Shigella, blocked translocation of the p65 subunit of the transcription factor, NF-\u03baB, to the host cell nucleus. NF-\u03baB inhibition by NleE was associated with decreased IL-8 expression in EPEC-infected intestinal epithelial cells. Ectopically expressed NleE also blocked nuclear translocation of p65 and c-Rel, but not p50 or STAT1/2. NleE homologues from other attaching and effacing pathogens as well OspZ from Shigella flexneri 6 and Shigella boydii, also inhibited NF-\u03baB activation and p65 nuclear import; however, a truncated form of OspZ from S. flexneri 2a that carries a 36 amino acid deletion at the C-terminus had no inhibitory activity. We determined that the C-termini of NleE and full length OspZ were functionally interchangeable and identified a six amino acid motif, IDSY(M/I)K, that was important for both NleE- and OspZ-mediated inhibition of NF-\u03baB activity. We also established that NleB, encoded directly upstream from NleE, suppressed NF-\u03baB activation. Whereas NleE inhibited both TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 stimulated p65 nuclear translocation and I\u03baB degradation, NleB inhibited the TNF\u03b1 pathway only. Neither NleE nor NleB inhibited AP-1 activation, suggesting that the modulatory activity of the effectors was specific for NF-\u03baB signaling. Overall our data show that EPEC and Shigella have evolved similar T3SS-dependent means to manipulate host inflammatory pathways by interfering with the activation of selected host transcriptional regulators.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/The_Type_III_Effectors_NleE_and_NleB_from_Enteropathogenic_em_E_coli_em_and_OspZ_from_em_Shigella_em_Block_Nuclear_Translocation_of_NF_B_p65/143478', [u'Microbiology', u'Cell Biology', u'Engineering', u'Immunology'], []]

Lo', 'Trevor Lithgow', 'Jorg Heierhorst'], u'2010-05-14T00:57:34Z', u'PUFs are RNA binding proteins that promote mRNA deadenylation and decay and inhibit translation. Yeast Puf5 is the prototype for studying PUF-dependent gene repression. Puf5 binds to the Pop2 subunit of the Ccr4-Pop2-NOT mRNA deadenylase, recruiting the deadenylase and associated translational repressors to mRNAs. Here we used yeast genetics to show that Puf5 has additional roles in vivo that do not require Pop2. Deletion of PUF5 caused increased sensitivity to DNA replication stress in cells lacking Pop2, as well as in cells mutated for two activities recruited to mRNAs by the Puf5-Pop2 interaction, the deadenylase Ccr4 and the translational repressor Dhh1. A functional Puf5 RNA binding domain was required, and Puf5 cytoplasmic localisation was sufficient for resistance to replication stress, indicating posttranscriptional gene expression control is involved. In contrast to DNA replication stress, in response to the cell wall integrity pathway activator caffeine, PUF5 and POP2 acted in the same genetic pathway, indicating that functions of Puf5 in the caffeine response are mediated by Pop2-dependent gene repression. Our results support a model in which Puf5 uses multiple, Pop2-dependent and Pop2-independent mechanisms to control mRNA expression. The Pop2-independent roles for Puf5 could involve spatial control of gene expression, a proposition supported by our data indicating that the active form of Puf5 is localised to cytoplasmic foci.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/The_Yeast_PUF_Protein_Puf5_Has_Pop2_Independent_Roles_in_Response_to_DNA_Replication_Stress/143454', [u'Molecular Biology', u'Cell Biology'], []]

PDVs associated with braconid and ichneumonid wasps, bracoviruses and ichnoviruses respectively, both deliver multiple circular dsDNA molecules to the caterpillar. These molecules contain virulence genes but lack core genes typically involved in particle production. This is not completely unexpected given that no PDV replication takes place in the caterpillar. Particle production is confined to the wasp ovary where viral DNAs are generated from proviral copies maintained within the wasp genome. We recently showed that the genes involved in bracovirus particle production reside within the wasp genome and are related to nudiviruses. In the present work we characterized genes involved in ichnovirus particle production by analyzing the components of purified Hyposoter didymator Ichnovirus particles by LC-MS/MS and studying their organization in the wasp genome. Their products are conserved among ichnovirus-associated wasps and constitute a specific set of proteins in the virosphere. Strikingly, these genes are clustered in specialized regions of the wasp genome which are amplified along with proviral DNA during virus particle replication, but are not packaged in the particles. Clearly our results show that ichnoviruses and bracoviruses particles originated from different viral entities, thus providing an example of convergent evolution where two groups of wasps have independently domesticated viruses to deliver genes into their hosts.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Analysis_of_Virion_Structural_Components_Reveals_Vestiges_of_the_Ancestral_Ichnovirus_Genome/143287', [u'Cancer'], []]

Several such models have been proposed that successfully reproduce firing properties of neurons recorded from monkeys performing working memory tasks. However, the regular temporal structure of spike trains in these models is often incompatible with experimental data. Here, we show that the in vivo observations of bistable activity with irregular firing at the single cell level can be achieved in a large-scale network model with a modular structure in terms of several connected hypercolumns. Despite high irregularity of individual spike trains, the model shows population oscillations in the beta and gamma band in ground and active states, respectively. Irregular firing typically emerges in a high-conductance regime of balanced excitation and inhibition. Population oscillations can produce such a regime, but in previous models only a non-coding ground state was oscillatory. Due to the modular structure of our network, the oscillatory and irregular firing was maintained also in the active state without fine-tuning. Our model provides a novel mechanistic view of how irregular firing emerges in cortical populations as they go from beta to gamma oscillations during memory retrieval.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Bistable_Irregular_Firing_and_Population_Oscillations_in_a_Modular_Attractor_Memory_Network/143175', [u'Medicine', u'Neuroscience'], []]

Crabb'], u'2010-06-03T00:53:24Z', u'Apicomplexan parasites are obligate intracellular parasites that infect a variety of hosts, causing significant diseases in livestock and humans. The invasive forms of the parasites invade their host cells by gliding motility, an active process driven by parasite adhesion proteins and molecular motors. A crucial point during host cell invasion is the formation of a ring-shaped area of intimate contact between the parasite and the host known as a tight junction. As the invasive zoite propels itself into the host-cell, the junction moves down the length of the parasite. This process must be tightly regulated and signalling is likely to play a role in this event. One crucial protein for tight-junction formation is the apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1). Here we have investigated the phosphorylation status of this key player in the invasion process in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. We show that the cytoplasmic tail of P. falciparum AMA1 is phosphorylated at serine 610. We provide evidence that the enzyme responsible for serine 610 phosphorylation is the cAMP regulated protein kinase A (PfPKA). Importantly, mutation of AMA1 serine 610 to alanine abrogates phosphorylation of AMA1 in vivo and dramatically impedes invasion. In addition to shedding unexpected new light on AMA1 function, this work represents the first time PKA has been implicated in merozoite invasion.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Protein_Kinase_A_Dependent_Phosphorylation_of_Apical_Membrane_Antigen_1_Plays_an_Important_Role_in_Erythrocyte_Invasion_by_the_Malaria_Parasite/143204', [u'Biochemistry', u'Physics', u'Microbiology'], []]

Failure of antibiotic therapy to eradicate infection is frequently described; in some cases associated with altered S. aureus antimicrobial resistance or the small colony variant (SCV) phenotype. Newer antimicrobials, such as linezolid, remain the last available therapy for some patients with multi-resistant S. aureus infections. Using comparative and functional genomics we investigated the molecular determinants of resistance and SCV formation in sequential S. aureus isolates from a patient who had a persistent and recurrent S. aureus infection, after failed therapy with multiple antimicrobials, including linezolid. Two point mutations in key staphylococcal genes dramatically affected clinical behaviour of the bacterium, altering virulence and antimicrobial resistance. Most strikingly, a single nucleotide substitution in relA (SACOL1689) reduced RelA hydrolase activity and caused accumulation of the intracellular signalling molecule guanosine 3\u2032, 5\u2032-bis(diphosphate) (ppGpp) and permanent activation of the stringent response, which has not previously been reported in S. aureus. Using the clinical isolate and a defined mutant with an identical relA mutation, we demonstrate for the first time the impact of an active stringent response in S. aureus, which was associated with reduced growth, and attenuated virulence in the Galleria mellonella model. In addition, a mutation in rlmN (SACOL1230), encoding a ribosomal methyltransferase that methylates 23S rRNA at position A2503, caused a reduction in linezolid susceptibility. These results reinforce the exquisite adaptability of S. aureus and show how subtle molecular changes cause major alterations in bacterial behaviour, as well as highlighting potential weaknesses of current antibiotic treatment regimens.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Two_Novel_Point_Mutations_in_Clinical_em_Staphylococcus_aureus_em_Reduce_Linezolid_Susceptibility_and_Switch_on_the_Stringent_Response_to_Promote_Persistent_Infection/143105', [u'Genetics', u'Cancer', u'Microbiology'], []]

Williams', 'M. Suresh'], u'2010-06-24T00:48:34Z', u'Type I interferons (IFNs) are known to mediate viral control, and also promote survival and expansion of virus-specific CD8+ T cells. However, it is unclear whether signaling cascades involved in eliciting these diverse cellular effects are also distinct. One of the best-characterized anti-viral signaling mechanisms of Type I IFNs is mediated by the IFN-inducible dsRNA activated protein kinase, PKR. Here, we have investigated the role of PKR and Type I IFNs in regulating viral clearance and CD8+ T cell response during primary and secondary viral infections. Our studies demonstrate differential requirement for PKR, in viral control versus elicitation of CD8+ T cell responses during primary infection of mice with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). PKR-deficient mice mounted potent CD8+ T cell responses, but failed to effectively control LCMV. The compromised LCMV control in the absence of PKR was multifactorial, and linked to less effective CD8+ T cell-mediated viral suppression, enhanced viral replication in cells, and lower steady state expression levels of IFN-responsive genes. Moreover, we show that despite normal expansion of memory CD8+ T cells and differentiation into effectors during a secondary response, effective clearance of LCMV but not vaccinia virus required PKR activity in infected cells. In the absence of Type I IFN signaling, secondary effector CD8+ T cells were ineffective in controlling both LCMV and vaccinia virus replication in vivo. These findings provide insight into cellular pathways of Type I IFN actions, and highlight the under-appreciated importance of innate immune mechanisms of viral control during secondary infections, despite the accelerated responses of memory CD8+ T cells. Additionally, the results presented here have furthered our understanding of the immune correlates of anti-viral protective immunity, which have implications in the rational design of vaccines.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Role_of_PKR_and_Type_I_IFNs_in_Viral_Control_during_Primary_and_Secondary_Infection/142914', [u'Immunology'], []]

Nassel'], u'2010-07-08T00:45:31Z', u'In Drosophila, neurosecretory cells that release peptide hormones play a prominent role in the regulation of development, growth, metabolism, and reproduction. Several types of peptidergic neurosecretory cells have been identified in the brain of Drosophila with release sites in the corpora cardiaca and anterior aorta. We show here that in adult flies the products of three neuropeptide precursors are colocalized in five pairs of large protocerebral neurosecretory cells in two clusters (designated ipc-1 and ipc-2a): Drosophila tachykinin (DTK), short neuropeptide F (sNPF) and ion transport peptide (ITP). These peptides were detected by immunocytochemistry in combination with GFP expression driven by the enhancer trap Gal4 lines c929 and Kurs-6, both of which are expressed in ipc-1 and 2a cells. This mix of colocalized peptides with seemingly unrelated functions is intriguing and prompted us to initiate analysis of the function of the ten neurosecretory cells. We investigated the role of peptide signaling from large ipc-1 and 2a cells in stress responses by monitoring the effect of starvation and desiccation in flies with levels of DTK or sNPF diminished by RNA interference. Using the Gal4-UAS system we targeted the peptide knockdown specifically to ipc-1 and 2a cells with the c929 and Kurs-6 drivers. Flies with reduced DTK or sNPF levels in these cells displayed decreased survival time at desiccation and starvation, as well as increased water loss at desiccation. Our data suggest that homeostasis during metabolic stress requires intact peptide signaling by ipc-1 and 2a neurosecretory cells.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Metabolic_Stress_Responses_in_em_Drosophila_em_Are_Modulated_by_Brain_Neurosecretory_Cells_That_Produce_Multiple_Neuropeptides/142731', [u'Neuroscience'], []]

While proximity to stagnant or slow flowing water bodies is a risk factor for acquiring BU, the epidemiology and mode of M. ulcerans transmission is poorly understood. Here we have used high-throughput DNA sequencing and comparisons of the genomes of seven M. ulcerans isolates that appeared monomorphic by existing typing methods. We identified a limited number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and developed a real-time PCR SNP typing method based on these differences. We then investigated clinical isolates of M. ulcerans on which we had detailed information concerning patient location and time of diagnosis. Within the Densu river basin of Ghana we observed dominance of one clonal complex and local clustering of some of the variants belonging to this complex. These results reveal focal transmission and demonstrate, that micro-epidemiological analyses by SNP typing has great potential to help us understand how M. ulcerans is transmitted.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Single_Nucleotide_Polymorphism_Typing_of_em_Mycobacterium_ulcerans_em_Reveals_Focal_Transmission_of_Buruli_Ulcer_in_a_Highly_Endemic_Region_of_Ghana/142601', [u'Medicine'], []]

[u'Protective Efficacy of Cross-Reactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T Cells Recognising Mutant Viral Epitopes Depends on Peptide-MHC-I Structural Interactions and T Cell Activation Threshold', ['Sophie A. Valkenburg', 'Stephanie Gras', 'Carole Guillonneau', 'Nicole L. La Gruta', 'Paul G. Thomas', 'Anthony W. Purcell', 'Jamie Rossjohn', 'Peter C. Doherty', 'Stephen J. Turner', 'Katherine Kedzierska'], u'2010-08-12T00:36:50Z', u'Emergence of a new influenza strain leads to a rapid global spread of the virus due to minimal antibody immunity. Pre-existing CD8+ T-cell immunity directed towards conserved internal viral regions can greatly ameliorate the disease. However, mutational escape within the T cell epitopes is a substantial issue for virus control and vaccine design. Although mutations can result in a loss of T cell recognition, some variants generate cross-reactive T cell responses. In this study, we used reverse genetics to modify the influenza NP336\u2013374 peptide at a partially-solvent exposed residue (N->A, NPN3A mutation) to assess the availability, effectiveness and mechanism underlying influenza-specific cross-reactive T cell responses. The engineered virus induced a diminished CD8+ T cell response and selected a narrowed T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire within two V\u03b2 regions (V\u03b28.3 and V\u03b29). This can be partially explained by the H-2DbNPN3A structure that showed a loss of several contacts between the NPN3A peptide and H-2Db, including a contact with His155, a position known to play an important role in mediating TCR-pMHC-I interactions. Despite these differences, common cross-reactive TCRs were detected in both the na\xefve and immune NPN3A-specific TCR repertoires. However, while the NPN3A epitope primes memory T-cells that give an equivalent recall response to the mutant or wild-type (wt) virus, both are markedly lower than wt->wt challenge. Such decreased CD8+ responses elicited after heterologous challenge resulted in delayed viral clearance from the infected lung. Furthermore, mice first exposed to the wt virus give a poor, low avidity response following secondary infection with the mutant. Thus, the protective efficacy of cross-reactive CD8+ T cells recognising mutant viral epitopes depend on peptide-MHC-I structural interactions and functional avidity. Our study does not support vaccine strategies that include immunization against commonly selected cross-reactive variants with mutations at partially-solvent exposed residues that have characteristics comparable to NPN3A.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Protective_Efficacy_of_Cross_Reactive_CD8_sup_sup_T_Cells_Recognising_Mutant_Viral_Epitopes_Depends_on_Peptide_MHC_I_Structural_Interactions_and_T_Cell_Activation_Threshold/142210', [u'Immunology'], []]

The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between viral fitness and control of viral load (VL) in acute and early HIV-1 infection. Samples were obtained from subjects participating in two clinical studies. In the PULSE study, antiretroviral therapy (ART) was initiated before, or no later than six months following seroconversion. Subjects then underwent multiple structured treatment interruptions (STIs). The PHAEDRA study enrolled and monitored a cohort of individuals with documented evidence of primary infection. The subset chosen were individuals identified no later than 12 months following seroconversion to HIV-1, who were not receiving ART. The relative fitness of primary isolates obtained from study participants was investigated ex vivo. Viral DNA production was quantified using a novel real time PCR assay. Following intermittent ART, the fitness of isolates obtained from 5 of 6 PULSE subjects decreased over time. In contrast, in the absence of ART the fitness of paired isolates obtained from 7 of 9 PHAEDRA subjects increased over time. However, viral fitness did not correlate with plasma VL. Most unexpected was the high relative fitness of isolates obtained at Baseline from PULSE subjects, before initiating ART. It is widely thought that the fitness of strains present during the acute phase is low relative to strains present during chronic HIV-1 infection, due to the bottleneck imposed upon transmission. The results of this study provide evidence that the relative fitness of strains present during acute HIV-1 infection may be higher than previously thought. Furthermore, that viral fitness may represent an important clinical parameter to be considered when deciding whether to initiate ART during early HIV-1 infection.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/High_Viral_Fitness_during_Acute_HIV_1_Infection/141730', [u'Cancer', u'Medicine', u'Cell Biology'], []]

Only one moderately effective therapy exists, albeit with contraindications that exclude 90% of the patients. This medical need contrasts with a high failure rate of more than 1,000 pre-clinical drug candidates for stroke therapies. Thus, there is a need for translatable mechanisms of neuroprotection and more rigid thresholds of relevance in pre-clinical stroke models. One such candidate mechanism is oxidative stress. However, antioxidant approaches have failed in clinical trials, and the significant sources of oxidative stress in stroke are unknown. We here identify NADPH oxidase type 4 (NOX4) as a major source of oxidative stress and an effective therapeutic target in acute stroke. Upon ischemia, NOX4 was induced in human and mouse brain. Mice deficient in NOX4 (Nox4\u2212/\u2212) of either sex, but not those deficient for NOX1 or NOX2, were largely protected from oxidative stress, blood-brain-barrier leakage, and neuronal apoptosis, after both transient and permanent cerebral ischemia. This effect was independent of age, as elderly mice were equally protected. Restoration of oxidative stress reversed the stroke-protective phenotype in Nox4\u2212/\u2212 mice. Application of the only validated low-molecular-weight pharmacological NADPH oxidase inhibitor, VAS2870, several hours after ischemia was as protective as deleting NOX4. The extent of neuroprotection was exceptional, resulting in significantly improved long-term neurological functions and reduced mortality.

[u'The SR-BI Partner PDZK1 Facilitates Hepatitis C Virus Entry', ['Nicholas S. Eyre', 'Heidi E. Drummer', 'Michael R. Beard'], u'2010-10-07T00:21:15Z', u'Entry of hepatitis C virus (HCV) into hepatocytes is a multi-step process that involves a number of different host cell factors. Following initial engagement with glycosaminoglycans and the low-density lipoprotein receptor, it is thought that HCV entry proceeds via interactions with the tetraspanin CD81, scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), and the tight-junction proteins claudin-1 (CLDN1) and occludin (OCLN), culminating in clathrin-dependent endocytosis of HCV particles and their pH-dependent fusion with endosomal membranes. Physiologically, SR-BI is the major receptor for high-density lipoproteins (HDL) in the liver, where its expression is primarily controlled at the post-transcriptional level by its interaction with the scaffold protein PDZK1. However, the importance of interaction with PDZK1 to the involvement of SR-BI in HCV entry is unclear. Here we demonstrate that stable shRNA-knockdown of PDZK1 expression in human hepatoma cells significantly reduces their susceptibility to HCV infection, and that this effect can be reversed by overexpression of full length PDZK1 but not the first PDZ domain of PDZK1 alone. Furthermore, we found that overexpression of a green fluorescent protein chimera of the cytoplasmic carboxy-terminus of SR-BI (amino acids 479\u2013509) in Huh-7 cells resulted in its interaction with PDZK1 and a reduced susceptibility to HCV infection. In contrast a similar chimera lacking the final amino acid of SR-BI (amino acids 479\u2013508) failed to interact with PDZK1 and did not inhibit HCV infection. Taken together these results indicate an indirect involvement of PDZK1 in HCV entry via its ability to interact with SR-BI and enhance its activity as an HCV entry factor.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/The_SR_BI_Partner_PDZK1_Facilitates_Hepatitis_C_Virus_Entry/141275', [u'Cancer'], []]

The associated SNPs included proxies for HLA-DRB1*15:01 and HLA-DRB1*03:01, and SNPs in moderate linkage disequilibrium (LD) with HLA-A*02:01, HLA-DRB1*04:01 and HLA-DRB1*13:03. We also found a strong association with rs9277535 in the class II gene HLA-DPB1 (discovery set , replication set , combined ). HLA-DPB1 is located centromeric of the more commonly typed class II genes HLA-DRB1, -DQA1 and -DQB1. It is separated from these genes by a recombination hotspot, and the association is not affected by conditioning on genotypes at DRB1, DQA1 and DQB1. Hence rs9277535 represents an independent MS-susceptibility locus of genome-wide significance. It is correlated with the HLA-DPB1*03:01 allele, which has been implicated previously in MS in smaller studies. Further genotyping in large datasets is required to confirm and resolve this association.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/A_Polymorphism_in_the_em_HLA_DPB1_em_Gene_Is_Associated_with_Susceptibility_to_Multiple_Sclerosis/140951', [u'Neuroscience', u'Genetics'], []]

Recently, theoretical models have suggested that current condition may be a better index of mate value than past immunocompetence. This is particularly likely in populations where pathogenic fluctuation is fast relative to host life history. As life history is slow in humans, there is reason to expect that, among humans, condition-dependent traits might contribute more to attractiveness than relatively stable traits such as masculinity.

By comparative genomics, we identified 45 potential M. ulcerans specific proteins, of which we were able to express and purify 33 in E. coli. Sera from 30 confirmed Buruli ulcer patients, 24 healthy controls from the same endemic region and 30 healthy controls from a non-endemic region in Benin were screened for antibody responses to these specific proteins by ELISA. Serum IgG responses of Buruli ulcer patients were highly variable, however, seven proteins (MUP045, MUP057, MUL_0513, Hsp65, and the polyketide synthase domains ER, AT propionate, and KR A) showed a significant difference between patient and non-endemic control antibody responses. However, when sera from the healthy control subjects living in the same Buruli ulcer endemic area as the patients were examined, none of the proteins were able to discriminate between these two groups. Nevertheless, six of the seven proteins showed an ability to distinguish people living in an endemic area from those in a non-endemic area with an average sensitivity of 69% and specificity of 88%, suggesting exposure to M. ulcerans. Further validation of these six proteins is now underway to assess their suitability for use in Buruli ulcer seroepidemiological studies.

Dichelobacter nodosus is the causative agent of ovine footrot, a highly contagious disease that is characterized by the separation of the hoof from the underlying tissue. D. nodosus secretes three subtilisin-like proteases whose analysis forms the basis of diagnostic tests that differentiate between virulent and benign strains and have been postulated to play a role in virulence. We have constructed protease mutants of D. nodosus; their analysis in a sheep virulence model revealed that one of these enzymes, AprV2, was required for virulence. These studies challenge the previous hypothesis that the elastase activity of AprV2 is important for disease progression, since aprV2 mutants were virulent when complemented with aprB2, which encodes a variant that has impaired elastase activity. We have determined the crystal structures of both AprV2 and AprB2 and characterized the biological activity of these enzymes. These data reveal that an unusual extended disulphide-tethered loop functions as an exosite, mediating effective enzyme-substrate interactions. The disulphide bond and Tyr92, which was located at the exposed end of the loop, were functionally important. Bioinformatic analyses suggested that other pathogenic bacteria may have proteases that utilize a similar mechanism. In conclusion, we have used an integrated multidisciplinary combination of bacterial genetics, whole animal virulence trials in the original host, biochemical studies, and comprehensive analysis of crystal structures to provide the first definitive evidence that the extracellular secreted proteases produced by D. nodosus are required for virulence and to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which these proteases bind to their natural substrates. We postulate that this exosite mechanism may be used by proteases produced by other bacterial pathogens of both humans and animals.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/The_Subtilisin_Like_Protease_AprV2_Is_Required_for_Virulence_and_Uses_a_Novel_Disulphide_Tethered_Exosite_to_Bind_Substrates/140466', [u'Biochemistry', u'Cancer', u'Microbiology'], []]

A genome-wide screen for copper homeostasis genes in Drosophila melanogaster identified the SNARE gene Syntaxin 5 (Syx5) as playing an important role in copper regulation; flies heterozygous for a null mutation in Syx5 display increased tolerance to high dietary copper. The phenotype is shown here to be due to a decrease in copper accumulation, a mechanism also observed in both Drosophila and human cell lines. Studies in adult Drosophila tissue suggest that very low levels of Syx5 result in neuronal defects and lethality, and increased levels also generate neuronal defects. In contrast, mild suppression generates a phenotype typical of copper-deficiency in viable, fertile flies and is exacerbated by co-suppression of the copper uptake gene Ctr1A. Reduced copper uptake appears to be due to reduced levels at the plasma membrane of the copper uptake transporter, Ctr1. Thus Syx5 plays an essential role in copper homeostasis and is a candidate gene for copper-related disease in humans.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Syntaxin_5_Is_Required_for_Copper_Homeostasis_in_em_Drosophila_em_and_Mammals/139990', [u'Genetics', u'Cell Biology'], []]

A set of insulin producing cells (IPCs) in the Drosophila brain that express three ILPs (DILP2, 3 and 5) have been the main focus of interest in hormonal DILP signaling. Little is, however, known about factors that regulate DILP production and release by these IPCs. Here we show that the IPCs express the metabotropic GABAB receptor (GBR), but not the ionotropic GABAA receptor subunit RDL. Diminishing the GBR expression on these cells by targeted RNA interference abbreviates life span, decreases metabolic stress resistance and alters carbohydrate and lipid metabolism at stress, but not growth in Drosophila. A direct effect of diminishing GBR on IPCs is an increase in DILP immunofluorescence in these cells, an effect that is accentuated at starvation. Knockdown of irk3, possibly part of a G protein-activated inwardly rectifying K+ channel that may link to GBRs, phenocopies GBR knockdown in starvation experiments. Our experiments suggest that the GBR is involved in inhibitory control of DILP production and release in adult flies at metabolic stress and that this receptor mediates a GABA signal from brain interneurons that may convey nutritional signals.

[u'The Relationship between Diet Breadth and Geographic Range Size in the Butterfly Subfamily Nymphalinae \u2013 A Study of Global Scale', ['Jessica Slove', 'Niklas Janz'], u'2011-01-05T02:41:41Z', u'The \u201coscillation hypothesis\u201d has been proposed as a general explanation for the exceptional diversification of herbivorous insect species. The hypothesis states that speciation rates are elevated through repeated correlated changes \u2013 oscillations \u2013 in degree of host plant specificity and geographic range. The aim of this study is to test one of the predictions from the oscillation hypothesis: a positive correlation between diet breadth (number of host plants used) and geographic range size, using the globally distributed butterfly subfamily Nymphalinae. Data on diet breadth and global geographic range were collected for 182 Nymphalinae butterflies species and the size of the geographic range was measured using a GIS. We tested both diet breadth and geographic range size for phylogenetic signal to see if species are independent of each other with respect to these characters. As this test gave inconclusive results, data was analysed both using cross-species comparisons and taking phylogeny into account using generalised estimating equations as applied in the APE package in R. Irrespective of which method was used, we found a significant positive correlation between diet breadth and geographic range size. These results are consistent for two different measures of diet breadth and removal of outliers. We conclude that the global range sizes of Nymphalinae butterflies are correlated to diet breadth. That is, butterflies that feed on a large number of host plants tend to have larger geographic ranges than do butterflies that feed on fewer plants. These results lend support for an important step in the oscillation hypothesis of plant-driven diversification, in that it can provide the necessary fuel for future population fragmentation and speciation.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/The_Relationship_between_Diet_Breadth_and_Geographic_Range_Size_in_the_Butterfly_Subfamily_Nymphalinae_A_Study_of_Global_Scale/139701', [u'Evolutionary Biology', u'Ecology'], []]

[u'<em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em> Infection Induces Altered Amphiregulin Processing and Release', ['Sonja Lofmark', 'Nele de Klerk', 'Helena Aro'], u'2011-01-27T02:34:18Z', u'Adhesion of the human pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae has established effects on the host cell and evokes a variety of cellular events including growth factor activation. In the present study we report that infection with N. gonorrhoeae causes altered amphiregulin processing and release in human epithelial cells. Amphiregulin is a well-studied growth factor with functions in various cell processes and is upregulated in different forms cancer and proliferative diseases. The protein is prototypically cleaved on the cell surface in response to external stimuli. We demonstrate that upon infection, a massive upregulation of amphiregulin mRNA is seen. The protein changes its subcellular distribution and is also alternatively cleaved at the plasma membrane, which results in augmented release of an infection-specific 36 kDa amphiregulin product from the surface of human cervical epithelial cells. Further, using antibodies directed against different domains of the protein we could determine the impact of infection on pro-peptide processing. In summary, we present data showing that the infection of N. gonorrhoeae causes an alternative amphiregulin processing, subcellular distribution and release in human epithelial cervical cells that likely contribute to the predisposition cellular abnormalities and anti-apoptotic features of N. gonorrhoeae infections.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/_em_Neisseria_gonorrhoeae_em_Infection_Induces_Altered_Amphiregulin_Processing_and_Release/139258', [u'Microbiology', u'Cell Biology', u'Cancer'], []]

Despite its socioeconomic impact, almost nothing is known about the molecular biology of this parasite, its interplay with its hosts, and the pathogenesis of fascioliasis. Modern genomic technologies now provide unique opportunities to rapidly tackle these exciting areas. The present study reports the first transcriptome representing the adult stage of F. gigantica (of bovid origin), defined using a massively parallel sequencing-coupled bioinformatic approach. From >20 million raw sequence reads, >30,000 contiguous sequences were assembled, of which most were novel. Relative levels of transcription were determined for individual molecules, which were also characterized (at the inferred amino acid level) based on homology, gene ontology, and/or pathway mapping. Comparisons of the transcriptome of F. gigantica with those of other trematodes, including F. hepatica, revealed similarities in transcription for molecules inferred to have key roles in parasite-host interactions. Overall, the present dataset should provide a solid foundation for future fundamental genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic explorations of F. gigantica, as well as a basis for applied outcomes such as the development of novel methods of intervention against this neglected parasite.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/A_Portrait_of_the_Transcriptome_of_the_Neglected_Trematode_em_Fasciola_gigantica_em_Biological_and_Biotechnological_Implications/139122', [u'Genetics', u'Cancer'], []]

A well-sampled population will show a curve that levels off and approaches an asymptote, that would approximate the total number of types in the population. The curves from the three African populations (Bakoumba, Pikine, Kilifi) did not show evidence of leveling off, in contrast to the curves from Amele, Papua New Guinea [17] or Porto Velho, Brazil [19]. Sampling of the African populations has not yet begun to approach the limits of diversity. B) Sharing of var types among the three African population samples. Between 26 and 41 var types were shared among any two population samples; only 10 var types were found in all three populations.

[u'Resolving the Trophic Relations of Cryptic Species: An Example Using Stable Isotope Analysis of Dolphin Teeth', ['Kylie Owen', 'Kate Charlton-Robb', 'Ross Thompson'], u'2011-02-18T02:25:29Z', u'Understanding the foraging ecology and diet of animals can play a crucial role in conservation of a species. This is particularly true where species are cryptic and coexist in environments where observing feeding behaviour directly is difficult. Here we present the first information on the foraging ecology of a recently identified species of dolphin (Southern Australian bottlenose dolphin (SABD)) and comparisons to the common bottlenose dolphin (CBD) in Victoria, Australia, using stable isotope analysis of teeth. Stable isotope signatures differed significantly between SABD and CBD for both \u03b413C (\u221214.4\u2030 vs. \u221215.5\u2030 respectively) and \u03b415N (15.9\u2030 vs. 15.0\u2030 respectively), suggesting that the two species forage in different areas and consume different prey. This finding supports genetic and morphological data indicating that SABD are distinct from CBD. In Victoria, the SABD is divided into two distinct populations, one in the large drowned river system of Port Phillip Bay and the other in a series of coastal lakes and lagoons called the Gippsland Lakes. Within the SABD species, population differences were apparent. The Port Phillip Bay population displayed a significantly higher \u03b415N than the Gippsland Lakes population (17.0\u2030 vs. 15.5\u2030), suggesting that the Port Phillip Bay population may feed at a higher trophic level - a result which is supported by analysis of local food chains. Important future work is required to further understand the foraging ecology and diet of this newly described, endemic, and potentially endangered species of dolphin.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Resolving_the_Trophic_Relations_of_Cryptic_Species_An_Example_Using_Stable_Isotope_Analysis_of_Dolphin_Teeth/138729', [u'Ecology', u'Inorganic Chemistry'], []]

However, whether these associations can be consistently replicated, vary with disease aggressiveness (tumor stage and grade) and/or interact with non-genetic potential risk factors or other SNPs is unknown. We therefore genotyped 39 SNPs from regions identified by several prostate cancer GWAS in 10,501 prostate cancer cases and 10,831 controls from the NCI Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium (BPC3). We replicated 36 out of 39 SNPs (P-values ranging from 0.01 to 10\u221228). Two SNPs located near KLK3 associated with PSA levels showed differential association with Gleason grade (rs2735839, P\u200a=\u200a0.0001 and rs266849, P\u200a=\u200a0.0004; case-only test), where the alleles associated with decreasing PSA levels were inversely associated with low-grade (as defined by Gleason grade <8) tumors but positively associated with high-grade tumors. No other SNP showed differential associations according to disease stage or grade. We observed no effect modification by SNP for association with age at diagnosis, family history of prostate cancer, diabetes, BMI, height, smoking or alcohol intake. Moreover, we found no evidence of pair-wise SNP-SNP interactions. While these SNPs represent new independent risk factors for prostate cancer, we saw little evidence for effect modification by other SNPs or by the environmental factors examined.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Characterizing_Associations_and_SNP_Environment_Interactions_for_GWAS_Identified_Prostate_Cancer_Risk_Markers_Results_from_BPC3/138632', [u'Genetics', u'Biological Sciences', u'Cancer', u'Biotechnology', u'Cell Biology'], []]

We performed a quantitative proteomic assessment of Giardia mitosomes to increase understanding of the function and evolutionary origin of these enigmatic organelles. Mitosome-enriched fractions were obtained from cell homogenate using Optiprep gradient centrifugation. To distinguish mitosomal proteins from contamination, we used a quantitative shot-gun strategy based on isobaric tagging of peptides with iTRAQ and tandem mass spectrometry. Altogether, 638 proteins were identified in mitosome-enriched fractions. Of these, 139 proteins had iTRAQ ratio similar to that of the six known mitosomal markers. Proteins were selected for expression in Giardia to verify their cellular localizations and the mitosomal localization of 20 proteins was confirmed. These proteins include nine components of the FeS cluster assembly machinery, a novel diflavo-protein with NADPH reductase activity, a novel VAMP-associated protein, and a key component of the outer membrane protein translocase. None of the novel mitosomal proteins was predicted by previous genome analyses. The small proteome of the Giardia mitosome reflects the reduction in mitochondrial metabolism, which is limited to the FeS cluster assembly pathway, and a simplicity in the protein import pathway required for organelle biogenesis.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/The_Minimal_Proteome_in_the_Reduced_Mitochondrion_of_the_Parasitic_Protist_em_Giardia_intestinalis_em_/138640', [u'Evolutionary Biology', u'Microbiology', u'Cell Biology'], []]

DSD are often due to disruption of the genetic programs that regulate gonad development. Although some genes have been identified in these developmental pathways, the causative mutations have not been identified in more than 50% 46,XY DSD cases. We used the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 to analyse copy number variation in 23 individuals with unexplained 46,XY DSD due to gonadal dysgenesis (GD). Here we describe three discrete changes in copy number that are the likely cause of the GD. Firstly, we identified a large duplication on the X chromosome that included DAX1 (NR0B1). Secondly, we identified a rearrangement that appears to affect a novel gonad-specific regulatory region in a known testis gene, SOX9. Surprisingly this patient lacked any signs of campomelic dysplasia, suggesting that the deletion affected expression of SOX9 only in the gonad. Functional analysis of potential SRY binding sites within this deleted region identified five putative enhancers, suggesting that sequences additional to the known SRY-binding TES enhancer influence human testis-specific SOX9 expression. Thirdly, we identified a small deletion immediately downstream of GATA4, supporting a role for GATA4 in gonad development in humans. These CNV analyses give new insights into the pathways involved in human gonad development and dysfunction, and suggest that rearrangements of non-coding sequences disturbing gene regulation may account for significant proportion of DSD cases.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Copy_Number_Variation_in_Patients_with_Disorders_of_Sex_Development_Due_to_46_XY_Gonadal_Dysgenesis/138396', [u'Developmental Biology', u'Genetics', u'Physiology', u'Chemistry'], []]

Rocha', 'Fredrik Liljeros', 'Petter Holme'], u'2011-03-17T02:15:30Z', u'Sexual contact patterns, both in their temporal and network structure, can influence the spread of sexually transmitted infections (STI). Most previous literature has focused on effects of network topology; few studies have addressed the role of temporal structure. We simulate disease spread using SI and SIR models on an empirical temporal network of sexual contacts in high-end prostitution. We compare these results with several other approaches, including randomization of the data, classic mean-field approaches, and static network simulations. We observe that epidemic dynamics in this contact structure have well-defined, rather high epidemic thresholds. Temporal effects create a broad distribution of outbreak sizes, even if the per-contact transmission probability is taken to its hypothetical maximum of 100%. In general, we conclude that the temporal correlations of our network accelerate outbreaks, especially in the early phase of the epidemics, while the network topology (apart from the contact-rate distribution) slows them down. We find that the temporal correlations of sexual contacts can significantly change simulated outbreaks in a large empirical sexual network. Thus, temporal structures are needed alongside network topology to fully understand the spread of STIs. On a side note, our simulations further suggest that the specific type of commercial sex we investigate is not a reservoir of major importance for HIV.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Simulated_Epidemics_in_an_Empirical_Spatiotemporal_Network_of_50_185_Sexual_Contacts/138130', [u'Medicine', u'Neuroscience', u'Physics', u'Biological Sciences'], []]

Dnmt3L is also a paternal effect gene, i.e., wild type offspring of heterozygous mutant sires display abnormal phenotypes suggesting the inheritance of aberrant epigenetic marks on the paternal chromosomes. In order to reveal the mechanisms underlying these paternal effects, we have assessed X chromosome meiotic compaction, XY chromosome aneuploidy rates and global transcription in meiotic and haploid germ cells from male mice heterozygous for Dnmt3L. XY bodies from Dnmt3L heterozygous males were significantly longer than those from wild types, and were associated with a three-fold increase in XY bearing sperm. Loss of a Dnmt3L allele resulted in deregulated expression of a large number of both X-linked and autosomal genes within meiotic cells, but more prominently in haploid germ cells. Data demonstrate that similar to embryonic stem cells, DNMT3L is involved in an auto-regulatory loop in germ cells wherein the loss of a Dnmt3L allele resulted in increased transcription from the remaining wild type allele. In contrast, however, within round spermatids, this auto-regulatory loop incorporated the alternative non-coding alternative transcripts. Consistent with the mRNA data, we have localized DNMT3L within spermatids and sperm and shown that the loss of a Dnmt3L allele results in a decreased DNMT3L content within sperm. These data demonstrate previously unrecognised roles for DNMT3L in late meiosis and in the transcriptional regulation of meiotic and post-meiotic germ cells. These data provide a potential mechanism for some cases of human Klinefelter's and Turner's syndromes.", u'https://figshare.com/articles/DNMT3L_Is_a_Regulator_of_X_Chromosome_Compaction_and_Post_Meiotic_Gene_Transcription/137815', [u'Developmental Biology', u'Genetics', u'Cancer', u'Physiology'], []]

Most GWAS for T2D have focused on populations of European descent, and GWAS conducted in other populations with different ancestry offer a unique opportunity to study the genetic architecture of T2D. We performed genome-wide association scans for T2D in 3,955 Chinese (2,010 cases, 1,945 controls), 2,034 Malays (794 cases, 1,240 controls), and 2,146 Asian Indians (977 cases, 1,169 controls). In addition to the search for novel variants implicated in T2D, these multi-ethnic cohorts serve to assess the transferability and relevance of the previous findings from European descent populations in the three major ethnic populations of Asia, comprising half of the world's population. Of the SNPs associated with T2D in previous GWAS, only variants at CDKAL1 and HHEX/IDE/KIF11 showed the strongest association with T2D in the meta-analysis including all three ethnic groups. However, consistent direction of effect was observed for many of the other SNPs in our study and in those carried out in European populations. Close examination of the associations at both the CDKAL1 and HHEX/IDE/KIF11 loci provided some evidence of locus and allelic heterogeneity in relation to the associations with T2D. We also detected variation in linkage disequilibrium between populations for most of these loci that have been previously identified. These factors, combined with limited statistical power, may contribute to the failure to detect associations across populations of diverse ethnicity. These findings highlight the value of surveying across diverse racial/ethnic groups towards the fine-mapping efforts for the casual variants and also of the search for variants, which may be population-specific.", u'https://figshare.com/articles/Transferability_of_Type_2_Diabetes_Implicated_Loci_in_Multi_Ethnic___Cohorts_from_Southeast_Asia/137698', [u'Genetics', u'Cancer'], []]

MC is clinically distinct from other multiple exostosis or multiple enchondromatosis syndromes and is unlinked to EXT1 and EXT2, the genes responsible for autosomal dominant multiple osteochondromas (MO). To identify a gene for MC, we performed linkage analysis with high-density SNP arrays in a single family, used a targeted array to capture exons and promoter sequences from the linked interval in 16 participants from 11 MC families, and sequenced the captured DNA using high-throughput parallel sequencing technologies. DNA capture and parallel sequencing identified heterozygous putative loss-of-function mutations in PTPN11 in 4 of the 11 families. Sanger sequence analysis of PTPN11 coding regions in a total of 17 MC families identified mutations in 10 of them (5 frameshift, 2 nonsense, and 3 splice-site mutations). Copy number analysis of sequencing reads from a second targeted capture that included the entire PTPN11 gene identified an additional family with a 15 kb deletion spanning exon 7 of PTPN11. Microdissected MC lesions from two patients with PTPN11 mutations demonstrated loss-of-heterozygosity for the wild-type allele. We next sequenced PTPN11 in DNA samples from 54 patients with the multiple enchondromatosis disorders Ollier disease or Maffucci syndrome, but found no coding sequence PTPN11 mutations. We conclude that heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in PTPN11 are a frequent cause of MC, that lesions in patients with MC appear to arise following a \u201csecond hit,\u201d that MC may be locus heterogeneous since 1 familial and 5 sporadically occurring cases lacked obvious disease-causing PTPN11 mutations, and that PTPN11 mutations are not a common cause of Ollier disease or Maffucci syndrome.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Loss_of_Function_Mutations_in_em_PTPN11_em_Cause_Metachondromatosis_but_Not_Ollier_Disease_or_Maffucci_Syndrome/137547', [u'Medicine', u'Genetics'], []]

Once activated, reconstructed oocytes can be cultured in vitro to blastocyst, the final stage of preimplantation development. However, they often arrest during the early stages of preimplantation development; fail to reprogramme the somatic nucleus; and eliminate the accompanying donor cell's mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in favour of the recipient oocyte's genetically more divergent population. This last point has consequences for the production of ATP by the electron transfer chain, which is encoded by nuclear and mtDNA. Using a murine-porcine interspecies model, we investigated the importance of nuclear-cytoplasmic compatibility on successful development. Initially, we transferred murine fetal fibroblasts into enucleated porcine oocytes, which resulted in extremely low blastocyst rates (0.48%); and failure to replicate nuclear DNA and express Oct-4, the key marker of reprogramming. Using allele specific-PCR, we detected peak levels of murine mtDNA at 0.14\xb10.055% of total mtDNA at the 2-cell embryo stage and then at ever-decreasing levels to the blastocyst stage (<0.001%). Furthermore, these embryos had an overall mtDNA profile similar to porcine embryos. We then depleted porcine oocytes of their mtDNA using 10 \xb5M 2\u2032,3\u2032-dideoxycytidine and transferred murine somatic cells along with murine embryonic stem cell extract, which expressed key pluripotent genes associated with reprogramming and contained mitochondria, into these oocytes. Blastocyst rates increased significantly (3.38%) compared to embryos generated from non-supplemented oocytes (P<0.01). They also had significantly more murine mtDNA at the 2-cell stage than the non-supplemented embryos, which was maintained throughout early preimplantation development. At later stages, these embryos possessed 49.99\xb12.97% murine mtDNA. They also exhibited an mtDNA profile similar to murine preimplantation embryos. Overall, these data demonstrate that the addition of species compatible mtDNA and reprogramming factors improves developmental outcomes for iSCNT embryos.", u'https://figshare.com/articles/Interspecies_Somatic_Cell_Nuclear_Transfer_Is_Dependent_on_Compatible_Mitochondrial_DNA_and_Reprogramming_Factors/137218', [u'Developmental Biology', u'Cell Biology', u'Genetics'], []]

McLean'], u'2015-04-12T17:44:12Z', u"We present a method to measure the relative transmissibility (\u201ctransmission fitness\u201d) of one strain of a pathogen compared to another. The model is applied to data from \u201ccompetitive mixtures\u201d experiments in which animals are co-infected with a mixture of two strains. We observe the mixture in each animal over time and over multiple generations of transmission. We use data from influenza experiments in ferrets to demonstrate the approach. Assessment of the relative transmissibility between two strains of influenza is important in at least three contexts: 1) Within the human population antigenically novel strains of influenza arise and compete for susceptible hosts. 2) During a pandemic event, a novel sub-type of influenza competes with the existing seasonal strain(s). The unfolding epidemiological dynamics are dependent upon both the population's susceptibility profile and the inherent transmissibility of the novel strain compared to the existing strain(s). 3) Neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs), while providing significant potential to reduce transmission of influenza, exert selective pressure on the virus and so promote the emergence of drug-resistant strains. Any adverse outcome due to selection and subsequent spread of an NAI-resistant strain is exquisitely dependent upon the transmission fitness of that strain. Measurement of the transmission fitness of two competing strains of influenza is thus of critical importance in determining the likely time-course and epidemiology of an influenza outbreak, or the potential impact of an intervention measure such as NAI distribution. The mathematical framework introduced here also provides an estimate for the size of the transmitted inoculum. We demonstrate the framework's behaviour using data from ferret transmission studies, and through simulation suggest how to optimise experimental design for assessment of transmissibility. The method introduced here for assessment of mixed transmission events has applicability beyond influenza, to other viral and bacter", u'https://figshare.com/articles/A_Mathematical_Framework_for_Estimating_Pathogen_Transmission_Fitness_and_Inoculum_Size_Using_Data_from_a_Competitive_Mixtures_Animal_Model/137241', [u'Cancer'], []]

The mechanism behind the action of B-WICH is unclear. Here, we show that the B-WICH complex affects the chromatin structure and that silencing of the WSTF protein results in a compaction of the chromatin structure over a 200 basepair region at the rRNA promoter. WSTF knock down does not show an effect on the binding of the rRNA-specific enhancer and chromatin protein UBF, which contributes to the chromatin structure at active genes. Instead, WSTF knock down results in a reduced level of acetylated H3-Ac, in particular H3K9-Ac, at the promoter and along the gene. The association of the histone acetyl-transferases PCAF, p300 and GCN5 with the promoter is reduced in WSTF knock down cells, whereas the association of the histone acetyl-transferase MOF is retained. A low level of H3-Ac was also found in growing cells, but here histone acetyl-transferases were present at the rDNA promoter. We propose that the B-WICH complex remodels the chromatin structure at actively transcribed rRNA genes, and this allows for the association of specific histone acetyl-transferases.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/The_Chromatin_Remodelling_Complex_B_WICH_Changes_the_Chromatin_Structure_and_Recruits_Histone_Acetyl_Transferases_to_Active_rRNA_Genes/137133', [u'Genetics', u'Molecular Biology'], []]

Dun1 also activates DNA-damage-inducible genes by inhibiting the Crt1 transcriptional repressor. Among the genes repressed by Crt1 are three out of four RNR genes: RNR2, RNR3, and RNR4. The fourth RNR gene, RNR1, is also DNA damage-inducible, but is not controlled by Crt1. It has been shown that the deletion of DUN1 is synthetic lethal with the deletion of IXR1, encoding an HMG-box-containing DNA binding protein, but the reason for this lethality is not known. Here we demonstrate that the dun1 ixr1 synthetic lethality is caused by an inadequate RNR activity. The deletion of IXR1 results in decreased dNTP levels due to a reduced RNR1 expression. The ixr1 single mutants compensate for the reduced Rnr1 levels by the Mec1-Rad53-Dun1-Crt1\u2013dependent elevation of Rnr3 and Rnr4 levels and downregulation of Sml1 levels, explaining why DUN1 is indispensible in ixr1 mutants. The dun1 ixr1 synthetic lethality is rescued by an artificial elevation of the dNTP pools. We show that Ixr1 is phosphorylated at several residues and that Ser366, a residue important for the interaction of HMG boxes with DNA, is required for Ixr1 phosphorylation. Ixr1 interacts with DNA at multiple loci, including the RNR1 promoter. Ixr1 levels are decreased in Rad53-deficient cells, which are known to have excessive histone levels. A reduction of the histone gene dosage in the rad53 mutant restores Ixr1 levels. Our results demonstrate that Ixr1, but not Dun1, is required for the proper RNR1 expression both during an unperturbed cell cycle and after DNA d', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Ixr1_Is_Required_for_the_Expression_of_the_Ribonucleotide_Reductase_Rnr1_and_Maintenance_of_dNTP_Pools/136973', [u'Genetics', u'Molecular Biology'], []]

However, the interplay between all these processes occurring simultaneously on the same DNA molecule is still poorly understood. Here, we study the interplay between transcription and HR during ultraviolet light (UV)-induced DNA damage in mammalian cells. Our results show that inhibition of transcription with 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) increases the number of UV-induced DNA lesions (\u03b3H2AX, 53BP1 foci formation), which correlates with a decrease in the survival of wild type or nucleotide excision repair defective cells. Furthermore, we observe an increase in RAD51 foci formation, suggesting HR is triggered in response to an increase in UV-induced DSBs, while inhibiting transcription. Unexpectedly, we observe that DRB fails to sensitise HR defective cells to UV treatment. Thus, increased RAD51 foci formation correlates with increased cell death, suggesting the existence of a futile HR repair of UV-induced DSBs which is linked to transcription inhibition.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Transcription_Inhibition_by_DRB_Potentiates_Recombinational_Repair_of_UV_Lesions_in_Mammalian_Cells/136992', [u'Cell Biology', u'Biochemistry', u'Molecular Biology'], []]
[u'Atmospheric Reaction Systems as Null-Models to Identify Structural Traces of Evolution in Metabolism', ['Petter Holme', 'Mikael Huss', 'Sang Hoon Lee'], u'2011-05-06T01:55:56Z', u"The metabolism is the motor behind the biological complexity of an organism. One problem of characterizing its large-scale structure is that it is hard to know what to compare it to. All chemical reaction systems are shaped by the same physics that gives molecules their stability and affinity to react. These fundamental factors cannot be captured by standard null-models based on randomization. The unique property of organismal metabolism is that it is controlled, to some extent, by an enzymatic machinery that is subject to evolution. In this paper, we explore the possibility that reaction systems of planetary atmospheres can serve as a null-model against which we can define metabolic structure and trace the influence of evolution. We find that the two types of data can be distinguished by their respective degree distributions. This is especially clear when looking at the degree distribution of the reaction network (of reaction connected to each other if they involve the same molecular species). For the Earth's atmospheric network and the human metabolic network, we look into more detail for an underlying explanation of this deviation. However, we cannot pinpoint a single cause of the difference, rather there are several concurrent factors. By examining quantities relating to the modular-functional organization of the metabolism, we confirm that metabolic networks have a more complex modular organization than the atmospheric networks, but not much more. We interpret the more variegated modular arrangement of metabolism as a trace of evolved functionality. On the other hand, it is quite remarkable how similar the structures of these two types of networks are, which emphasizes that the constraints from the chemical properties of the molecules has a larger influence in shaping the reaction system than does natural selection.", u'https://figshare.com/articles/Atmospheric_Reaction_Systems_as_Null_Models_to_Identify_Structural_Traces_of_Evolution_in_Metabolism/136956', [u'Biological Sciences', u'Mathematics', u'Physics'], []]

Birse', 'Dick R. Nassel'], u'2011-05-10T01:55:09Z', u'The insulin-signaling pathway is evolutionarily conserved in animals and regulates growth, reproduction, metabolic homeostasis, stress resistance and life span. In Drosophila seven insulin-like peptides (DILP1-7) are known, some of which are produced in the brain, others in fat body or intestine. Here we show that DILP5 is expressed in principal cells of the renal tubules of Drosophila and affects survival at stress. Renal (Malpighian) tubules regulate water and ion homeostasis, but also play roles in immune responses and oxidative stress. We investigated the control of DILP5 signaling in the renal tubules by Drosophila tachykinin peptide (DTK) and its receptor DTKR during desiccative, nutritional and oxidative stress. The DILP5 levels in principal cells of the tubules are affected by stress and manipulations of DTKR expression in the same cells. Targeted knockdown of DTKR, DILP5 and the insulin receptor dInR in principal cells or mutation of Dilp5 resulted in increased survival at either stress, whereas over-expression of these components produced the opposite phenotype. Thus, stress seems to induce hormonal release of DTK that acts on the renal tubules to regulate DILP5 signaling. Manipulations of S6 kinase and superoxide dismutase (SOD2) in principal cells also affect survival at stress, suggesting that DILP5 acts locally on tubules, possibly in oxidative stress regulation. Our findings are the first to demonstrate DILP signaling originating in the renal tubules and that this signaling is under control of stress-induced release of peptide hormone.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Insulin_Production_and_Signaling_in_Renal_Tubules_of_em_Drosophila_em_Is_under_Control_of_Tachykinin_Related_Peptide_and_Regulates_Stress_Resistance/136909', [u'Molecular Biology', u'Physiology'], []]

Dalton'], u'2011-05-12T01:53:56Z', u'Over the last decade a significant number of studies have highlighted the central role of host antimicrobial (or defence) peptides in modulating the response of innate immune cells to pathogen-associated ligands. In humans, the most widely studied antimicrobial peptide is LL-37, a 37-residue peptide containing an amphipathic helix that is released via proteolytic cleavage of the precursor protein CAP18. Owing to its ability to protect against lethal endotoxaemia and clinically-relevant bacterial infections, LL-37 and its derivatives are seen as attractive candidates for anti-sepsis therapies. We have identified a novel family of molecules secreted by parasitic helminths (helminth defence molecules; HDMs) that exhibit similar biochemical and functional characteristics to human defence peptides, particularly CAP18. The HDM secreted by Fasciola hepatica (FhHDM-1) adopts a predominantly \u03b1-helical structure in solution. Processing of FhHDM-1 by F. hepatica cathepsin L1 releases a 34-residue C-terminal fragment containing a conserved amphipathic helix. This is analogous to the proteolytic processing of CAP18 to release LL-37, which modulates innate cell activation by classical toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We show that full-length recombinant FhHDM-1 and a peptide analogue of the amphipathic C-terminus bind directly to LPS in a concentration-dependent manner, reducing its interaction with both LPS-binding protein (LBP) and the surface of macrophages. Furthermore, FhHDM-1 and the amphipathic C-terminal peptide protect mice against LPS-induced inflammation by significantly reducing the release of inflammatory mediators from macrophages. We propose that HDMs, by mimicking the function of host defence peptides, represent a novel family of innate cell modulators with therapeutic potential in anti-sepsis treatments and prevention of inflammation.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/A_Family_of_Helminth_Molecules_that_Modulate_Innate_Cell_Responses_via_Molecular_Mimicry_of_Host_Antimicrobial_Peptides/136836', [u'Immunology', u'Biochemistry', u'Cancer'], []]

The apparent ambiguity of theoretical and experimental findings may in part be due to experimental shortcomings and/or heterogeneity of scales and methods in earlier studies. This has led to an urgent call for improved and more realistic experiments. In a series of experiments replicated at a global scale we translocated several hundred marine hard bottom communities to new environments simulating a rapid but moderate environmental change. Subsequently, we measured their rate of compositional change (re-structuring) which in the great majority of cases represented a compositional convergence towards local communities. Re-structuring is driven by mortality of community components (original species) and establishment of new species in the changed environmental context. The rate of this re-structuring was then related to various system properties. We show that availability of free substratum relates negatively while taxon richness relates positively to structural persistence (i.e., no or slow re-structuring). Thus, when faced with environmental change, taxon-rich communities retain their original composition longer than taxon-poor communities. The effect of taxon richness, however, interacts with another aspect of diversity, functional richness. Indeed, taxon richness relates positively to persistence in functionally depauperate communities, but not in functionally diverse communities. The interaction between taxonomic and functional diversity with regard to the behaviour of communities exposed to environmental stress may help understand some of the seemingly contrasting findings of past research.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Re_Structuring_of_Marine_Communities_Exposed_to_Environmental_Change_A_Global_Study_on_the_Interactive_Effects_of_Species_and_Functional_Richness/136698', [u'Ecology', u'Inorganic Chemistry'], []]

Age-related non-AIDS co-morbidities in HIV-infected individuals, particularly dementia and cardiovascular disease, result in part from effects of HIV-1 infection on monocyte and macrophage biology. CD163 co-expression on CD14+CD16++ monocytes has been proposed as a useful biomarker for HIV-1 disease progression and the presence of HIV associated dementia. Here we investigated CD163 expression on monocyte subsets ex vivo, on cultured macrophages, and soluble in plasma, in the setting of HIV-1 infection. Whole blood immunophenotyping revealed CD163 expression on CD14++CD16- monocytes but not on CD14+CD16++ monocytes (P\u200a=\u200a0.004), supported by CD163 mRNA levels. Incubation with M-CSF induced CD163 protein expression on CD14+CD16++ monocytes to the same extent as CD14++CD16\u2212 monocytes. CD163 expression on CD14++CD16+ monocytes from HIV-infected subjects was significantly higher than from uninfected individuals, with a trend towards increased expression on CD14++CD16\u2212 monocytes (P\u200a=\u200a0.019 and 0.069 respectively), which is accounted for by HIV-1 therapy including protease inhibitors. Shedding of CD163 was shown to predominantly occur from the CD14++CD16\u2212 subset after Ficoll isolation and LPS stimulation. Soluble CD163 concentration in plasma from HIV-1 infected donors was similar to HIV-1 uninfected donors. Monocyte CD163 expression in HIV-1 infected patients showed a complicated relationship with classical measures of disease progression. Our findings clarify technical issues regarding CD163 expression on monocyte subsets and further elucidates its role in HIV-associated inflammation by demonstrating that CD163 is readily lost from CD14++CD16\u2212 monocytes and induced in pro-inflammatory CD14+CD16++ monocytes by M-CSF. Our data show that all monocyte subsets are potentially capable of differentiating into CD163-expressing anti-inflammatory macrophages given appropriate stimuli. Levels of CD163 expression on monocytes may be a potential biomarker reflecting efforts by the immune system to resolve immune activation and inflammation in HIV-infected individuals.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Differential_Expression_of_CD163_on_Monocyte_Subsets_in_Healthy_and_HIV_1_Infected_Individuals/136602', [u'Immunology', u'Microbiology', u'Cancer', u'Molecular Biology'], []]

[u'A Zebrafish Model of Roberts Syndrome Reveals That Esco2 Depletion Interferes with Development by Disrupting the Cell Cycle', ['Maren Monnich', 'Zoe Kuriger', 'Cristin G. Print', 'Julia A. Horsfield'], u'2011-05-26T01:49:00Z', u'The human developmental diseases Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS) and Roberts Syndrome (RBS) are both caused by mutations in proteins responsible for sister chromatid cohesion. Cohesion is mediated by a multi-subunit complex called cohesin, which is loaded onto chromosomes by NIPBL. Once on chromosomes, cohesin binding is stabilized in S phase upon acetylation by ESCO2. CdLS is caused by heterozygous mutations in NIPBL or cohesin subunits SMC1A and SMC3, and RBS is caused by homozygous mutations in ESCO2. The genetic cause of both CdLS and RBS reside within the chromosome cohesion apparatus, and therefore they are collectively known as \u201ccohesinopathies\u201d. However, the two syndromes have distinct phenotypes, with differences not explained by their shared ontology. In this study, we have used the zebrafish model to distinguish between developmental pathways downstream of cohesin itself, or its acetylase ESCO2. Esco2 depleted zebrafish embryos exhibit features that resemble RBS, including mitotic defects, craniofacial abnormalities and limb truncations. A microarray analysis of Esco2-depleted embryos revealed that different subsets of genes are regulated downstream of Esco2 when compared with cohesin subunit Rad21. Genes downstream of Rad21 showed significant enrichment for transcriptional regulators, while Esco2-regulated genes were more likely to be involved the cell cycle or apoptosis. RNA in situ hybridization showed that runx1, which is spatiotemporally regulated by cohesin, is expressed normally in Esco2-depleted embryos. Furthermore, myca, which is downregulated in rad21 mutants, is upregulated in Esco2-depleted embryos. High levels of cell death contributed to the morphology of Esco2-depleted embryos without affecting specific developmental pathways. We propose that cell proliferation defects and apoptosis could be the primary cause of the features of RBS. Our results show that mutations in different elements of the cohesion apparatus have distinct developmental outcomes, and provide insight into why CdLS and RBS are distinct diseases.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/A_Zebrafish_Model_of_Roberts_Syndrome_Reveals_That_Esco2_Depletion_Interferes_with_Development_by_Disrupting_the_Cell_Cycle/136540', [u'Developmental Biology', u'Genetics', u'Cell Biology', u'Molecular Biology'], []]

Testis cords are formed by E12.5. Germ cells are committed to male development at around E12.5 and enter mitotic arrest between E12.5 and E14.5. This is moderately strain dependent, with germ cells of the outbred CD1 strain entering mitotic arrest slightly earlier than those for the inbred 129T2/SvJ and C57Bl/6 strains.

The penalty of multiple testing implicit in GWAS increases the attraction of complementary approaches for disease gene discovery, including candidate gene- or pathway-based analyses. The strongest candidate loci for additional predisposition SNPs are arguably those already known both to have functional relevance and to be involved in disease risk. To investigate this proposition, we searched for novel CRC susceptibility variants close to the BMP pathway genes GREM1 (15q13.3), BMP4 (14q22.2), and BMP2 (20p12.3) using sample sets totalling 24,910 CRC cases and 26,275 controls. We identified new, independent CRC predisposition SNPs close to BMP4 (rs1957636, P\u200a=\u200a3.93\xd710\u221210) and BMP2 (rs4813802, P\u200a=\u200a4.65\xd710\u221211). Near GREM1, we found using fine-mapping that the previously-identified association between tagSNP rs4779584 and CRC actually resulted from two independent signals represented by rs16969681 (P\u200a=\u200a5.33\xd710\u22128) and rs11632715 (P\u200a=\u200a2.30\xd710\u221210). As low-penetrance predisposition variants become harder to identify\u2014owing to small effect sizes and/or low risk allele frequencies\u2014approaches based on informed candidate gene selection may become increasingly attractive. Our data emphasise that genetic fine-mapping studies can deconvolute associations that have arisen owing to independent correlation of a tagSNP with more than one functional SNP, thus explaining some of the apparently missing heritability of common diseases.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Multiple_Common_Susceptibility_Variants_near_BMP_Pathway_Loci_em_GREM1_em_em_BMP4_em_and_em_BMP2_em_Explain_Part_of_the_Missing_Heritability_of_Colorectal_Cancer/136258', [u'Genetics', u'Chemistry', u'Cancer'], []]

Despite this, there have been few comparative studies aimed at determining the similarities and differences between teratoma susceptible and non-susceptible mouse strains. This study examines the entry of fetal germ cells into the male pathway and mitotic arrest in 129T2/SvJ mice. We find that although the entry of fetal germ cells into mitotic arrest is similar between 129T2/SvJ, C57Bl/6 and CD1 mice, there were significant differences in the size and germ cell content of the testis cords in these strains. In 129T2/SvJ mice germ cell mitotic arrest involves upregulation of p27KIP1, p15INK4B, activation of RB, the expression of male germ cell differentiation markers NANOS2, DNMT3L and MILI and repression of the pluripotency network. The germ-line markers DPPA2 and DPPA4 show reciprocal repression and upregulation, respectively, while FGFR3 is substantially enriched in the nucleus of differentiating male germ cells. Further understanding of fetal male germ cell differentiation promises to provide insight into disorders of the testis and germ cell lineage, such as testis tumour formation and infertility.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Mitotic_Arrest_in_Teratoma_Susceptible_Fetal_Male_Germ_Cells/136272', [u'Developmental Biology', u'Cell Biology', u'Cancer'], []]

The majority of these copy number alterations (CNAs) were confirmed by FISH and found to localize to the interphase rather than metaphase nuclei. Furthermore, the proliferative states of the cells analyzed by FISH were tested by immunofluorescence using an antibody against the proliferation marker pKi67. Interestingly, these experiments showed that, in the vast majority of cases, the changes appeared to be confined to interphase nuclei in a non-proliferative status.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Genomic_Imbalances_Are_Confined_to_Non_Proliferating_Cells_in_Paediatric_Patients_with_Acute_Myeloid_Leukaemia_and_a_Normal_or_Incomplete_Karyotype/136062', [u'Hematology', u'Genetics', u'Cell Biology'], []]

An explanation for this could be due in part to the use of different antibodies in immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent labeling of cells and tissues. The inconsistencies could also be due to poor resolution of immunohistochemical data. We analyzed two cohorts of breast tumours for both abundance and subcellular location of YB-1 using three different antibodies; two targeting N-terminal epitopes (AB-a and AB-b) and another (AB-c) targeting a C-terminal epitope. We also investigated stress-induced nuclear translocation of YB-1 in cell culture. We report that both AB-a and AB-c detected increased YB-1 in the cytoplasm of high-grade breast cancers, and in those lacking estrogen and progesterone receptors; however the amount of YB-1 detected by AB-a in these cancers is significantly greater than that detected by AB-c. We confirm our previously published findings that AB-b is also detecting hnRNP A1, and cannot therefore be used to reliably detect YB-1 by immunohistochemistry. We also report that AB-a detected nuclear YB-1 in some tumour tissues and stress treated cells, whereas AB-c did not. To understand this, cancer cell lines were analyzed using native gel electrophoresis, which revealed that the antibodies detect different complexes in which YB-1 is a component. Our data suggest that different YB-1 antibodies show different staining patterns that are determined by the accessibility of epitopes, and this depends on the nature of the YB-1 complexes. It is important therefore to standardize the protocols if YB-1 is to be used reproducibly as a prognostic guide for different cancers.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Prognostic_Association_of_YB_1_Expression_in_Breast_Cancers_A_Matter_of_Antibody/136051', [u'Cell Biology', u'Cancer', u'Biochemistry', u'Molecular Biology'], []]

[u'Investigating Behaviour and Population Dynamics of Striped Marlin (<em>Kajikia audax</em>) from the Southwest Pacific Ocean with Satellite Tags', ['Tim Sippel', 'John Holdsworth', 'Todd Dennis', 'John Montgomery'], u'2011-06-14T01:39:33Z', u'Behaviour and distribution of striped marlin within the southwest Pacific Ocean were investigated using electronic tagging data collected from 2005\u20132008. A continuous-time correlated random-walk Kalman filter was used to integrate double-tagging data exhibiting variable error structures into movement trajectories composed of regular time-steps. This state-space trajectory integration approach improved longitude and latitude error distributions by 38.5 km and 22.2 km respectively. Using these trajectories as inputs, a behavioural classification model was developed to infer when, and where, \u2018transiting\u2019 and \u2018area-restricted\u2019 (ARB) pseudo-behavioural states occurred. ARB tended to occur at shallower depths (108\xb149 m) than did transiting behaviours (127\xb157 m). A 16 day post-release period of diminished ARB activity suggests that patterns of behaviour were affected by the capture and/or tagging events, implying that tagged animals may exhibit atypical behaviour upon release. The striped marlin in this study dove deeper and spent greater time at \u2265200 m depth than those in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean. As marlin reached tropical latitudes (20\u201321\xb0S) they consistently reversed directions, increased swimming speed and shifted to transiting behaviour. Reversals in the tropics also coincided with increases in swimming depth, including increased time \u2265250 m. Our research provides enhanced understanding of the behavioural ecology of striped marlin. This has implications for the effectiveness of spatially explicit population models and we demonstrate the need to consider geographic variation when standardizing CPUE by depth, and provide data to inform natural and recreational fishing mortality parameters.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Investigating_Behaviour_and_Population_Dynamics_of_Striped_Marlin_em_Kajikia_audax_em_from_the_Southwest_Pacific_Ocean_with_Satellite_Tags/135973', [u'Ecology', u'Neuroscience', u'Inorganic Chemistry'], []]

As such, it is a major relay in the ascending auditory pathway of all birds and in songbirds mediates the auditory feedback necessary for the learning and maintenance of song. To clarify the organization of MLd, we applied three calcium binding protein antibodies to tissue sections from the brains of adult male and female zebra finches. The staining patterns resulting from the application of parvalbumin, calbindin and calretinin antibodies differed from each other and in different parts of the nucleus. Parvalbumin-like immunoreactivity was distributed throughout the whole nucleus, as defined by the totality of the terminations of brainstem auditory afferents; in other words parvalbumin-like immunoreactivity defines the boundaries of MLd. Staining patterns of parvalbumin, calbindin and calretinin defined two regions of MLd: inner (MLd.I) and outer (MLd.O). MLd.O largely surrounds MLd.I and is distinct from the surrounding intercollicular nucleus. Unlike the case in some non-songbirds, however, the two MLd regions do not correspond to the terminal zones of the projections of the brainstem auditory nuclei angularis and laminaris, which have been found to overlap substantially throughout the nucleus in zebra finches.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Subdivisions_of_the_Auditory_Midbrain_N_Mesencephalicus_Lateralis_pars_dorsalis_in_Zebra_Finches_Using_Calcium_Binding_Protein_Immunocytochemistry/135830', [u'Neuroscience', u'Physiology'], []]

In plants, most imprinted genes have been identified in Arabidopsis endosperm, a transient structure consumed by the embryo during seed formation. We identified imprinted genes in rice seed where both the endosperm and embryo are present at seed maturity. RNA was extracted from embryos and endosperm of seeds obtained from reciprocal crosses between two subspecies Nipponbare (Japonica rice) and 93-11 (Indica rice). Sequenced reads from cDNA libraries were aligned to their respective parental genomes using single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Reads across SNPs enabled derivation of parental expression bias ratios. A continuum of parental expression bias states was observed. Statistical analyses indicated 262 candidate imprinted loci in the endosperm and three in the embryo (168 genic and 97 non-genic). Fifty-six of the 67 loci investigated were confirmed to be imprinted in the seed. Imprinted loci are not clustered in the rice genome as found in mammals. All of these imprinted loci were expressed in the endosperm, and one of these was also imprinted in the embryo, confirming that in both rice and Arabidopsis imprinted expression is primarily confined to the endosperm. Some rice imprinted genes were also expressed in vegetative tissues, indicating that they have additional roles in plant growth. Comparison of candidate imprinted genes found in rice with imprinted candidate loci obtained from genome-wide surveys of imprinted genes in Arabidopsis to date shows a low degree of conservation, suggesting that imprinting has evolved independently in eudicots and monocots.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/A_Genome_Wide_Survey_of_Imprinted_Genes_in_Rice_Seeds_Reveals_Imprinting_Primarily_Occurs_in_the_Endosperm/135709', [u'Biological Sciences', u'Medicine'], []]

The precise mechanisms and functions of bacterial auto-aggregation still remain to be fully elucidated. In this work, we characterize the role of a meningococcal hypothetical protein, NMB0995/NMC0982, and show that this protein, here denoted NafA, acts as an anti-aggregation factor. NafA was confirmed to be surface exposed and was found to be induced at a late stage of bacterial adherence to epithelial cells. A NafA deficient mutant was hyperpiliated and formed bundles of pili. Further, the mutant displayed increased adherence to epithelial cells when compared to the wild-type strain. In the absence of host cells, the NafA deficient mutant was more aggregative than the wild-type strain. The in vivo role of NafA in sepsis was studied in a murine model of meningococcal disease. Challenge with the NafA deficient mutant resulted in lower bacteremia levels and mortality when compared to the wild-type strain. The present study reveals that meningococcal NafA is an anti-aggregation factor with strong impact on the disease outcome. These data also suggest that appropriate bacterial auto-aggregation is controlled by both aggregation and anti-aggregation factors during Neisseria infection in vivo.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/NafA_Negatively_Controls_em_Neisseria_meningitidis_em_Piliation/135453', [u'Microbiology'], []]

Employing a rat model of maternal high fat (MHF) nutrition, we recently reported that offspring born to MHF mothers are small at birth and develop a postnatal phenotype that closely resembles that of the human metabolic syndrome. Livers of offspring born to MHF mothers also display a fatty phenotype reflecting hepatic steatosis and characteristics of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. In the present study we hypothesised that a MHF diet leads to altered regulation of liver development in offspring; a derangement that may be detectable during early postnatal life. Livers were collected at postnatal days 2 (P2) and 27 (P27) from male offspring of control and MHF mothers (n\u200a=\u200a8 per group). Cell cycle dynamics, measured by flow cytometry, revealed significant G0/G1 arrest in the livers of P2 offspring born to MHF mothers, associated with an increased expression of the hepatic cell cycle inhibitor Cdkn1a. In P2 livers, Cdkn1a was hypomethylated at specific CpG dinucleotides and first exon in offspring of MHF mothers and was shown to correlate with a demonstrable increase in mRNA expression levels. These modifications at P2 preceded observable reductions in liver weight and liver\u2236brain weight ratio at P27, but there were no persistent changes in cell cycle dynamics or DNA methylation in MHF offspring at this time. Since Cdkn1a up-regulation has been associated with hepatocyte growth in pathologic states, our data may be suggestive of early hepatic dysfunction in neonates born to high fat fed mothers. It is likely that these offspring are predisposed to long-term hepatic dysfunction.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Offspring_of_Mothers_Fed_a_High_Fat_Diet_Display_Hepatic_Cell_Cycle_Inhibition_and_Associated_Changes_in_Gene_Expression_and_DNA_Methylation/135288', [u'Developmental Biology', u'Genetics', u'Physiology'], []]

A virus-encoded enterotoxin, NSP4 is proposed to play a major role in causing RV diarrhoea but how RV can induce emesis, a hallmark of the illness, remains unresolved. In this study we have addressed the hypothesis that RV-induced secretion of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) by enterochromaffin (EC) cells plays a key role in the emetic reflex during RV infection resulting in activation of vagal afferent nerves connected to nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) and area postrema in the brain stem, structures associated with nausea and vomiting. Our experiments revealed that RV can infect and replicate in human EC tumor cells ex vivo and in vitro and are localized to both EC cells and infected enterocytes in the close vicinity of EC cells in the jejunum of infected mice. Purified NSP4, but not purified virus particles, evoked release of 5-HT within 60 minutes and increased the intracellular Ca2+ concentration in a human midgut carcinoid EC cell line (GOT1) and ex vivo in human primary carcinoid EC cells concomitant with the release of 5-HT. Furthermore, NSP4 stimulated a modest production of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3), but not of cAMP. RV infection in mice induced Fos expression in the NTS, as seen in animals which vomit after administration of chemotherapeutic drugs. The demonstration that RV can stimulate EC cells leads us to propose that RV disease includes participation of 5-HT, EC cells, the enteric nervous system and activation of vagal afferent nerves to brain structures associated with nausea and vomiting. This hypothesis is supported by treating vomiting in children with acute gastroenteritis with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Rotavirus_Stimulates_Release_of_Serotonin_5_HT_from_Human_Enterochromaffin_Cells_and_Activates_Brain_Structures_Involved_in_Nausea_and_Vomiting/135193', [u'Cancer'], []]

It seems possible that the released 5-HT may activate both intrinsic afferents of the ENS as well as extrinsic afferent nerves. It is proposed that the stimulated intrinsic afferents constitute part of a nervous secretory reflex within ENS (left part of panel B), causing an intestinal fluid loss. Stimulation of extrinsic vagal afferents, activates NTS, a brain structure associated with nausea and vomiting (right part of panel B).

Typhi is almost exclusively conferred by self-transmissible IncHI1 plasmids carrying a suite of antimicrobial resistance genes. We identified over 300 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within conserved regions of the IncHI1 plasmid, and genotyped both plasmid and chromosomal SNPs in over 450 S. Typhi dating back to 1958. Prior to 1995, a variety of IncHI1 plasmid types were detected in distinct S. Typhi haplotypes. Highly similar plasmids were detected in co-circulating S. Typhi haplotypes, indicative of plasmid transfer. In contrast, from 1995 onwards, 98% of MDR S. Typhi were plasmid sequence type 6 (PST6) and S. Typhi haplotype H58, indicating recent global spread of a dominant MDR clone. To investigate whether PST6 conferred a selective advantage compared to other IncHI1 plasmids, we used a phenotyping array to compare the impact of IncHI1 PST6 and PST1 plasmids in a common S. Typhi host. The PST6 plasmid conferred the ability to grow in high salt medium (4.7% NaCl), which we demonstrate is due to the presence in PST6 of the Tn6062 transposon encoding BetU.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Emergence_of_a_Globally_Dominant_IncHI1_Plasmid_Type_Associated_with_Multiple_Drug_Resistant_Typhoid/135051', [u'Evolutionary Biology', u'Chemistry', u'Cancer'], []]

Draft genome sequences were produced for MAP isolates derived from four CD patients, one ulcerative colitis (UC) patient, and two non-inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) control individuals using Illumina sequencing, complemented by comparative genome hybridisation (CGH). MAP isolates derived from two bovine and one ovine host were also subjected to whole genome sequencing and CGH. All seven human derived MAP isolates were highly genetically similar and clustered together with one bovine type isolate following phylogenetic analysis. Three other sequenced isolates (including the reference bovine derived isolate K10) were genetically distinct. The human isolates contained two large tandem duplications, the organisations of which were confirmed by PCR. Designated vGI-17 and vGI-18 these duplications spanned 63 and 109 open reading frames, respectively. PCR screening of over 30 additional MAP isolates (3 human derived, 27 animal derived and one environmental isolate) confirmed that vGI-17 and vGI-18 are common across many isolates. Quantitative real-time PCR of vGI-17 demonstrated that the proportion of cells containing the vGI-17 duplication varied between 0.01 to 15% amongst isolates with human isolates containing a higher proportion of vGI-17 compared to most animal isolates. These findings suggest these duplications are transient genomic rearrangements. We hypothesise that the over-representation of vGI-17 in human derived MAP strains may enhance their ability to infect or persist within a human host by increasing genome redundancy and conferring crude regulation of protein expression across biologically important regions.", u'https://figshare.com/articles/Exploring_the_Zoonotic_Potential_of_em_Mycobacterium_avium_em_Subspecies_em_paratuberculosis_em_through_Comparative_Genomics/134922', [u'Evolutionary Biology', u'Genetics', u'Biological Sciences', u'Immunology', u'Chemistry', u'Microbiology'], []]

We investigated the association of common genetic variation with plasma phospholipid levels of the four major n-3 PUFAs by performing genome-wide association studies in five population-based cohorts comprising 8,866 subjects of European ancestry. Minor alleles of SNPs in FADS1 and FADS2 (desaturases) were associated with higher levels of ALA (p\u200a=\u200a3\xd710\u221264) and lower levels of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, p\u200a=\u200a5\xd710\u221258) and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA, p\u200a=\u200a4\xd710\u2212154).

Here, we show that \u03b2-ARs inhibit calcium depletion-induced cell contractility and subsequent cell detachment of L6 skeletal muscle cells. The mechanism underlying the cell detachment inhibition was studied by using a quantitative cell detachment assay. We demonstrate that cell detachment induced by depletion of extracellular calcium is due to myosin- and ROCK-dependent contractility. The \u03b2-AR inhibition of L6 skeletal muscle cell detachment was shown to be mediated by the \u03b22-AR and increased cAMP but was surprisingly not dependent on the classical downstream effectors PKA or Epac, nor was it dependent on PKG, PI3K or PKC. However, inhibition of potassium channels blocks the \u03b22-AR mediated effects. Furthermore, activation of potassium channels fully mimicked the results of \u03b22-AR activation. In conclusion, we present a novel finding that \u03b22-AR signaling inhibits contractility and thus cell detachment in L6 skeletal muscle cells by a cAMP and potassium channel dependent mechanism.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/_Adrenergic_Inhibition_of_Contractility_in_L6_Skeletal_Muscle_Cells/134741', [u'Molecular Biology', u'Physiology'], []]

Using genome-wide SNP data on 5174 Swedes with extensive geographical coverage, we analyzed the genetic structure of the Swedish population. We observed strong differences between the far northern counties and the remaining counties. The population of Dalarna county, in north middle Sweden, which borders southern Norway, also appears to differ markedly from other counties, possibly due to this county having more individuals with remote Finnish or Norwegian ancestry than other counties. An analysis of genetic differentiation (based on pairwise Fst) indicated that the population of Sweden's southernmost counties are genetically closer to the HapMap CEU samples of Northern European ancestry than to the populations of Sweden's northernmost counties. In a comparison of extended homozygous segments, we detected a clear divide between southern and northern Sweden with small differences between the southern counties and considerably more segments in northern Sweden. Both the increased degree of homozygosity in the north and the large genetic differences between the south and the north may have arisen due to a small population in the north and the vast geographical distances between towns and villages in the north, in contrast to the more densely settled southern parts of Sweden. Our findings have implications for future genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with respect to the matching of cases and controls and the need for within-county matching. We have shown that genetic differences within a single country may be substantial, even when viewed on a European scale. Thus, population stratification needs to be accounted for, even within a country like Sweden, which is often perceived to be relatively homogenous and a favourable resource for genetic mapping, otherwise inferences based on genetic data may lead to false conclusions.", u'https://figshare.com/articles/The_Genetic_Structure_of_the_Swedish_Population/134535', [u'Evolutionary Biology', u'Genetics', u'Biological Sciences'], []]

The clinical value of quantitation of memory B cells as an indicator of splenic abnormality or risk of infection has been unclear. To assess changes in B cell sub-populations after splenectomy we studied patients recruited to a spleen registry (n\u200a=\u200a591). A subset of 209 adult asplenic or hyposplenic subjects, and normal controls (n\u200a=\u200a140) were tested for IgM memory B cells. We also determined a) changes in IgM memory B cells with time after splenectomy using the cross-sectional data from patients on the registry and b) the kinetics of changes in haematological markers associated with splenectomy(n\u200a=\u200a45). Total B cells in splenectomy patients did not differ from controls, but memory B cells, IgM memory B cells and switched B cells were significantly (p<0.001) reduced. The reduction was similar for different indications for splenectomy. Changes of asplenia in routine blood films including presence of Howell-Jolly bodies (HJB), occurred early (median 25 days) and splenectomy associated thrombocytosis and lymphocytosis peaked by 50 days. There was a more gradual decrease in IgM memory B cells reaching a stable level within 6 months after splenectomy. IgM memory B cells as proportion of B cells was the best discriminator between splenectomized patients and normal controls and at the optimal cut-off of 4.53, showed a true positive rate of 95% and false positive rate of 20%. In a survey of 152 registry patients stratified by IgM memory B cells around this cut-off there was no association with minor infections and no registry patients experienced OPSI during the study. Despite significant changes after splenectomy, conventional measures of IgM memory cells have limited clinical utility in this population.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Splenectomy_Associated_Changes_in_IgM_Memory_B_Cells_in_an_Adult_Spleen_Registry_Cohort/134540', [u'Immunology', u'Medicine', u'Cancer'], []]

Iwaniuk'], u'2011-08-10T01:12:58Z', u"The shift from a diurnal to nocturnal lifestyle in vertebrates is generally associated with either enhanced visual sensitivity or a decreased reliance on vision. Within birds, most studies have focused on differences in the visual system across all birds with respect to nocturnality-diurnality. The critically endangered Kakapo (Strigops habroptilus), a parrot endemic to New Zealand, is an example of a species that has evolved a nocturnal lifestyle in an otherwise diurnal lineage, but nothing is known about its' visual system. Here, we provide a detailed morphological analysis of the orbits, brain, eye, and retina of the Kakapo and comparisons with other birds. Morphometric analyses revealed that the Kakapo's orbits are significantly more convergent than other parrots, suggesting an increased binocular overlap in the visual field. The Kakapo exhibits an eye shape that is consistent with other nocturnal birds, including owls and nightjars, but is also within the range of the diurnal parrots. With respect to the brain, the Kakapo has a significantly smaller optic nerve and tectofugal visual pathway. Specifically, the optic tectum, nucleus rotundus and entopallium were significantly reduced in relative size compared to other parrots. There was no apparent reduction to the thalamofugal visual pathway. Finally, the retinal morphology of the Kakapo is similar to that of both diurnal and nocturnal birds, suggesting a retina that is specialised for a crepuscular niche. Overall, this suggests that the Kakapo has enhanced light sensitivity, poor visual acuity and a larger binocular field than other parrots. We conclude that the Kakapo possesses a visual system unlike that of either strictly nocturnal or diurnal birds and therefore does not adhere to the traditional view of the evolution of nocturnality in birds.", u'https://figshare.com/articles/Anatomical_Specializations_for_Nocturnality_in_a_Critically_Endangered_Parrot_the_Kakapo_em_Strigops_habroptilus_em_/134378', [u'Evolutionary Biology', u'Neuroscience', u'Physiology'], []]

There is evidence that BM microenvironment contains hypoxic areas that confer survival advantage to hematopoietic cells. In the present study we investigated whether hypoxia in leukemic BM contributes to the protective role of the BM microenvironment. We observed a marked expansion of hypoxic BM areas in immunodeficient mice engrafted with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells. Consistent with this finding, we found that hypoxia promotes chemoresistance in various ALL derived cell lines. These findings suggest to employ hypoxia-activated prodrugs to eliminate leukemia cells within hypoxic niches. Using several xenograft models, we demonstrated that administration of the hypoxia-activated dinitrobenzamide mustard, PR-104 prolonged survival and decreased leukemia burden of immune-deficient mice injected with primary acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. Together, these findings strongly suggest that targeting hypoxia in leukemic BM is feasible and may significantly improve leukemia therapy.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Pronounced_Hypoxia_in_Models_of_Murine_and_Human_Leukemia_High_Efficacy_of_Hypoxia_Activated_Prodrug_PR_104/134356', [u'Hematology', u'Cancer'], []]

Furthermore, increasing evidence \u2013 both genetic and functional \u2013 indicates that many of its protein interaction partners are also involved in the development of these diseases. In this study, we applied a pooled sample 454 sequencing strategy, to explore the contribution of genetic variation in DISC1 and 10 of its interaction partners (ATF5, Grb2, FEZ1, LIS-1, PDE4B, NDE1, NDEL1, TRAF3IP1, YWHAE, and ZNF365) to schizophrenia susceptibility in an isolated northern Swedish population. Mutation burden analysis of the identified variants in a population of 486 SZ patients and 514 control individuals, revealed that non-synonymous rare variants with a MAF<0.01 were significantly more present in patients compared to controls (8.64% versus 4.7%, P\u200a=\u200a0.018), providing further evidence for the involvement of DISC1 and some of its interaction partners in psychiatric disorders. This increased burden of rare missense variants was even more striking in a subgroup of early onset patients (12.9% versus 4.7%, P\u200a=\u200a0.0004), highlighting the importance of studying subgroups of patients and identifying endophenotypes. Upon investigation of the potential functional effects associated with the identified missense variants, we found that \u223c90% of these variants reside in intrinsically disordered protein regions. The observed increase in mutation burden in patients provides further support for the role of the DISC1 pathway in schizophrenia. Furthermore, this study presents the first evidence supporting the involvement of mutations within intrinsically disordered protein regions in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders. As many important biological functions depend directly on the disordered state, alteration of this disorder in key pathways may represent an intriguing new disease mechanism for schizophrenia and related neuropsychiatric dis', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Sequencing_of_DISC1_Pathway_Genes_Reveals_Increased_Burden_of_Rare_Missense_Variants_in_Schizophrenia_Patients_from_a_Northern_Swedish_Population/134430', [u'Genetics', u'Mental Health'], []]

A detailed in vitro characterization is often restricted by the low cell numbers of circulating EPCs. Therefore in vitro culturing and expansion methods are applied, which allow at least distinguishing two different types of EPCs, early and late EPCs. Herein, we describe an in vitro culture technique with the aim to generate high numbers of phenotypically, functionally and genetically defined early EPCs from human cord blood. Characterization of EPCs was done by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence microscopy, colony forming unit (CFU) assay and endothelial tube formation assay. There was an average 48-fold increase in EPC numbers. EPCs expressed VEGFR-2, CD144, CD18, and CD61, and were positive for acetylated LDL uptake and ulex lectin binding. The cells stimulated endothelial tube formation only in co-cultures with mature endothelial cells and formed CFUs. Microarray analysis revealed highly up-regulated genes, including LL-37 (CAMP), PDK4, and alpha-2-macroglobulin. In addition, genes known to be associated with cardioprotective (GDF15) or pro-angiogenic (galectin-3) properties were also significantly up-regulated after a 72 h differentiation period on fibronectin. We present a novel method that allows to generate high numbers of phenotypically, functionally and genetically characterized early EPCs. Furthermore, we identified several genes newly linked to EPC differentiation, among them LL-37 (CAMP) was the most up-regulated gene.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Successful_In_Vitro_Expansion_and_Differentiation_of_Cord_Blood_Derived_CD34_Cells_into_Early_Endothelial_Progenitor_Cells_Reveals_Highly_Differential_Gene_Expression/134295', [u'Developmental Biology', u'Genetics', u'Cell Biology'], []]

[u'<em>Hox10</em> Genes Function in Kidney Development in the Differentiation and Integration of the Cortical Stroma', ['Alisha R. Yallowitz', 'Steven M. Hrycaj', 'Kieran M. Short', 'Ian M. Smyth', 'Deneen M. Wellik'], u'2011-08-16T01:10:43Z', u'Organogenesis requires the differentiation and integration of distinct populations of cells to form a functional organ. In the kidney, reciprocal interactions between the ureter and the nephrogenic mesenchyme are required for organ formation. Additionally, the differentiation and integration of stromal cells are also necessary for the proper development of this organ. Much remains to be understood regarding the origin of cortical stromal cells and the pathways involved in their formation and function. By generating triple mutants in the Hox10 paralogous group genes, we demonstrate that Hox10 genes play a critical role in the developing kidney. Careful examination of control kidneys show that Foxd1-expressing stromal precursor cells are first observed in a cap-like pattern anterior to the metanephric mesenchyme and these cells subsequently integrate posteriorly into the kidney periphery as development proceeds. While the initial cap-like pattern of Foxd1-expressing cortical stromal cells is unaffected in Hox10 mutants, these cells fail to become properly integrated into the kidney, and do not differentiate to form the kidney capsule. Consistent with loss of cortical stromal cell function, Hox10 mutant kidneys display reduced and aberrant ureter branching, decreased nephrogenesis. These data therefore provide critical novel insights into the cellular and genetic mechanisms governing cortical cell development during kidney organogenesis. These results, combined with previous evidence demonstrating that Hox11 genes are necessary for patterning the metanephric mesenchyme, support a model whereby distinct populations in the nephrogenic cord are regulated by unique Hox codes, and that differential Hox function along the AP axis of the nephrogenic cord is critical for the differentiation and integration of these cell types during kidney organogenesis.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/_em_Hox10_em_Genes_Function_in_Kidney_Development_in_the_Differentiation_and_Integration_of_the_Cortical_Stroma/134243', [u'Developmental Biology', u'Genetics'], []]

These attributes have made these species models for understanding the complexity of necrotrophic, broad host-range pathogenicity. Despite their similarities, the two species differ in mating behaviour and the ability to produce asexual spores. We have sequenced the genomes of one strain of S. sclerotiorum and two strains of B. cinerea. The comparative analysis of these genomes relative to one another and to other sequenced fungal genomes is provided here. Their 38\u201339 Mb genomes include 11,860\u201314,270 predicted genes, which share 83% amino acid identity on average between the two species. We have mapped the S. sclerotiorum assembly to 16 chromosomes and found large-scale co-linearity with the B. cinerea genomes. Seven percent of the S. sclerotiorum genome comprises transposable elements compared to <1% of B. cinerea. The arsenal of genes associated with necrotrophic processes is similar between the species, including genes involved in plant cell wall degradation and oxalic acid production. Analysis of secondary metabolism gene clusters revealed an expansion in number and diversity of B. cinerea\u2013specific secondary metabolites relative to S. sclerotiorum. The potential diversity in secondary metabolism might be involved in adaptation to specific ecological niches. Comparative genome analysis revealed the basis of differing sexual mating compatibility systems between S. sclerotiorum and B. cinerea. The organization of the mating-type loci differs, and their structures provide evidence for the evolution of heterothallism from homothallism. These data shed light on the evolutionary and mechanistic bases of the genetically complex traits of necrotrophic pathogenicity and sexual mating.

The principle mechanism for pathogenesis in hospital environments involves the formation of biofilms, primarily on implanted medical devices. In this study, we constructed a transposon mutant library in a clinical isolate, K. pneumoniae AJ218, to identify the genes and pathways implicated in biofilm formation. Three mutants severely defective in biofilm formation contained insertions within the mrkABCDF genes encoding the main structural subunit and assembly machinery for type 3 fimbriae. Two other mutants carried insertions within the yfiN and mrkJ genes, which encode GGDEF domain- and EAL domain-containing c-di-GMP turnover enzymes, respectively. The remaining two isolates contained insertions that inactivated the mrkH and mrkI genes, which encode for novel proteins with a c-di-GMP-binding PilZ domain and a LuxR-type transcriptional regulator, respectively. Biochemical and functional assays indicated that the effects of these factors on biofilm formation accompany concomitant changes in type 3 fimbriae expression. We mapped the transcriptional start site of mrkA, demonstrated that MrkH directly activates transcription of the mrkA promoter and showed that MrkH binds strongly to the mrkA regulatory region only in the presence of c-di-GMP. Furthermore, a point mutation in the putative c-di-GMP-binding domain of MrkH completely abolished its function as a transcriptional activator. In vivo analysis of the yfiN and mrkJ genes strongly indicated their c-di-GMP-specific function as diguanylate cyclase and phosphodiesterase, respectively. In addition, in vitro assays showed that purified MrkJ protein has strong c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase activity. These results demonstrate for the first time that c-di-GMP can function as an effector to stimulate the activity of a transcriptional activator, and explain how type 3 fimbriae expression is coordinated with other gene expression programs in K. pneumoniae to promote biofilm formation to implanted medical devices.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/MrkH_a_Novel_c_di_GMP_Dependent_Transcriptional_Activator_Controls_em_Klebsiella_pneumoniae_em_Biofilm_Formation_by_Regulating_Type_3_Fimbriae_Expression/133931', [u'Microbiology', u'Cell Biology', u'Cancer', u'Molecular Biology'], []]

High c-di-GMP levels promote biofilm formation through MrkH:c-di-GMP-dependent transcriptional activation of the mrkABCDF operon encoding type 3 fimbriae. The major pilin subunit MrkA is bound by the MrkB chaperone in the periplasm to activate it for polymerization by the usher translocase MrkC. Once sufficiently elongated, the fimbriae would emerge through the extracellular capsule layer (represented by grey shading surrounding the cell). Conversely, low c-di-GMP levels promote biofilm dispersal and the planktonic state through a decrease in activated MrkH:c-di-GMP availability.

[u'Ethnicity and Population Structure in Personal Naming Networks', ['Pablo Mateos', 'Paul A. Longley', "David O'Sullivan"], u'2011-09-06T01:00:16Z', u'Personal naming practices exist in all human groups and are far from random. Rather, they continue to reflect social norms and ethno-cultural customs that have developed over generations. As a consequence, contemporary name frequency distributions retain distinct geographic, social and ethno-cultural patterning that can be exploited to understand population structure in human biology, public health and social science. Previous attempts to detect and delineate such structure in large populations have entailed extensive empirical analysis of naming conventions in different parts of the world without seeking any general or automated methods of population classification by ethno-cultural origin. Here we show how \u2018naming networks\u2019, constructed from forename-surname pairs of a large sample of the contemporary human population in 17 countries, provide a valuable representation of cultural, ethnic and linguistic population structure around the world. This innovative approach enriches and adds value to automated population classification through conventional national data sources such as telephone directories and electoral registers. The method identifies clear social and ethno-cultural clusters in such naming networks that extend far beyond the geographic areas in which particular names originated, and that are preserved even after international migration. Moreover, one of the most striking findings of this approach is that these clusters simply \u2018emerge\u2019 from the aggregation of millions of individual decisions on parental naming practices for their children, without any prior knowledge introduced by the researcher. Our probabilistic approach to community assignment, both at city level as well as at a global scale, helps to reveal the degree of isolation, integration or overlap between human populations in our rapidly globalising world. As such, this work has important implications for research in population genetics, public health, and social science adding new understandings of migration, identity, integration and social interaction across the world.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Ethnicity_and_Population_Structure_in_Personal_Naming_Networks/133616', [u'Biological Sciences'], []]

Instead, poxvirus immature particles are generated from atypical crescent-shaped precursors whose architecture and composition remain contentious. Here we describe the 2.6 \xc5 crystal structure of vaccinia virus D13, a key structural component of the outer scaffold of viral crescents. D13 folds into two jellyrolls decorated by a head domain of novel fold. It assembles into trimers that are homologous to the double-barrel capsid proteins of adenovirus and lipid-containing icosahedral viruses. We show that, when tethered onto artificial membranes, D13 forms a honeycomb lattice and assembly products structurally similar to the viral crescents and immature particles. The architecture of the D13 honeycomb lattice and the lipid-remodeling abilities of D13 support a model of assembly that exhibits similarities with the giant mimivirus. Overall, these findings establish that the first committed step of poxvirus morphogenesis utilizes an ancestral lipid-remodeling strategy common to icosahedral DNA viruses infecting all kingdoms of life. Furthermore, D13 is the target of rifampicin and its structure will aid the development of poxvirus assembly inhibitors.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Membrane_Remodeling_by_the_Double_Barrel_Scaffolding_Protein_of_Poxvirus/133557', [u'Cancer'], []]

In order to identify the gene responsible for the trigonocephaly component of the 9p22.3 syndrome, a cohort of 109 patients were assessed by high-resolution arrays and MLPA for copy number variations (CNVs) involving 9p22. Five CNVs involving FREM1, all of which were de novo variants, were identified by array-based analyses. The remaining 104 patients with MC were then subjected to targeted FREM1 gene re-sequencing, which identified 3 further mutant alleles, one of which was de novo.

The homeodomain transcription factor Nkx2-5/Csx is essential for heart specification and morphogenesis. It has been previously suggested that SUMOylation of lysine 51 (K51) of Nkx2-5 is essential for its DNA binding and transcriptional activation. Here, we confirm that SUMOylation strongly enhances Nkx2-5 transcriptional activity and that residue K51 of Nkx2-5 is a SUMOylation target. However, in a range of cultured cell lines we find that a point mutation of K51 to arginine (K51R) does not affect Nkx2-5 activity or DNA binding, suggesting the existence of additional Nkx2-5 SUMOylated residues. Using biochemical assays, we demonstrate that Nkx2-5 is SUMOylated on at least one additional site, and this is the predominant site in cardiac cells. The second site is either non-canonical or a \u201cshifting\u201d site, as mutation of predicted consensus sites and indeed every individual lysine in the context of the K51R mutation failed to impair Nkx2-5 transcriptional synergism with SUMO, or its nuclear localization and DNA binding. We also observe SUMOylation of Nkx2-5 cofactors, which may be critical to Nkx2-5 regulation.

[u'A New Dolphin Species, the Burrunan Dolphin <em>Tursiops australis</em> sp. nov., Endemic to Southern Australian Coastal Waters', ['Kate Charlton-Robb', 'Lisa-ann Gershwin', 'Ross Thompson', 'Jeremy Austin', 'Kylie Owen', 'Stephen McKechnie'], u'2011-09-14T01:00:39Z', u'Small coastal dolphins endemic to south-eastern Australia have variously been assigned to described species Tursiops truncatus, T. aduncus or T. maugeanus; however the specific affinities of these animals is controversial and have recently been questioned. Historically \u2018the southern Australian Tursiops\u2019 was identified as unique and was formally named Tursiops maugeanus but was later synonymised with T. truncatus. Morphologically, these coastal dolphins share some characters with both aforementioned recognised Tursiops species, but they also possess unique characters not found in either. Recent mtDNA and microsatellite genetic evidence indicates deep evolutionary divergence between this dolphin and the two currently recognised Tursiops species. However, in accordance with the recommendations of the Workshop on Cetacean Systematics, and the Unified Species Concept the use of molecular evidence alone is inadequate for describing new species. Here we describe the macro-morphological, colouration and cranial characters of these animals, assess the available and new genetic data, and conclude that multiple lines of evidence clearly indicate a new species of dolphin. We demonstrate that the syntype material of T. maugeanus comprises two different species, one of which is the historical \u2018southern form of Tursiops\u2019 most similar to T. truncatus, and the other is representative of the new species and requires formal classification. These dolphins are here described as Tursiops australis sp. nov., with the common name of \u2018Burrunan Dolphin\u2019 following Australian aboriginal narrative. The recognition of T. australis sp. nov. is particularly significant given the endemism of this new species to a small geographic region of southern and south-eastern Australia, where only two small resident populations in close proximity to a major urban and agricultural centre are known, giving them a high conservation value and making them susceptible to numerous anthropogenic threats.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/A_New_Dolphin_Species_the_Burrunan_Dolphin_em_Tursiops_australis_em_sp_nov_Endemic_to_Southern_Australian_Coastal_Waters/133639', [u'Evolutionary Biology', u'Genetics', u'Inorganic Chemistry'], []]

Frequent clonal strains such as the Australian Epidemic Strain-1 (AES-1), have increased ability to establish infection in the CF lung and to superimpose and replace infrequent clonal strains. Little is known about the factors underpinning these properties. Analysis has been hampered by lack of expression array templates containing CF-strain specific genes. We sequenced the genome of an acute infection AES-1 isolate from a CF infant (AES-1R) and constructed a non-redundant micro-array (PANarray) comprising AES-1R and seven other sequenced P. aeruginosa genomes. The unclosed AES-1R genome comprised 6.254Mbp and contained 6957 putative genes, including 338 not found in the other seven genomes. The PANarray contained 12,543 gene probe spots; comprising 12,147 P. aeruginosa gene probes, 326 quality-control probes and 70 probes for non-P. aeruginosa genes, including phage and plant genes. We grew AES-1R and its isogenic pair AES-1M, taken from the same patient 10.5 years later and not eradicated in the intervening period, in our validated artificial sputum medium (ASMDM) and used the PANarray to compare gene expression of both in duplicate. 675 genes were differentially expressed between the isogenic pairs, including upregulation of alginate, biofilm, persistence genes and virulence-related genes such as dihydroorotase, uridylate kinase and cardiolipin synthase, in AES-1M. Non-PAO1 genes upregulated in AES-1M included pathogenesis-related (PAGI-5) genes present in strains PACS2 and PA7, and numerous phage genes. Elucidation of these genes' roles could lead to targeted treatment strategies for chronically infected CF patients.", u'https://figshare.com/articles/_em_Pseudomonas_aeruginosa_em_AES_1_Exhibits_Increased_Virulence_Gene_Expression_during_Chronic_Infection_of_Cystic_Fibrosis_Lung/133278', [u'Microbiology', u'Molecular Biology'], []]

This clinical study assessed retention and duration of antiviral activity following vaginal administration of 3% SPL7013 Gel in healthy women. Participants received 5 single doses of product with \u22655 days between doses. A cervicovaginal fluid (CVF) sample was collected using a SoftCup\u2122 pre-dose, and immediately, or 1, 3, 12 or 24 h post-dose. HIV-1 and HSV-2 antiviral activities of CVF samples were determined in cell culture assays. Antiviral activity in the presence of seminal plasma was also tested. Mass and concentration of SPL7013 in CVF samples was determined. Safety was assessed by reporting of adverse events. Statistical analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test with Bonferroni adjustment; p\u22640.003 was significant. Eleven participants completed the study. Inhibition of HIV-1 and HSV-2 by pre-dose CVF samples was negligible. CVF samples obtained immediately after dosing almost completely inhibited (median, interquartile range) HIV-1 [96% (95,97)] and HSV-2 [86% (85,94)], and activity was maintained in all women at 3 h (HIV-1 [96% (95,98), p\u200a=\u200a0.9]; HSV-2 [94% (91,97), p\u200a=\u200a0.005]). At 24 h, >90% of initial HIV-1 and HSV-2 inhibition was maintained in 6/11 women. SPL7013 was recovered in CVF samples obtained at baseline (46% of 105 mg dose). At 3 and 24 h, 22 mg and 4 mg SPL7013, respectively, were recovered. More than 70% inhibition of HIV-1 and HSV-2 was observed if there was >0.5 mg SPL7013 in CVF samples. High levels of antiviral activity were retained in the presence of seminal plasma. VivaGel was well tolerated with no signs or symptoms of vaginal, vulvar or cervical irritation reported. Potent antiviral activity was observed against HIV-1 and HSV-2 immediately following vaginal administration of VivaGel, with activity maintained for at least 3 h post-dose.

[u'The Core Components of Organelle Biogenesis and Membrane Transport in the Hydrogenosomes of <em>Trichomonas vaginalis</em>', ['Petr Rada', 'Pavel Dolezal', 'Petr L.

It contains an anaerobic form of mitochondria called hydrogenosomes, which produce hydrogen and ATP; the majority of mitochondrial pathways and the organellar genome were lost during the mitochondrion-to-hydrogenosome transition. Consequently, all hydrogenosomal proteins are encoded in the nucleus and imported into the organelles. However, little is known about the membrane machineries required for biogenesis of the organelle and metabolite exchange. Using a combination of mass spectrometry, immunofluorescence microscopy, in vitro import assays and reverse genetics, we characterized the membrane proteins of the hydrogenosome. We identified components of the outer membrane (TOM) and inner membrane (TIM) protein translocases include multiple paralogs of the core Tom40-type porins and Tim17/22/23 channel proteins, respectively, and uniquely modified small Tim chaperones. The inner membrane proteins TvTim17/22/23-1 and Pam18 were shown to possess conserved information for targeting to mitochondrial inner membranes, but too divergent in sequence to support the growth of yeast strains lacking Tim17, Tim22, Tim23 or Pam18. Full complementation was seen only when the J-domain of hydrogenosomal Pam18 was fused with N-terminal region and transmembrane segment of the yeast homolog. Candidates for metabolite exchange across the outer membrane were identified including multiple isoforms of the \u03b2-barrel proteins, Hmp35 and Hmp36; inner membrane MCF-type metabolite carriers were limited to five homologs of the ATP/ADP carrier, Hmp31. Lastly, hydrogenosomes possess a pathway for the assembly of C-tail-anchored proteins into their outer membrane with several new tail-anchored proteins being identified. These results show that hydrogenosomes and mitochondria share common core membrane components required for protein import and metabolite exchange; however, they also reveal remarkable differences that reflect the functional adaptation of hydrogenosomes to anaerobic conditions and the peculiar evolutionary history of the Excavata group.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/The_Core_Components_of_Organelle_Biogenesis_and_Membrane_Transport_in_the_Hydrogenosomes_of_em_Trichomonas_vaginalis_em_/133336', [u'Microbiology', u'Genetics', u'Cell Biology', u'Biochemistry', u'Cancer'], []]

Excavates are exclusively unicellular and are often parasitic eukaryotes, whereas opisthokonts include both unicellular and multicellular organisms, such as fungi and animals. T. vaginalis hydrogenosomes and yeast mitochondria share core components of the outer and inner membranes (Tom40, Sam50, Tim17/22/23, and PAM machinery), although the protein sequences are extremely divergent. The associated components, such as Tom20 and Tom70, and the inner membrane component, Mia40, were not identified in the hydrogenosomes or other excavates, suggesting that these components were not present in the last common mitochondrial ancestor, although a secondary loss cannot be excluded. Conversely, the absence of Erv1 and the reduction of the small Tims family to a single type of highly modified TvTim9/10 most likely reflect the specific adaptation of hydrogenosomes to anaerobic conditions. The assembly of ADP/ATP within the inner hydrogenosomal membrane and the identification of divergent small Tims and Tim17/22/23 proteins indicate that a functional TIM22 complex is present; however, sequence divergence prevented the prediction of whether the Tim17/22/23 proteins form a single multifunctional channel or distinct TIM23 and TIM22 complexes.

Despite the effective phagocytic activity of PMNs, Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections are characterized by high survival within PMNs. We reveal a novel type IV pilus-mediated adherence of pathogenic Neisseria to the uropod (the rear) of polarized PMNs. The direct pilus-uropod interaction was visualized by scanning electron microscopy and total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. We showed that N. meningitidis adhesion to the PMN uropod depended on both pilus-associated proteins PilC1 and PilC2, while N. gonorrhoeae adhesion did not. Bacterial adhesion elicited accumulation of the complement regulator CD46, but not I-domain-containing integrins, beneath the adherent bacterial microcolony. Electrographs and live-cell imaging of PMNs suggested that bacterial adherence to the uropod is followed by internalization into PMNs via the uropod. We also present data showing that pathogenic Neisseria can hitchhike on PMNs to hide from their phagocytic activity as well as to facilitate the spread of the pathogen through the epithelial cell layer.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Pathogenic_em_Neisseria_em_Hitchhike_on_the_Uropod_of_Human_Neutrophils/133271', [u'Immunology', u'Microbiology', u'Cancer'], []]

Some linguists have questioned the suitability of phylogenetic approaches on the grounds that linguistic evolution is largely reticulate due to extensive lateral transmission, or borrowing, among languages. The problem may be particularly pronounced in hunter-gatherer languages, where the conventional wisdom among many linguists is that lexical borrowing rates are so high that tree building approaches cannot provide meaningful insights into evolutionary processes. However, this claim has never been systematically evaluated, in large part because suitable data were unavailable. In addition, little is known about the subsistence, demographic, ecological, and social factors that might mediate variation in rates of borrowing among languages. Here, we evaluate these claims with a large sample of hunter-gatherer languages from three regions around the world. In this study, a list of 204 basic vocabulary items was collected for 122 hunter-gatherer and small-scale cultivator languages from three ecologically diverse case study areas: northern Australia, northwest Amazonia, and California and the Great Basin. Words were rigorously coded for etymological (inheritance) status, and loan rates were calculated. Loan rate variability was examined with respect to language area, subsistence mode, and population size, density, and mobility; these results were then compared to the sample of 41 primarily agriculturalist languages in [1]. Though loan levels varied both within and among regions, they were generally low in all regions (mean 5.06%, median 2.49%, and SD 7.56), despite substantial demographic, ecological, and social variation. Amazonian levels were uniformly very low, with no language exhibiting more than 4%. Rates were low but more variable in the other two study regions, in part because of several outlier languages where rates of borrowing were especially high. High mobility, prestige asymmetries, and language shift may contribute to the high rates in these outliers. No support was found for claims that hunter-gatherer languages borrow more than agriculturalist languages. These results debunk the myth of high borrowing in hunter-gatherer languages and suggest that the evolution of these languages is governed by the same type of rules as those operating in large-scale agriculturalist speech communities. The results also show that local factors are likely to be more critical than general processes in determining high (or low) loan rates.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Does_Lateral_Transmission_Obscure_Inheritance_in_Hunter_Gatherer_Languages_/132956', [u'Evolutionary Biology'], []]

However, the dominant Australian CA-MRSA strain, ST93-IV [2B] appears distantly related to USA300 despite strikingly similar clinical and epidemiological profiles. Here, we compared the virulence of a recent Australian ST93 isolate (JKD6159) to other MRSA, including USA300, and found that JKD6159 was the most virulent in a mouse skin infection model. We fully sequenced the genome of JKD6159 and confirmed that JKD6159 is a distinct clone with 7616 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) distinguishing this strain from all other S. aureus genomes. Despite its high virulence there were surprisingly few virulence determinants. However, genes encoding \u03b1-hemolysin, Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) and \u03b1-type phenol soluble modulins were present. Genome comparisons revealed 32 additional CDS in JKD6159 but none appeared to encode new virulence factors, suggesting that this clone's enhanced pathogenicity could lie within subtler genome changes, such as SNPs within regulatory genes. To investigate the role of accessory genome elements in CA-MRSA epidemiology, we next sequenced three additional Australian non-ST93 CA-MRSA strains and compared them with JKD6159, 19 completed S. aureus genomes and 59 additional S. aureus genomes for which unassembled genome sequence data was publicly available (82 genomes in total). These comparisons showed that despite its distinctive genotype, JKD6159 and other CA-MRSA clones (including USA300) share a conserved repertoire of three notable accessory elements (SSCmecIV, PVL prophage, and pMW2). This study demonstrates that the genetically distinct ST93 CA-MRSA from Australia is highly virulent. Our comparisons of geographically and genetically diverse CA-MRSA genomes suggest that apparent convergent evolution in CA-MRSA may be better explained by the rapid dissemination of a highly conserved accessory genome from a common source.", u'https://figshare.com/articles/The_Dominant_Australian_Community_Acquired_Methicillin_Resistant_em_Staphylococcus_aureus_em_Clone_ST93_IV_2B_Is_Highly_Virulent_and_Genetically_Distinct/132915', [u'Microbiology', u'Genetics', u'Cancer', u'Biological Sciences'], []]

Within tetrapods, a hindlimb-dominant locomotor strategy predominates, and its evolution is considered critical for the evident success of the tetrapod transition onto land. Here, we determine the developmental mechanisms of pelvic fin muscle formation in living fish species at critical points within the vertebrate phylogeny and reveal a stepwise modification from a primitive to a more derived mode of pelvic fin muscle formation. A distinct process generates pelvic fin muscle in bony fishes that incorporates both primitive and derived characteristics of vertebrate appendicular muscle formation.

However, we also discovered that LIGHT-LT\u03b2R interactions suppress anti-parasitic immunity in the liver in the first 7 days of infection by mechanisms that restrict both CD4+ T cell function and TNF-dependent microbicidal mechanisms.

Under normal circumstances LIGHT will interact with HVEM and/or LT\u03b2R to promote anti-parasitic immunity, as well as with DCR3 (not shown). HVEM can also interact with BTLA to suppress immune responses, and can also interact with CD160 and HSV1 gD (not shown). LT\u03b11\u03b22 can also bind to LT\u03b2R and provide signals essential for tissue organising and homeostasis. B. Blockade of LIGHT-HVEM with antibody will prevent HVEM-mediated costimulation and increase HVEM-BTLA-mediated inhibitory signals. LT\u03b2R-mediated inhibitory signals may also be increased via greater interactions with LIGHT. Together, this results in suppression of anti-parasitic immunity. C. Blockade of LIGHT-LT\u03b2R with antibody will potentially prevent LT\u03b2R-mediated inhibitory signals, but will also promote LIGHT-HVEM co-stimulatory signalling and reduce HVEM-BLTA inhibitory signals.

Rood', 'Dena Lyras'], u'2011-10-13T00:40:36Z', u'Nosocomial infections are increasingly being recognised as a major patient safety issue. The modern hospital environment and associated health care practices have provided a niche for the rapid evolution of microbial pathogens that are well adapted to surviving and proliferating in this setting, after which they can infect susceptible patients. This is clearly the case for bacterial pathogens such as Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Vancomycin Resistant Enterococcus (VRE) species, both of which have acquired resistance to antimicrobial agents as well as enhanced survival and virulence properties that present serious therapeutic dilemmas for treating physicians. It has recently become apparent that the spore-forming bacterium Clostridium difficile also falls within this category. Since 2000, there has been a striking increase in C. difficile nosocomial infections worldwide, predominantly due to the emergence of epidemic or hypervirulent isolates that appear to possess extended antibiotic resistance and virulence properties. Various hypotheses have been proposed for the emergence of these strains, and for their persistence and increased virulence, but supportive experimental data are lacking. Here we describe a genetic approach using isogenic strains to identify a factor linked to the development of hypervirulence in C. difficile. This study provides evidence that a naturally occurring mutation in a negative regulator of toxin production, the anti-sigma factor TcdC, is an important factor in the development of hypervirulence in epidemic C. difficile isolates, presumably because the mutation leads to significantly increased toxin production, a contentious hypothesis until now. These results have important implications for C. difficile pathogenesis and virulence since they suggest that strains carrying a similar mutation have the inherent potential to develop a hypervirulent phenotype.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/The_Anti_Sigma_Factor_TcdC_Modulates_Hypervirulence_in_an_Epidemic_BI_NAP1_027_Clinical_Isolate_of_em_Clostridium_difficile_em_/132436', [u'Biological Sciences', u'Medicine'], []]

IR causes changes in transcription, but little is known about alternative transcription in response to IR on a genome-wide basis. These investigations examine the response to IR at the exon level in human cells, using exon arrays to comprehensively characterize radiation-induced transcriptional expression products. Previously uncharacterized alternative transcripts that preferentially occur following IR exposure have been discovered. A large number of genes showed alternative transcription initiation as a response to IR. Dose-response and time course kinetics have also been characterized. Interestingly, most genes showing alternative transcript induction maintained these isoforms over the dose range and times tested. Finally, clusters of co-ordinately up- and down-regulated radiation response genes were identified at specific chromosomal loci. These data provide the first genome-wide view of the transcriptional response to ionizing radiation at the exon level. This study provides novel insights into alternative transcripts as a mechanism for response to DNA damage and cell stress responses in general.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Alternative_Transcript_Initiation_and_Splicing_as_a_Response_to_DNA_Damage/132267', [u'Biophysics', u'Genetics', u'Cell Biology', u'Biological Sciences', u'Molecular Biology'], []]

[u'STDP Allows Fast Rate-Modulated Coding with Poisson-Like Spike Trains', ['Matthieu Gilson', 'Timothee Masquelier', 'Etienne Hugues'], u'2011-10-27T00:32:15Z', u'Spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) has been shown to enable single neurons to detect repeatedly presented spatiotemporal spike patterns. This holds even when such patterns are embedded in equally dense random spiking activity, that is, in the absence of external reference times such as a stimulus onset. Here we demonstrate, both analytically and numerically, that STDP can also learn repeating rate-modulated patterns, which have received more experimental evidence, for example, through post-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs). Each input spike train is generated from a rate function using a stochastic sampling mechanism, chosen to be an inhomogeneous Poisson process here. Learning is feasible provided significant covarying rate modulations occur within the typical timescale of STDP (\u223c10\u201320 ms) for sufficiently many inputs (\u223c100 among 1000 in our simulations), a condition that is met by many experimental PSTHs. Repeated pattern presentations induce spike-time correlations that are captured by STDP. Despite imprecise input spike times and even variable spike counts, a single trained neuron robustly detects the pattern just a few milliseconds after its presentation. Therefore, temporal imprecision and Poisson-like firing variability are not an obstacle to fast temporal coding. STDP provides an appealing mechanism to learn such rate patterns, which, beyond sensory processing, may also be involved in many cognitive tasks.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/STDP_Allows_Fast_Rate_Modulated_Coding_with_Poisson_Like_Spike_Trains/131935', [u'Neuroscience', u'Mathematics', u'Information And Computing Sciences'], []]

The Australian squirrel glider (Petaurus norfolcensis) provides an excellent case study to examine genetic (functional) connectivity among populations. It has an extensive range that occurs in a wide band along the east coast. However, its forest and woodland habitat has become greatly reduced in area and is severely fragmented within the southern inland part of the species' range, where it is recognised as threatened. Within central and northern coastal regions, habitat is much more intact and we thus hypothesise that genetic connectivity will be greater in this region than in the south. To test this we employed microsatellite analysis in a molecular population biology approach. Most sampling locations in the highly modified south showed signatures of genetic isolation. In contrast, a high level of genetic connectivity was inferred among most sampled populations in the more intact habitat of the coastal region, with samples collected 1400 km apart having similar genetic cluster membership. Nonetheless, some coastal populations associated with urbanisation and agriculture are genetically isolated, suggesting the historic pattern observed in the south is emerging on the coast. Our study demonstrates that massive landscape changes following European settlement have had substantial impacts on levels of connectivity among squirrel glider populations, as predicted on the basis of the species' ecology. This suggests that landscape planning and management in the south should be focused on restoring habitat connectivity where feasible, while along the coast, existing habitat connectivity must be maintained and recent losses restored. Molecular population biology approaches provide a ready means for identifying fragmentation effects on a species at multiple scales. Such studies are required to examine the generality of our findings for other tree-dependent species.", u'https://figshare.com/articles/Degree_of_Landscape_Fragmentation_Influences_Genetic_Isolation_among_Populations_of_a_Gliding_Mammal/131897', [u'Evolutionary Biology', u'Genetics', u'Ecology'], []]

However, less than 1% of membrane protein structures are in the Protein Data Bank. In this context, it is important to develop reliable computational methods for predicting the structures of membrane proteins. Here, we present the first application of random forest (RF) for residue-residue contact prediction in transmembrane proteins, which we term as TMhhcp. Rigorous cross-validation tests indicate that the built RF models provide a more favorable prediction performance compared with two state-of-the-art methods, i.e., TMHcon and MEMPACK. Using a strict leave-one-protein-out jackknifing procedure, they were capable of reaching the top L/5 prediction accuracies of 49.5% and 48.8% for two different residue contact definitions, respectively. The predicted residue contacts were further employed to predict interacting helical pairs and achieved the Matthew's correlation coefficients of 0.430 and 0.424, according to two different residue contact definitions, respectively.

However direct confirmation of this has to date been technically challenging. Measures of cellular copper content such as expression levels of copper-responsive genes or cuproenzyme activity levels, while useful, are indirect. First-generation copper-sensitive fluorophores show promise but currently lack the sensitivity required to detect subtle changes in copper levels. Moreover such techniques do not provide information regarding other relevant biometals such as zinc or iron. Traditional techniques for measuring elemental composition such as inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy are not sensitive enough for use with the small tissue amounts available in Drosophila research. Here we present synchrotron x-ray fluorescence microscopy analysis of two different Drosophila tissues, the larval wing imaginal disc, and sectioned adult fly heads and show that this technique can be used to detect changes in tissue copper levels caused by targeted manipulation of known copper homeostasis genes.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Detection_of_Genetically_Altered_Copper_Levels_in_em_Drosophila_em_Tissues_by_Synchrotron_X_Ray_Fluorescence_Microscopy/131976', [u'Genetics', u'Biochemistry', u'Physiology'], []]

Using mutant mouse models that lack c-Rel, the critical NF-\u03baB transcription factor required for nTreg differentiation, we establish that c-Rel regulates both of these developmental steps. c-Rel controls the generation of nTreg precursors via a haplo-insufficient mechanism, indicating that this step is highly sensitive to c-Rel levels. However, maintenance of c-Rel in an inactive state in nTreg precursors demonstrates that it is not required for a constitutive function in these cells. While the subsequent IL-2 induction of Foxp3 in nTreg precursors requires c-Rel, this developmental transition does not coincide with the nuclear expression of c-Rel.

Despite the global scale and inestimable cost of their impacts on both human livelihoods and natural ecosystems, little is known of the global genetic diversity of Black Rats, the timing and directions of their historical dispersals, and the risks associated with contemporary movements. We surveyed mitochondrial DNA of Black Rats collected across their global range as a first step towards obtaining an historical genetic perspective on this socioeconomically important group of rodents. We found a strong phylogeographic pattern with well-differentiated lineages of Black Rats native to South Asia, the Himalayan region, southern Indochina, and northern Indochina to East Asia, and a diversification that probably commenced in the early Middle Pleistocene. We also identified two other currently recognised species of Rattus as potential derivatives of a paraphyletic R. rattus. Three of the four phylogenetic lineage units within R. rattus show clear genetic signatures of major population expansion in prehistoric times, and the distribution of particular haplogroups mirrors archaeologically and historically documented patterns of human dispersal and trade. Commensalism clearly arose multiple times in R. rattus and in widely separated geographic regions, and this may account for apparent regionalism in their associated pathogens. Our findings represent an important step towards deeper understanding the complex and influential relationship that has developed between Black Rats and humans, and invite a thorough re-examination of host-pathogen associations among Black Rats.", u'https://figshare.com/articles/Multiple_Geographic_Origins_of_Commensalism_and_Complex_Dispersal_History_of_Black_Rats/131766', [u'Evolutionary Biology', u'Genetics', u'Cancer'], []]

The four values of u are derived as follows: u1\u200a=\u200a3rd codon position substitutions only, estimate based on results from arvicoline and murine rodents [98]; u2\u200a=\u200alower estimate of substitution rate for all positions within the Rattus Division [100], based on origin of the genus Rattus at 3.0 mya (maximum age suggested by murid-wide analysis of two nuclear genes: IRBP and RAG1); u3\u200a=\u200aupper estimate of substitution rate for all positions within the Rattus Division [100], based on origin of the genus Rattus at 2.0 mya (minimum age suggested by murid-wide analysis of IRBP and RAG1 genes and fossil record); u4\u200a=\u200aestimate of silent divergence rate from comparative analysis of mammalian sequences [99].

The derivation of gene regulatory networks from high-throughput expression data via machine learning strategies is problematic as the reliability of these models is often compromised by limited and highly variable samples, heterogeneity in transcript isoforms, noise, and other artifacts. Here, we develop a novel algorithm, dubbed Dandelion, in which we construct and train intraspecies Bayesian networks that are translated and assessed on independent test sets from other species in a reiterative procedure. The interspecies disease networks are subjected to multi-layers of analysis and evaluation, leading to the identification of the most consistent relationships within the network structure. In this study, we demonstrate the performance of our algorithms on datasets from animal models of oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) and patient materials. We show that the interspecies network of genes coding for the proteasome provide highly accurate predictions on gene expression levels and disease phenotype. Moreover, the cross-species translation increases the stability and robustness of these networks. Unlike existing modeling approaches, our algorithms do not require assumptions on notoriously difficult one-to-one mapping of protein orthologues or alternative transcripts and can deal with missing data. We show that the identified key components of the OPMD disease network can be confirmed in an unseen and independent disease model. This study presents a state-of-the-art strategy in constructing interspecies disease networks that provide crucial information on regulatory relationships among genes, leading to better understanding of the disease molecular mechanisms.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Interspecies_Translation_of_Disease_Networks_Increases_Robustness_and_Predictive_Accuracy/131714', [u'Genetics', u'Biological Sciences', u'Mathematics', u'Information And Computing Sciences'], []]

C. t Hoen'], u'2011-11-03T01:54:06Z', u'The Dandelion algorithm involves three recurring stages of training and independent testing regime with the use of multiple datasets derived from different species. In the first step, disease modules are defined as the most consistently disease-associated molecular pathway across species. The disease module is supplemented by a set of randomly selected genes to assess the performance of the algorithm and to check for overfitting. These datasets are standardized to mean 0 and standard deviation of 1 across genes. The next step involves reiterative selection of one species as an organism in which the gene regulatory network is constructed while others are left aside for independent testing and validation of learnt disease networks. For an intraspecies construction of disease network, dataset is divided into k-folds, using cross-validation, and regulatory relationships between gene transcripts are learnt using Bayesian network methodology enhanced by simulated annealing optimization of network BIC score. After applying confidence thresholds on relationship between genes, the disease network can then be translated to the expected interspecies disease network which we call a network map. Using the cross-validation and network optimization procedure the algorithm searches through the relationships found in the training dataset to find the best fit for interspecies representation of the disease network. These networks are then integrated by removing all the links with low confidence score across species.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Schematic_overview_of_the_Dandelion_algorithm_for_disease_network_analysis_/386846', [u'Genetics', u'Biological Sciences', u'Mathematics', u'Information And Computing Sciences'], []]

Here we have performed high throughput DNA sequencing and comparative genomics for five clinical pairs of vancomycin-susceptible (VSSA) and vancomycin-intermediate ST239 S.\xa0aureus (VISA); each pair isolated before and after vancomycin treatment failure. These comparisons revealed a frequent pattern of mutation among the VISA strains within the essential walKR two-component regulatory locus involved in control of cell wall metabolism. We then conducted bi-directional allelic exchange experiments in our clinical VSSA and VISA strains and showed that single nucleotide substitutions within either walK or walR lead to co-resistance to vancomycin and daptomycin, and caused the typical cell wall thickening observed in resistant clinical isolates. Ion Torrent genome sequencing confirmed no additional regulatory mutations had been introduced into either the walR or walK VISA mutants during the allelic exchange process. However, two potential compensatory mutations were detected within putative transport genes for the walK mutant. The minimal genetic changes in either walK or walR also attenuated virulence, reduced biofilm formation, and led to consistent transcriptional changes that suggest an important role for this regulator in control of central metabolism. This study highlights the dramatic impacts of single mutations that arise during persistent S.\xa0aureus infections and demonstrates the role played by walKR to increase drug resistance, control metabolism and alter the virulence potential of this pathogen.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Evolution_of_Multidrug_Resistance_during_em_Staphylococcus_aureus_em_Infection_Involves_Mutation_of_the_Essential_Two_Component_Regulator_WalKR/131510', [u'Microbiology', u'Genetics', u'Cancer'], []]

Crampin', 'Santiago Schnell'], u'2011-11-11T00:24:25Z', u'One of the main challenges in the biomedical sciences is the determination of reaction mechanisms that constitute a biochemical pathway. During the last decades, advances have been made in building complex diagrams showing the static interactions of proteins. The challenge for systems biologists is to build realistic models of the dynamical behavior of reactants, intermediates and products. For this purpose, several methods have been recently proposed to deduce the reaction mechanisms or to estimate the kinetic parameters of the elementary reactions that constitute the pathway. One such method is MIKANA: Method to Infer Kinetics And Network Architecture. MIKANA is a computational method to infer both reaction mechanisms and estimate the kinetic parameters of biochemical pathways from time course data. To make it available to the scientific community, we developed a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for MIKANA. Among other features, the GUI validates and processes an input time course data, displays the inferred reactions, generates the differential equations for the chemical species in the pathway and plots the prediction curves on top of the input time course data. We also added a new feature to MIKANA that allows the user to exclude a priori known reactions from the inferred mechanism. This addition improves the performance of the method. In this article, we illustrate the GUI for MIKANA with three examples: an irreversible Michaelis\u2013Menten reaction mechanism; the interaction map of chemical species of the muscle glycolytic pathway; and the glycolytic pathway of Lactococcus lactis. We also describe the code and methods in sufficient detail to allow researchers to further develop the code or reproduce the experiments described.

We report that wild-type Drosophila melanogaster (OrR) flies are susceptible to virulent C. albicans infections and have established experimental conditions that enable OrR flies to serve as model hosts for studying C. albicans virulence. After injection into the thorax, wild-type C. albicans cells disseminate and invade tissues throughout the fly, leading to lethality. Similar to results obtained monitoring systemic infections in mice, well-characterized cph1\u0394 efg1\u0394 and csh3\u0394 fungal mutants exhibit attenuated virulence in flies. Using the OrR fly host model, we assessed the virulence of C. albicans strains individually lacking functional components of the SPS sensing pathway. In response to extracellular amino acids, the plasma membrane localized SPS-sensor (Ssy1, Ptr3, and Ssy5) activates two transcription factors (Stp1 and Stp2) to differentially control two distinct modes of nitrogen acquisition (host protein catabolism and amino acid uptake, respectively). Our results indicate that a functional SPS-sensor and Stp1 controlled genes required for host protein catabolism and utilization, including the major secreted aspartyl protease SAP2, are required to establish virulent infections. By contrast, Stp2, which activates genes required for amino acid uptake, is dispensable for virulence. These results indicate that nutrient availability within infected hosts directly influences C. albicans virulence.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Wild_Type_em_Drosophila_melanogaster_em_as_a_Model_Host_to_Analyze_Nitrogen_Source_Dependent_Virulence_of_em_Candida_albicans_em_/131424', [u'Immunology', u'Microbiology', u'Genetics', u'Cancer'], []]

Autophagy is essential for preimplantation development of mouse embryos and cavitation of embryoid bodies. The precise roles of autophagy during early human embryonic development, remain however largely uncharacterized. Since human embryonic stem cells constitute a unique model system to study early human embryogenesis we investigated the occurrence of autophagy in human embryonic stem cells. We have, using lentiviral transduction, established multiple human embryonic stem cell lines that stably express GFP-LC3, a fluorescent marker for the autophagosome. Each cell line displays both a normal karyotype and pluripotency as indicated by the presence of cell types representative of the three germlayers in derived teratomas. GFP expression and labelling of autophagosomes is retained after differentiation. Baseline levels of autophagy detected in cultured undifferentiated hESC were increased or decreased in the presence of rapamycin and wortmannin, respectively. Interestingly, autophagy was upregulated in hESCs induced to undergo differentiation by treatment with type I TGF-beta receptor inhibitor SB431542 or removal of MEF secreted maintenance factors. In conclusion we have established hESCs capable of reporting macroautophagy and identify a novel link between autophagy and early differentiation events in hESC.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Autophagy_in_Human_Embryonic_Stem_Cells/131449', [u'Developmental Biology', u'Cell Biology'], []]

In BRCA1 mutation carriers, accumulation of stem and progenitor cells in normal breast tissue and increased risk of developing tumors of basal-like type suggest that BRCA1 regulates stem/progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation. However, the function of BRCA1 in this process and its link to carcinogenesis remain unknown. Here we depict a molecular mechanism involving BRCA1 and RHAMM that regulates apicobasal polarity and, when perturbed, may increase risk of breast cancer. Starting from complementary genetic analyses across families and populations, we identified common genetic variation at the low-penetrance susceptibility HMMR locus (encoding for RHAMM) that modifies breast cancer risk among BRCA1, but probably not BRCA2, mutation carriers: n\u200a=\u200a7,584, weighted hazard ratio (wHR)\u200a=\u200a1.09 (95% CI 1.02\u20131.16), ptrend\u200a=\u200a0.017; and n\u200a=\u200a3,965, wHR\u200a=\u200a1.04 (95% CI 0.94\u20131.16), ptrend\u200a=\u200a0.43; respectively. Subsequently, studies of MCF10A apicobasal polarization revealed a central role for BRCA1 and RHAMM, together with AURKA and TPX2, in essential reorganization of microtubules. Mechanistically, reorganization is facilitated by BRCA1 and impaired by AURKA, which is regulated by negative feedback involving RHAMM and TPX2. Taken together, our data provide fundamental insight into apicobasal polarization through BRCA1 function, which may explain the expanded cell subsets and characteristic tumor type accompanying BRCA1 mutation, while also linking this process to sporadic breast cancer through perturbation of HMMR/RHAMM.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Interplay_between_BRCA1_and_RHAMM_Regulates_Epithelial_Apicobasal_Polarization_and_May_Influence_Risk_of_Breast_Cancer/131435', [u'Genetics', u'Cancer'], []]

[u'Age-Dependent Changes in the Proteome Following Complete Spinal Cord Transection in a Postnatal South American Opossum (<em>Monodelphis domestica</em>)', ['Natassya M. Noor', 'David L.

Saunders'], u'2011-11-16T00:21:49Z', u'Recovery from severe spinal injury in adults is limited, compared to immature animals who demonstrate some capacity for repair. Using laboratory opossums (Monodelphis domestica), the aim was to compare proteomic responses to injury at two ages: one when there is axonal growth across the lesion and substantial behavioural recovery and one when no axonal growth occurs. Anaesthetized pups at postnatal day (P) 7 or P28 were subjected to complete transection of the spinal cord at thoracic level T10. Cords were collected 1 or 7 days after injury and from age-matched controls. Proteins were separated based on isoelectric point and subunit molecular weight; those whose expression levels changed following injury were identified by densitometry and analysed by mass spectrometry. Fifty-six unique proteins were identified as differentially regulated in response to spinal transection at both ages combined. More than 50% were cytoplasmic and 70% belonged to families of proteins with characteristic binding properties. Proteins were assigned to groups by biological function including regulation (40%), metabolism (26%), inflammation (19%) and structure (15%). More changes were detected at one than seven days after injury at both ages. Seven identified proteins: 14-3-3 epsilon, 14-3-3 gamma, cofilin, alpha enolase, heart fatty acid binding protein (FABP3), brain fatty acid binding protein (FABP7) and ubiquitin demonstrated age-related differential expression and were analysed by qRT-PCR. Changes in mRNA levels for FABP3 at P7+1day and ubiquitin at P28+1day were statistically significant. Immunocytochemical staining showed differences in ubiquitin localization in younger compared to older cords and an increase in oligodendrocyte and neuroglia immunostaining following injury at P28. Western blot analysis supported proteomic results for ubiquitin and 14-3-3 proteins. Data obtained at the two ages demonstrated changes in response to injury, compared to controls, that were different for different functional protein classes. Some may provide targets for novel drug or gene therapies.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Age_Dependent_Changes_in_the_Proteome_Following_Complete_Spinal_Cord_Transection_in_a_Postnatal_South_American_Opossum_em_Monodelphis_domestica_em_/131309', [u'Genetics', u'Cell Biology', u'Neuroscience', u'Molecular Biology', u'Developmental Biology', u'Biochemistry'], []]

Transcriptional and protein analyses demonstrated overlapping expression of Mixl1 and Brachyury during embryonic stem cell differentiation. In vitro protein interaction studies showed that the Mixl1 with Brachyury associated via their DNA-binding domains and gel shift assays revealed that the Brachyury T-box domain bound to Mixl1-DNA complexes. Furthermore, luciferase reporter experiments indicated that association of Mixl1 with Brachyury and related T-box factors inhibited the transactivating potential of Mixl1 on the Gsc and Pdgfr\u03b1 promoters.

Grimmond', 'Roy M. Robins-Browne', 'Michael P. Jennings'], u'2011-12-05T00:14:17Z', u'Many host-adapted bacterial pathogens contain DNA methyltransferases (mod genes) that are subject to phase-variable expression (high-frequency reversible ON/OFF switching of gene expression). In Haemophilus influenzae and pathogenic Neisseria, the random switching of the modA gene, associated with a phase-variable type III restriction modification (R-M) system, controls expression of a phase-variable regulon of genes (a \u201cphasevarion\u201d), via differential methylation of the genome in the modA ON and OFF states. Phase-variable type III R-M systems are also found in Helicobacter pylori, suggesting that phasevarions may also exist in this key human pathogen. Phylogenetic studies on the phase-variable type III modH gene revealed that there are 17 distinct alleles in H. pylori, which differ only in their DNA recognition domain. One of the most commonly found alleles was modH5 (16% of isolates). Microarray analysis comparing the wild-type P12modH5 ON strain to a P12\u0394modH5 mutant revealed that six genes were either up- or down-regulated, and some were virulence-associated. These included flaA, which encodes a flagella protein important in motility and hopG, an outer membrane protein essential for colonization and associated with gastric cancer. This study provides the first evidence of this epigenetic mechanism of gene expression in H. pylori. Characterisation of H. pylori modH phasevarions to define stable immunological targets will be essential for vaccine development and may also contribute to understanding H. pylori pathogenesis.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Phasevarion_Mediated_Epigenetic_Gene_Regulation_in_em_Helicobacter_pylori_em_/130857', [u'Microbiology', u'Genetics', u'Cancer'], []]

[u'Behavioural Response Thresholds in New Zealand Crab Megalopae to Ambient Underwater Sound', ['Jenni A. Stanley', 'Craig A. Radford', 'Andrew G. Jeffs'], u'2011-12-07T00:12:17Z', u'A small number of studies have demonstrated that settlement stage decapod crustaceans are able to detect and exhibit swimming, settlement and metamorphosis responses to ambient underwater sound emanating from coastal reefs. However, the intensity of the acoustic cue required to initiate the settlement and metamorphosis response, and therefore the potential range over which this acoustic cue may operate, is not known. The current study determined the behavioural response thresholds of four species of New Zealand brachyuran crab megalopae by exposing them to different intensity levels of broadcast reef sound recorded from their preferred settlement habitat and from an unfavourable settlement habitat. Megalopae of the rocky-reef crab, Leptograpsus variegatus, exhibited the lowest behavioural response threshold (highest sensitivity), with a significant reduction in time to metamorphosis (TTM) when exposed to underwater reef sound with an intensity of 90 dB re 1 \xb5Pa and greater (100, 126 and 135 dB re 1 \xb5Pa). Megalopae of the mud crab, Austrohelice crassa, which settle in soft sediment habitats, exhibited no response to any of the underwater reef sound levels. All reef associated species exposed to sound levels from an unfavourable settlement habitat showed no significant change in TTM, even at intensities that were similar to their preferred reef sound for which reductions in TTM were observed. These results indicated that megalopae were able to discern and respond selectively to habitat-specific acoustic cues. The settlement and metamorphosis behavioural response thresholds to levels of underwater reef sound determined in the current study of four species of crabs, enables preliminary estimation of the spatial range at which an acoustic settlement cue may be operating, from 5 m to 40 km depending on the species. Overall, these results indicate that underwater sound is likely to play a major role in influencing the spatial patterns of settlement of coastal crab species.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Behavioural_Response_Thresholds_in_New_Zealand_Crab_Megalopae_to_Ambient_Underwater_Sound/130737', [u'Ecology', u'Neuroscience', u'Inorganic Chemistry'], []]

The crows did not spontaneously use stones as tools, but quickly learned to do so, and to choose objects and materials with functional properties. Some crows discarded both inefficient and non-functional objects before observing their effects on the water level. Interestingly, the crows did not learn to discriminate between functional and non-functional objects and materials when there was an arbitrary, rather than causal, link between object and reward. This finding suggests that the crows' performances were not based on associative learning alone. That is, learning was not guided solely by the covariation rate between stimuli and outcomes or the conditioned reinforcement properties acquired by functional objects. Our results, therefore, show that New Caledonian crows can process causal information not only when it is linked to sticks and stick-like tools but also when it concerns the functional properties of novel types of tool.", u'https://figshare.com/articles/New_Caledonian_Crows_Learn_the_Functional_Properties_of_Novel_Tool_Types/130499', [u'Evolutionary Biology', u'Neuroscience'], []]

Partial nucleotide sequences of mitochondrial DNA COI (1,142\u20131,207 bp) and 16S rDNA (535\u2013546 bp) regions were determined for adult and phyllosoma larval samples collected from the Eastern Pacific (EP)(Gal\xe1pagos Islands and its adjacent water), Central Pacific (CP)(Hawaii and Tuamotu) and the Western Pacific (WP)(Japan, Indonesia, Fiji, New Caledonia and Australia). Phylogenetic analyses revealed two distinct large clades corresponding to the geographic origin of samples (EP and CP+WP). No haplotype was shared between the two regional samples, and average nucleotide sequence divergence (Kimura's two parameter distance) between EP and CP+WP samples was 3.8\xb10.5% for COI and 1.0\xb10.4% for 16S rDNA, both of which were much larger than those within samples. The present results indicate that the Pacific population of the pronghorn spiny lobster is subdivided into two distinct populations (Eastern Pacific and Central to Western Pacific), with no gene flow between them. Although the pronghorn spiny lobster have long-lived teleplanic larvae, the vast expanse of Pacific Ocean with no islands and no shallow substrate which is known as the East Pacific Barrier appears to have isolated these two populations for a long time (c.a. 1MY).", u'https://figshare.com/articles/Genetic_Isolation_between_the_Western_and_Eastern_Pacific_Populations_of_Pronghorn_Spiny_Lobster_em_Panulirus_penicillatus_em_/130459', [u'Evolutionary Biology', u'Ecology', u'Biological Sciences', u'Genetics', u'Biochemistry', u'Inorganic Chemistry', u'Physics'], []]

Paradoxically, many Ribosomal proteins (Rps) act as tumour suppressors in Drosophila and vertebrates. To examine how reductions in Rps could lead to tissue overgrowth, we took advantage of the observation that an RpS6 mutant dominantly suppresses the small rough eye phenotype in a cyclin E hypomorphic mutant (cycEJP). We demonstrated that the suppression of cycEJP by the RpS6 mutant is not a consequence of restoring CycE protein levels or activity in the eye imaginal tissue. Rather, the use of UAS-RpS6 RNAi transgenics revealed that the suppression of cycEJP is exerted via a mechanism extrinsic to the eye, whereby reduced Rp levels in the prothoracic gland decreases the activity of ecdysone, the steroid hormone, delaying developmental timing and hence allowing time for tissue and organ overgrowth. These data provide for the first time a rationale to explain the counter-intuitive organ overgrowth phenotypes observed for certain members of the Minute class of Drosophila Rp mutants. They also demonstrate how Rp mutants can affect growth and development cell non-autonomously.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/_em_Drosophila_em_Ribosomal_Protein_Mutants_Control_Tissue_Growth_Non_Autonomously_via_Effects_on_the_Prothoracic_Gland_and_Ecdysone/130489', [u'Developmental Biology', u'Cell Biology'], []]

One mechanism whereby bacteria evade phagocytosis is to produce factors that trigger apoptosis. Here we identify for the first time a meningococcal protein capable of inducing macrophage apoptosis. The conserved meningococcal outer membrane protein NhhA (Neisseria hia/hsf homologue A, also known as Hsf) mediates bacterial adhesion and interacts with extracellular matrix components heparan sulphate and laminin. Meningococci lacking NhhA fail to colonise nasal mucosa in a mouse model of meningococcal disease. We found that exposure of macrophages to NhhA resulted in a highly increased rate of apoptosis that proceeded through caspase activation. Exposure of macrophages to NhhA also led to iNOS induction and nitric oxide production. However, neither nitric oxide production nor TNF-\u03b1 signaling was found to be a prerequisite for NhhA-induced apoptosis. Macrophages exposed to wildtype NhhA-expressing meningococci were also found to undergo apoptosis whereas NhhA-deficient meningococci had a markedly decreased capacity to induce macrophage apoptosis. These data provide new insights on the role of NhhA in meningococcal disease. NhhA-induced macrophage apoptosis could be a mechanism whereby meningococci evade immunoregulatory and phagocytotic actions of macrophages.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Meningococcal_Outer_Membrane_Protein_NhhA_Triggers_Apoptosis_in_Macrophages/129927', [u'Immunology', u'Cancer'], []]

The protein is then translocated across the outer mitochondrial membrane and interacts with the Tim9/10 chaperones in the intermembrane space to be assembled into the mitochondrial inner membrane by the TIM22 complex.

We discovered a novel MCF member, termed Legionellanucleotide carrier Protein (LncP), encoded in the genome of Legionella pneumophila, the causative agent of Legionnaire's disease. LncP was secreted via the bacterial Dot/Icm type IV secretion system into macrophages and assembled in the mitochondrial inner membrane. In a yeast cellular system, LncP induced a dominant-negative phenotype that was rescued by deleting an endogenous ATP carrier. Substrate transport studies on purified LncP reconstituted in liposomes revealed that it catalyzes unidirectional transport and exchange of ATP transport across membranes, thereby supporting a role for LncP as an ATP transporter. A hidden Markov model revealed further MCF proteins in the intracellular pathogens, Legionella longbeachae and Neorickettsia sennetsu, thereby challenging the notion that MCF proteins exist exclusively in eukaryotic organisms.", u'https://figshare.com/articles/_em_Legionella_pneumophila_em_Secretes_a_Mitochondrial_Carrier_Protein_during_Infection/129914', [u'Genetics', u'Biochemistry', u'Cancer'], []]

The 256\xa0nt bsrE RNA encodes a 30 aa toxin. The antitoxin SR5 is a 163\xa0nt antisense RNA. Both genes overlap at their 3\u2032 ends. Overexpression of bsrE causes cell lysis on agar plates, which can be neutralized by sr5 overexpression, whereas deletion of the chromosomal sr5 copy has no effect. SR5 is short-lived with a half-life of \u22487\xa0min, whereas bsrE RNA is stable with a half-life of >80\xa0min. The sr5 promoter is 10-fold stronger than the bsrE promoter. SR5 interacts with the 3\u2032 UTR of bsrE RNA, thereby promoting its degradation by recruiting RNase III. RNase J1 is the main RNase responsible for SR5 and bsrE RNA degradation, and PnpA processes an SR5 precursor to the mature RNA. Hfq stabilizes SR5, but is not required for its inhibitory function. While bsrE RNA is affected by temperature shock and alkaline stress, the amount of SR5 is significantly influenced by various stresses, among them pH, anoxia and iron limitation. Only the latter one is dependent on sigB.

These effects include decreased fasting glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 levels. However, no systemic analysis of telmisartan\u2019s effects on body fat distribution has been performed. We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled telmisartan trials to investigate its effects on body weight, fat distribution, and visceral adipose reduction. Research design and methods: A literature search was performed using Embase, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library between January 1966 and November 2013. Randomized controlled trials in English and meeting the following criterion were included: random assignment of hypertensive participants with overweight/obesity, metabolic syndrome, or glucose intolerance to telmisartan or control therapy group. Results: Of 651 potentially relevant reports, 15 satisfied the inclusion criterion.

A series of co-ordinated research projects (CRPs) has been conducted by the IAEA since 1995 assisting national external audit groups developing national audit programs. The CRP \u2018Development of Quality Audits for Radiotherapy Dosimetry for Complex Treatment Techniques\u2019 was conducted in 2009\u20132012 as an extension of previously developed audit programs. Material and methods. The CRP work described in this paper focused on developing and testing two steps of dosimetry audit: verification of heterogeneity corrections, and treatment planning system (TPS) modeling of small MLC fields, which are important for the initial stages of complex radiation treatments, such as IMRT. The project involved development of a new solid slab phantom with heterogeneities containing special measurement inserts for thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD) and radiochromic films. The phantom and the audit methodology has been developed at the IAEA and tested in multi-center studies involving the CRP participants. Results. The results of multi-center testing of methodology for two steps of dosimetry audit show that the design of audit procedures is adequate and the methodology is feasible for meeting the audit objectives. A total of 97% TLD results in heterogeneity situations obtained in the study were within 3% and all results within 5% agreement with the TPS predicted doses. In contrast, only 64% small beam profiles were within 3\u2009mm agreement between the TPS calculated and film measured doses. Film dosimetry results have highlighted some limitations in TPS modeling of small beam profiles in the direction of MLC leave movements. Discussion. Through multi-center testing, any challenges or difficulties in the proposed audit methodology were identified, and the methodology improved.

U\u2013Pb dating by laser ablation\u2013inductively coupled plasma\u2013mass spectrometry was performed on zircon grains from migmatites to investigate the age of different textural domains. Rare-earth element (REE) partition coefficients between zircon and garnet were compared with those established for different temperatures in order to test for equilibrium growth. Two age domains were identified. In one sample where zircon and garnet coexist, the outer zircon overgrowths yield a mean age of 54.16\xa0\xb1\xa00.29\xa0Ma (mean square weighted deviation (MSWD)\xa0=\xa03.5), whereas intermediate zones, between the core and outer overgrowths, yield an age of 122.7\xa0\xb1\xa01.8\xa0Ma (MSWD\xa0=\xa02.5). Partition coefficients were calculated for REEs between coexisting garnet (two different populations) and zircon using (1) the composition of ca. 54\xa0Ma zircon overgrowths and garnet rims and (2) zircon intermediate zones together with garnet cores. The cores of small garnet grains (garnet A) may have grown in equilibrium with zircon domains of ca. 122\xa0Ma. Both garnet cores and rims of the larger porphyroblasts (garnet B) seem to be in equilibrium with ca. 54\xa0Ma zircon overgrowths. Petrographic observations suggest that crystallization of garnet A occurred during partial melting, placing equilibrium growth and therefore a first migmatitic event during the Early Cretaceous at ca. 122\xa0Ma. This migmatitic event may be related to the collision of the Chort\xeds Block with western Mexico. A second migmatitic event of ca. 54\xa0Ma is suggested by equilibrium growth of large garnets (group B) and the outer zircon overgrowths. The high geothermal gradient necessary for this second migmatitic event might be related to the exhumation of the Xolapa Complex, as a result of the transpression and tectonic transport of the Chort\xeds Block to the southeast from the end of the Mesozoic to most of the Cenozoic.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Petrochronology_of_the_migmatization_event_of_the_Xolapa_Complex_Mexico_microchemistry_and_equilibrium_growth_of_zircon_and_garnet/3120592', [u'Biochemistry', u'Environmental Sciences', u'Chemical Sciences', u'Ecology', u'Sociology', u'Developmental Biology', u'Plant Biology'], []]

The geochemical and isotopic variations along the lava pile are not systematic, implying that the magma chamber could have undergone successive replenishments of basaltic magma. The process of crustal assimilation explains the high and widespread initial Sr isotopic ratios at 0.707798\u20130.715751 and the very low \u03b5Nd at \u22128.36 to \u22125.41, with associated Pb isotopic variations (18.42\xa0<\xa0206Pb/204Pb < 18.86; 15.65\xa0<\xa0207Pb/204Pb\xa0< 15.71; 38.62\xa0<\xa0208Pb/204Pb\xa0<\xa039.37). The magmatic evolution of the SCSH and LJ lava flows begins with the storage of mafic liquids during a short period in the shallow-level magma chamber, which allowed the magma ascent with composition of olivine basalts. The continuous fractional crystallization within the magma chamber coupled with variable assimilation degrees of distinct contaminants with Palaeoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic ages, in addition to significant contribution of magma recharge, led to magma ascent with basaltic andesite composition that displays at surface a simple pahoehoe morphology. The continuous magma recharge in the magma chamber coupled with higher assimilation degree allowed the formation of basaltic andesite lavas with more contaminated isotopic signatures that exhibit rubbly morphology at the surface.

Consequently, we carried out a palaeomagnetic investigation of Palaeogene red beds of the Dayao area of Yunnan Province in order to contribute to understanding the Palaeogene evolution of the SCB. A characteristic higher temperature magnetic component (HTC), with an unblocking temperature from 660\xb0C to 680\xb0C, was determined by principal component analysis (PCA), and positive fold tests indicated that the remanence was a primary magnetization.

These mainly silicic volcanic rocks and subordinate intermediate-basic volcanic rocks have long been considered to be Pliocene (Wuyu Group) or Eocene (Pana Formation) in age. However, our new zircon U\u2013Pb ages constrain the timing of eruption to the Early Cretaceous (124.6\xa0\xb1\xa01.6\u2013126.1\xa0\xb1\xa01.1\xa0Ma); thus, we have redefined these volcanic rocks as the Lower Cretaceous Zenong Group. The silicic volcanic rocks feature high-K calc-alkaline to shoshonitic compositions and are mostly strongly peraluminous, rich in Rb, Th, and light rare earth elements (LREEs), and depleted in Nb, Ta, P, and Ti. They are also characterized by negative whole-rock \u03b5Nd(t) values (\u20139.1 to \u201313.1) and variable 87Sr/86Sr ratios. Thus, the geochemical and zircon U\u2013Pb age data of the Jiwa volcanic rocks suggest that these rocks are associated with a continental arc and are mostly likely derived from anatexis of ancient continental crustal material and minor basalt-derived melts. The discovery of Early Cretaceous volcanic rocks in the southern central Lhasa Terrane extends the duration of magmatism triggered by southward subduction of the Bangong-Nujiang oceanic lithosphere from the Late Jurassic to the Early Cretaceous. The spatial distribution of magmatism is also extended 70\u201380\xa0km to the south. The Lower Cretaceous volcanic rocks in the Jiwa area are proposed to be a result of bi-directional subduction, with southward subduction of the Bangong-Nujiang oceanic crust and northward subduction of the Yarlung Zangbo oceanic crust. The bi-directional subduction of the oceanic lithosphere and gravitational sinking led to slab retreat at ca. 125\xa0Ma. The roll-back of the slab would have then led to back-arc extension and asthenospheric upwelling. The subduction-induced decompression melting of the mantle led to the generation of widespread rhyolitic volcanism with continental arc geochemical signatures.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Petrogenesis_and_tectonic_setting_of_Early_Cretaceous_magmatism_in_the_Jiwa_area_central_Lhasa_Terrane_Tibet/3171436', [u'Environmental Sciences', u'Chemical Sciences', u'Ecology', u'Cancer', u'Inorganic Chemistry'], []]

Spiller'], u'2016-02-23T08:29:36Z', u'Currently, it is not well understood how changes in biomaterial properties affect the foreign body response (FBR) or macrophage behavior. Because failed attempts at biomaterial degradation by macrophages have been linked to frustrated phagocytosis, a defining feature of the FBR, we hypothesized that increased hydrogel crosslinking density (and decreased degradability) would exacerbate the FBR. Gelatin hydrogels were crosslinked with glutaraldehyde (0.05, 0.1, and 0.3%) and implanted subcutaneously in C57BL/6 mice over the course of 3\xa0weeks. Interestingly, changes in hydrogel crosslinking did not affect the thickness of the fibrous capsule surrounding the hydrogels, expression of the pan-macrophage marker F480, expression of three macrophage phenotype markers (iNOS, Arg1, CD163), or expression of the myofibroblast marker aSMA, determined using semi-quantitative immunohistochemical analysis. With respect to temporal changes, the level of expression of the M1 marker (iNOS) remained relatively constant throughout the study, while the M2 markers Arg1 and CD163 increased over time. Expression of these M2 markers was highly correlated with fibrous capsule thickness. Differences in spatial distribution of staining also were noted, with the strongest staining for iNOS at the hydrogel surface and increasing expression of the myofibroblast marker aSMA toward the outer edge of the fibrous capsule. These results confirm previous reports that macrophages in the FBR exhibit characteristics of both M1 and M2 phenotypes. Understanding the effects (or lack of effects) of biomaterial properties on the FBR and macrophage phenotype may aid in the rational design of biomaterials to integrate with surrounding tissue.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Temporal_and_spatial_distribution_of_macrophage_phenotype_markers_in_the_foreign_body_response_to_glutaraldehyde_crosslinked_gelatin_hydrogels/2648671', [u'Medicine', u'Environmental Sciences', u'Chemical Sciences', u'Immunology', u'Biological Sciences', u'Science Policy'], []]

By varying the alkenyl groups on the dendrimers, the gelation time displayed a large range from 8 seconds to 18 hours, and the modulus of the hydrogels ranged from 36 to 183 Pa under experimental conditions. Investigation by 1H-NMR spectroscopy revealed that the gelation time and the stiffness of the hydrogels were governed by the degree of electron deficiency of alkenyl groups on the dendrimers. This research provided a systematic study on the relationship between chemical structures versus gelation time and mechanical properties of hydrogels, which could guide the way to synthesize in situ forming hydrogels with designated gelation time and stiffness for biomedical applications. Further, a RGD peptide was attached to the PAMAM dendrimers to enhance cell attachment and proliferation. Viability assays of Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC) in the synthesized hydrogels demonstrated the biocompatibility of the hydrogels after 48 hours of culturing, and the RGD peptide improved the viability of HUVEC cells in hydrogels.

[u'Gas-phase quasi-degeneracy of zwitterionic and canonical tautomers of glycine and proline induced by the presence of the MAlF<sub>4</sub> (M = Li, Na, K) salts', ['Dorota Wilenska', 'Piotr Skurski', 'Iwona Anusiewicz'], u'2016-01-19T21:42:22Z', u'The ionic MAlF4 salts (M = Li, Na, K) are postulated to act as effective stabilising agents with respect to glycine and proline zwitterionic tautomers. On the basis of ab-initio MP2/6-311++G(d,p) theoretical calculations, it is demonstrated that strong electrostatic interactions between the polar MAlF4 moiety and either Gly and Pro zwitterion should allow to suppress the intra-molecular proton transfer in the amino acid and thus render the zwitterion tautomer stable in the gas phase. Among the systems proposed, the K+AlF4\u2013 turned out to be the most efficient stabilising compound as its presence is expected to lead to the energetic quasi-degeneracy of the canonical and zwitterionic tautomers of glycine and proline.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Gas_phase_quasi_degeneracy_of_zwitterionic_and_canonical_tautomers_of_glycine_and_proline_induced_by_the_presence_of_the_MAlF_sub_4_sub_M_Li_Na_K_salts/2065473', [u'Biophysics', u'Biochemistry', u'Microbiology', u'Cell Biology', u'Genetics', u'Neuroscience', u'Chemical Sciences', u'Immunology', u'Mathematical Sciences', u'Inorganic Chemistry', u'Infectious Diseases', u'Plant Biology', u'Virology'], []]
