[u'Rhythmic modulation of visual contrast discrimination triggered by action', ['Alessandro Benedetto', 'Donatella Spinelli', 'Concetta Morrone'], u'2016-04-23T13:45:34Z', u'Recent evidence suggests that ongoing brain oscillations may be instrumental in binding and integrating multisensory signals. In the present experiment, we investigated the temporal dynamics of visual-motor integration processes. We show that action modulates sensitivity to visual contrast discrimination in a rhythmic fashion at frequencies of about 5Hz (in the theta range), for up to one second after execution of action. To understand the origin of the oscillations, we measured oscillations in contrast sensitivity at different levels of luminance, which is known to affect the endogenous brain rhythms, boosting the power of alpha-frequencies. We found that the frequency of oscillation in sensitivity increased at low-luminance, likely reflecting the shift in mean endogenous brain rhythm towards higher frequencies. Importantly, both at high and at low luminance, contrast discrimination showed a rhythmic motor-induced suppression effect, with the suppression occurring earlier at low luminance. We suggest that oscillations play a key role in sensory-motor integration, and that the motor-induced suppression may reflect the first manifestation of a rhythmic oscillation.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Rhythmic_modulation_of_visual_contrast_discrimination_triggered_by_action/3144508', [u'Behavioral Neuroscience'], []]

[u'Microstructure informed tractography: pitfalls and open challenges', ['Alessandro Daducci', 'Alessandro Dal Palu', 'Maxime Descoteaux', 'Jean-Philippe Thiran'], u'2016-05-23T12:02:38Z', u'One of the major limitations of diffusion MRI tractography is that the fiber tracts recovered by existing algorithms are not truly quantitative. Local techniques for estimating more quantitative features of the tissue microstructure exist, but their combination with tractography has always been considered intractable. Recent advances in local and global modeling made it possible to fill this gap and a number of promising techniques for microstructure informed tractography have been suggested, opening new and exciting perspectives for the quantification of brain connectivity. The ease-of-use of the proposed solutions made it very attractive for researchers to include such advanced methods in their analyses; however, this apparent simplicity should not hide some critical open questions raised by the complexity of these very high-dimensional problems, otherwise some fundamental issues may be pushed into the background. The aim of this article is to raise awareness in the diffusion MRI community, notably researchers working on brain connectivity, about some potential pitfalls and modeling choices that make the interpretation of the outcomes from these novel techniques rather cumbersome. Through a series of experiments on synthetic and real data, we illustrate practical situations where erroneous and severely biased conclusions may be drawn about the connectivity if these pitfalls are overlooked, like the presence of partial/missing/duplicate fibers or the critical importance of the diffusion model adopted. Microstructure informed tractography is a young but very promising technology, and by acknowledging its current limitations as done in this paper, we hope our observations will trigger further research in this direction and new ideas for truly quantitative and biologically meaningful analyses of the connectivity.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Microstructure_informed_tractography_pitfalls_and_open_challenges/3394990', [u'Neuroscience', u'Image Processing', u'Neurosciences', u'Applied Mathematics', u'Optimisation'], []]

[u'Omapatrilat', ['Amy Winfiled'], u'2016-05-30T07:22:23Z', u'Omapatrilat is an antihypertensive drug which acts by inhibiting angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase. ACE a zinc-containing carbopeptidase, catalyzes the conversion of the decapeptide angiotensin I (AI) to the octapeptide angiotensin II (AII). AII is a potent vasoconstrictor which also triggers the release of aldosterone, a sodium-retaining steroid. Thus ACE raises blood pressure by increasing both vascular resistance and \ufb02uid volume. Effective inhibitors of ACE have been used not only in the treatment of hypertension but in the clinical management of congestive heart failure. Neutral endopeptidase (NEP), like ACE, is a zinc metalloprotease and is found in high concentration in the brush border of the renal proximal tubule.

Here, we use RNA bisulfite sequencing (bsRNA-seq) for transcriptome-wide quantitative mapping of m5C in the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. We discover more than a thousand m5C sites in Arabidopsis mRNAs, long non-coding RNAs and other non-coding RNAs across three tissue types; siliques, seedling shoots and roots, and validate a number of these sites. Quantitative differences in methylated sites between these three tissues suggest tissue-specific regulation of m5C. Perturbing the RNA m5C methyltransferase TRM4B resulted in loss of m5C sites on mRNAs and non-coding RNAs and reduced the stability of tRNAAsp(GTC). We also demonstrate the importance of m5C in plant development as trm4b mutants have shorter primary roots due to reduced cell division in the root apical meristem. In addition, trm4b mutants show increased sensitivity to oxidative stress. Finally, we provide the first insights into the targeting mechanism of TRM4B by demonstrating that a 50 nt sequence flanking m5C C3349 in MAG5 mRNA is sufficient to confer methylation of a transgene reporter in Nicotiana benthamiana.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/David_et_al_2016_pdf/3408193', [u'Computational  Biology', u'Developmental Biology', u'Epigenetics (incl.

[u'MicroRNA binding motifs identification methods', ['Wenfa Ng'], u'2015-09-17T05:55:05Z', u'Identification of microRNA (miRNA) target recognition and binding motifs (miRNA response elements, MRE) is a major unsolved problem in non-coding RNA (ncRNA) research, given its myriad and important implications in post-transcriptional gene regulation and, by extension, physiological effects. While evolution is a central theme permeating biology, attempts at identifying a conserved canonical binding sequence between miRNA and mRNA targets reveal that a variety of non-canonical interactions likely dominate those dependent on a defined \u201cseed\u201d sequence in the 5\u2019 end of miRNA. Such non-canonical interactions include bulges, G:U wobbles and even seedless interactions, and could occur in the 5\u2019 untranslated region (UTR), 3\u2019 UTR, promoter and even coding DNA sequence (CDS). Experimental techniques for isolating miRNA-mRNA interactions, and determination of binding sequence, typically involves the formation of the Agonaute protein-dependent RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), followed by crosslinking, antibody-mediated pulldown, RNase and proteinase digestion, and finally, readout by next-generation short-read sequencing. Nevertheless, computational structural and energetics studies are critical for deducing the miRNA binding motif from sequenced reads. The slides presented here summarize several contemporary approaches for characterizing miRNA-target interactions, and elucidating binding motifs from the experimental and computational perspectives. Crosslinking and immunoprecipitation approaches include (High throughput sequencing of isolates from crosslinking and immunoprecipitation, HITS-CLIP), (Crosslinking and immunoprecipitation-sequencing, CLIP-Seq), (Photoactivable ribonucleoside enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation, PAR-CLIP), and (Crosslinking, ligation and sequencing of hybrids, CLASH), while computational algorithms featured are miRanda and TargetScan. Key features of each technique are provided, and the slides should be useful from the educational viewpoint, in introducing students to miRNA-mRNA heteroduplex isolation and binding sequence identification methods in either a molecular biology or life sciences techniques course.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/MicroRNA_binding_motifs_identification_methods/1373962', [u'Molecular Biology', u'Education'], []]

Numerous organic and aqueous/organic electrolytes of InCl3, NaCl, and elemental sulfur were investigated, including several glycols and amides. Temperatures ranged from 80-170\xb0C, and deposition voltages from -0.6 to -1.2 V (Ag/AgCl with organic filling solution). Substrates included indium tin oxide-on-glass, molybdenum, and titanium, with indium or graphite anodes. Rapid stirring was used. Deposition was sluggish in all baths. Uniformity and adherence were only moderate, with irregular coverage and cracking-and-flaking sometimes evident. The best baths were ethylene glycol or 1, 2-propanediol-based, with golden-yellow films, nominally In2S3-xOx, depositing typically heavier around the substrate edges. With low temperatures and/or large currents, brown films more rich in indium sometimes formed. Cyclic voltammetry elucidated onset potentials, secondary reactions, and photoactivity, with the greatest anodic photocurrents arising from In2S3's n-type conductivity occurring with mixed ethylene glycol/propionic acid/water baths.

Although having a bandgap of 2.0 eV relative to 2.5 eV for CdS, the lower toxicity and environmental impact of indium relative to cadmium, and significant photosensitivity, compel ongoing research [1]. Indium sulfide thin films were deposited onto molybdenum-coated glass (SiO2) substrates by electrodeposition from organic baths (ethylene glycol-based) containing indium chloride (InCl3), sodium chloride (NaCl), and sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O 3.5H2O), the latter used as an additional sulfur source along with elemental sulfur (S). The Taguchi method was used to optimize the deposition paramters so as to minimize non-uniformity, cracks, and improper stoichiometry. The measured performance characteristics (molar ratio (In:S) and crack density) for all of the In2S3 films were calculated to analyze the effect of each deposition factor (deposition voltage, deposition temperature, composition of solution, and deposition time) involved in the electrodeposition process by calculating the sensitivity (signal to noise, S/N, ratios).', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Statistical_Analysis_of_Electroplated_Indium_III_Sulfide_In_2_S_3_Films_a_Potential_Buffer_Material_for_PV_Heterojunction_Solar_Cells_Systems_using_Organic_Electrolytes/1394715', [u'Solar System, Solar Physics, Planets and Exoplanets', u'Electrochemistry', u'Optical Properties of Materials', u'Physical Chemistry of Materials', u'Synthesis of Materials', u'Metals and Alloy Materials', u'Materials Engineering', u'Engineering Instrumentation', u'Energy Generation, Conversion and Storage Engineering'], []]

In2S3 has emerged as a promising low-hazard buffer (or window) material, and has proven to improve the properties of the solar cells, while reducing toxicity. Various deposition techniques have been employed to synthesize In2S3 films on different types of substrates. Until now, atomic layer deposition (ALD) and ionic layer gas atomic reaction (ILGAR) techniques have been the two most successful, yielding maximum energy conversion efficiencies up to 16.4% and 16.1%, respectively. The impact of varied deposition parameters upon the In2S3 film properties and performance of cadmium (Cd)-free solar cells has been outlined.

Many of these analyses depend on the existence or creation of a reference genome, or a construction of sequence data into a representation of the target organism\u2019s genome. However, genome assembly tools cannot distinguish between the target organism and any contaminants that may have been sequenced at the same time. In addition, it is not feasible to isolate most target organisms from any parasites, symbionts, or other potential contaminants. Thus, new methods must be devised. Here, we use NGS data from an inbred line of C. remanei known as PX356 to compare three methods for filtering DNA sequence data for assembly.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Computational_Methods_for_Filtering_Contaminants_from_NGS_Data/3439580', [u'Bioinformatics'], []]

Recent interest in verifying 1D\u2009numerical schemes has led to the development of alternative experimental setups and the use of three-dimensional\u2009numerical models to acquire data not easily measured in vivo. In most studies to date, only one particular 1D\u2009scheme is tested. In this paper, we present a systematic comparison of six commonly used numerical schemes for 1D\u2009blood flow modelling: discontinuous Galerkin, locally conservative Galerkin, Galerkin least-squares finite element method, finite volume method, finite difference MacCormack method and a simplified trapezium rule method. Comparisons are made in a series of six benchmark test cases with an increasing degree of complexity. The accuracy of the numerical schemes is assessed by comparison with theoretical results, three-dimensional\u2009numerical data in compatible domains with distensible walls or experimental data in a network of silicone tubes. Results show a good agreement among all numerical schemes and their ability to capture the main features of pressure, flow and area waveforms in large arteries. All the information used in this study, including the input data for all benchmark cases, experimental data where available and numerical solutions for each scheme, is made publicly available online, providing a comprehensive reference data set to support the development of 1D\u2009models and numerical schemes.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/A_benchmark_study_of_numerical_schemes_for_one_dimensional_arterial_blood_flow_modelling/1586944', [u'Numerical Analysis', u'Biological Engineering'], []]
[u'Measures of Agreement Between Many Raters for Ordinal Classifications', ['Prof. Kerrie Nelson', 'Prof. Don Edwards'], u'2015-09-03T09:41:15Z', u'Screening and diagnostic procedures often require a physician\u2019s subjective interpretation of a patient\u2019s test result using an ordered categorical scale to define the patient\u2019s disease severity. Due to wide variability observed between physicians\u2019 ratings, many large-scale studies have been conducted to quantify agreement between multiple experts\u2019 ordinal classifications in common diagnostic procedures such as mammography. However, very few statistical approaches are available to assess agreement in these large-scale settings. Existing summary measures of agreement rely on extensions of Cohen\u2019s kappa [1 - 5]. These are prone to prevalence and marginal distribution issues, become increasingly complex for more than three experts or are not easily implemented. Here we propose a model-based approach to assess agreement in large-scale studies based upon a framework of ordinal generalized linear mixed models. A summary measure of agreement is proposed for multiple experts assessing the same sample of patients\u2019 test results according to an ordered categorical scale. This measure avoids some of the key flaws associated with Cohen\u2019s kappa and its extensions. Simulation studies are conducted to demonstrate the validity of the approach with comparison to commonly used agreement measures. The proposed methods are easily implemented using the software package R and are applied to two large-scale cancer agreement studies.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Measures_of_Agreement_Between_Many_Raters_for_Ordinal_Classifications/1514870', [u'Statistics', u'Medicine'], []]

Gibbons', 'Prof. Catherine M. Crespi', 'Prof. C.

These advantages include greater power to detect effects, increased sample heterogeneity, and the ability to perform more sophisticated analyses than meta-analyses that rely on published results. However, a fundamental challenge is that it is unlikely that variables of interest are measured the same way in all of the studies to be combined. We propose that this situation can be viewed as a missing data problem in which some outcomes are entirely missing within some trials, and use multiple imputation to fill in missing measurements. We apply our method to 5 longitudinal adolescent depression trials where 4 studies used one depression measure and the fifth study used a different depression measure. None of the 5 studies contained both depression measures. We describe a multiple imputation approach for filling in missing depression measures that makes use of external calibration studies in which both depression measures were used. We discuss some practical issues in developing the imputation model including taking into account treatment group and study. We present diagnostics for checking the fit of the imputation model and investigating whether external information is appropriately incorporated into the imputed values.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Multiple_imputation_for_harmonizing_longitudinal_non_commensurate_measures_in_individual_participant_data_meta_analysis/1466878', [u'Statistics', u'Medicine'], []]
[u'Data from: Reconstruction of full high-resolution HSQC using signal split in aliased spectra', ['Dr. Mohammadali Foroozandeh', 'Dr. Damien Jeannerat'], u'2016-07-14T19:16:55Z', u'Resolution enhancement is a long-sought goal in NMR spectroscopy. In conventional multidimensional NMR experiments, such as the 1H-13C HSQC, the resolution in the indirect dimensions is typically 10 to 100 times lower as in 1D spectra because it is limited by the experimental time. Reducing the spectral window can significantly increase the resolution, but at the cost of ambiguities in frequencies as a result of spectral aliasing. Fortunately, this information is not completely lost, and can be retrieved using methods in which chemical shifts are encoded in the aliased spectra and decoded after processing to reconstruct high-resolution 1H-13C HSQC spectrum with full spectral width and a resolution similar to that of 1D spectra. We applied a new reconstruction method called RHUMBA to spectra obtained using the DENA-HSQC and the new AMNA-HSQC experiments. The reconstructed spectra significantly facilitates both manual and automated spectral analysis and structure elucidation based on heteronuclear 2D experiments. The resolution is enhancement by two orders of magnitudes without the usual complications due to spectral aliasing.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Reconstruction_of_full_high_resolution_HSQC_using_signal_split_in_aliased_spectra/1575700', [u'Structural Biology', u'NMR Spectroscopy'], []]

In Trypanosoma brucei, SUMO is essential in procyclic and bloodstream forms. Furthermore, SUMO has been linked to the antigenic variation process, as a highly SUMOylated focus was recently identified within chromatin-associated proteins of the active VSG expression site. We aimed to establish a reliable strategy to identify SUMO conjugates in T. brucei. We expressed various tagged variants of SUMO from the endogenous locus. His-HA-TbSUMO was useful to validate the tag functionality but SUMO conjugates were not enriched enough over contaminants after affinity purification. A Lys-deficient SUMO version, created to reduce contaminants by Lys-C digestion, was able to overcome this issue but did not allow mapping many SUMOylation sites. This cell line was in turn useful to demonstrate that polySUMO chains are not essential for parasite viability. Finally, a His-HA-TbSUMOT106K version allowed the purification of SUMO conjugates and, after digestion with Lys-C, the enrichment for diGly-Lys peptides using specific antibodies. This site specific proteomic strategy led us to identify 45 SUMOylated proteins and 53 acceptor sites unambiguously. SUMOylated proteins belong mainly to nuclear processes such as DNA replication and repair, transcription, rRNA biogenesis, and chromatin remodelling, among others.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Different_proteomic_strategies_to_identify_genuine_SUMO_targets_and_their_modification_sites_in_Trypanosoma_brucei_procyclic_forms/1540859', [u'Cell Biology', u'Microbiology'], []]

Stephen Dumler M.D.'], u'2016-07-14T18:44:11Z', u'Control of host epigenetics is becoming evident as a mechanism by which symbionts and pathogens survive. Anaplasma phagocytophilum, an obligate intracellular bacterium, downregulates multiple host defense genes where histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) binds and histone 3 is deacetylated at their promoters, including the NADPH oxidase component, CYBB. How HDAC1 is targeted to defense gene promoters is unknown. Ankyrin A (AnkA), an A. phagocytophilum T4SS effector, enters the granulocyte nucleus, binds stretches of AT-rich DNA and alters transcription of antimicrobial defense genes, including downregulation of CYBB. Here we found AnkA binds to a predicted matrix attachment region in the proximal CYBB promoter. Using the CYBB promoter as a model of cis-gene silencing, we interrogated the mechanism of AnkA-mediated CYBB repression. The N-terminus of AnkA was critical for nuclear localization, the central ANK repeats and C-terminus were important for DNA binding, and most promoter activity localized to the central ANK repeats. Furthermore, a direct interaction between AnkA and HDAC1 was detected at the CYBB promoter, and was critical for AnkA-mediated CYBB repression. This novel microbial manipulation of host chromatin and gene expression provides important evidence of the direct effects that prokaryotic nuclear effectors can exert over host transcription and function.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Chromatin_bound_bacterial_effector_AnkA_recruits_HDAC1_and_modifies_host_gene_expression/1540853', [u'Cell Biology', u'Microbiology'], []]

The viral capsid is composed of tiny spikes with a diameter of ~5nm, connected to the membrane by a 6nm wide structure displaying thin striations, as assessed by several complementary EM imaging methods. Immature particles display an opening that closes after uptake of the viral genome and core proteins, followed by the formation of the mature virion. Together with our previous data this study shows a common principle of NCLDVs to build a single internal envelope from open membrane intermediates.

Animal models show that in the days after photochemotherapy and antigen provocation, cells with an antigen-specific suppressive phenotype are elicited in the lymphoid organs. In GvHD, host antigens are present not only in the skin treated by photochemotherapy but also in the visceral tissues.\xa0Objective:\xa0The aim of this paper was to evaluate the effect on visceral acute GvHD (aGvHD) of photochemotherapy of the skin.\xa0Methods:\xa0We retrospectively evaluated 33 patients with aGvHD of the skin, the liver, and/or the gastrointestinal tract treated with photochemotherapy for their aGvHD of the skin and did a long-term follow-up of 10 years on survival.\xa0Results:\xa0The complete response (CR) to photochemotherapy was 39%, the complete and partial response was 64% and the 6-month survival was 64%. Total body irradiation (TBI) before hematopoietic stem cell transplantation predisposed for CR of aGvHD of the liver and the gastrointestinal tract (p = 0.045). In the TBI group, the accumulated dose (numbers of treatments) for CR of visceral aGvHD increased with the body surface area affected by disease, from 8 (min-max: 5-14) for skin disease stage 1 to 10.5 (6-33) for stage 2 and 13 (11-21) for stage 3 (p = 0.04). Skin disease stage 1 showed a trend to be associated with CR in visceral disease at 28, 56, and 100 days (p = 0.07). Overall CR in visceral disease predicted a better 10-year overall survival (p = 0.0036). Finally, after TBI aGvHD of the gastrointestinal tract without anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), clearance of T cells and dendritic cells responded better than aGvHD of the liver and aGvHD of the gastrointestinal tract with ATG (p = 0.01).\xa0Conclusion:\xa0Photochemotherapy after ionizing irradiation regulates the cell-mediated immunity in the viscera, and the systemic efficacy increases when the skin itself is less affected by disease.

[u'Exploration is dependent on reproductive state, not social state', ['Hannah A Edwards', 'Hannah L Dugdale', 'David S Richardson', 'Jan Komdeur', 'Terry Burke'], u'2016-07-22T09:18:16Z', u'Personality\nis an intriguing phenomenon in populations because it constrains behavioural\nflexibility. One theory suggests that personality could be generated and\nmaintained if dependent on asset protection. It is predicted that trade\u2013offs\nwith fitness expectations and survival probability encourage consistent\nbehavioural differences among individuals (personality). Although not mutually\nexclusive, the social niche specialisation hypothesis suggests that a group of\nindividuals that repeatedly interact will develop personality to avoid costly\nsocial conflict. The point at which behavioural consistency originates in the\nsocial niche hypothesis is still unclear, with predictions for development\nafter a change in social status. In the facultative\ncooperatively breeding Seychelles warbler (Acrocephalus\nsechellensis), residing on Cousin Island, breeding vacancies are limited and\nthis forces individuals into different social roles. We used this system to\ntest whether reproductive and social state predicted among\u2013individual\ndifferences in exploration. We had two predictions. Firstly, that an individual\u2019s start in life can predict personality,\nwhereby young individuals with a good start to life (associated\nwith early age reproduction and earlier onset survival senescence) are fast\nexplorers, suggesting reproductive state\u2013dependence.\nSecondly, that an individual\u2019s social status can\npredict personality, whereby dominant\nindividuals will be fast explorers suggesting that the behaviour is social\nstate\u2013dependent. Neither of the\nbehaviours were associated with social state and social state did not affect behavioural\nconsistency. However, novel object exploration was associated with a proxy of reproductive\nstate. Our results provide further support for state being a mechanism for\ngenerating individual differences in behaviour.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Exploration_is_dependent_on_reproductive_state_not_social_state/3470747', [u'Behavioural Ecology'], []]

Methods: A cross sectional study of 114\npatients with schizophrenia attending HUSM psychiatric services from December\n2007 to May 2008 was conducted. The schizophrenia symptoms as well as verbal\nmemory performance were assessed using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, the\nMalay version of the Calgary Depression Scale (MVCDS), and the Malay version of\nthe Auditory Verbal Learning Test (MVAVLT). The relationship between verbal\nmemory performance and demographic/clinical symptoms was evaluated using\nPearson Correlation. Results: Overall MVAVLT scores in all the trials\nwere lowered in patients with schizophrenia compared to average healthy\ncontrols. There were significant relationships between occupational status and\nMVAVLT performance in Trial A1-A5 Total; between educational level and MVAVLT\nperformance in Trial A1 and Trial A1-A5 Total and between severities of\nillness; and MVAVLT performance in all indexes except Trial A1 after controlled\nfor occupation and educational level. Conclusions: Patient with\nschizophrenia in HUSM performed significantly worse than healthy controls in\nverbal memory with or without interference.

[u'The heritability of creative potential', ['Davide Piffer'], u'2016-07-25T16:06:39Z', u'Creativity is a multi-faceted, multi-factorial\nand polygenic trait. In other words, there are many domains of creativity\n(science, arts, mathematics, culinary, etc); many personality and cognitive\nfactors influence creativity (positively or negatively), and its variation\nbetween individuals is due to many genes. The aim of this study is to build a\nmodel of creative potential based on the evidence accumulated in the literature\nand to investigate the genetic and environmental influences on creative\npotential. Results confirm that creative achievement is the result of high\nintelligence, high openness to experience and novelty seeking, and divergent\nthinking. This study also finds support for the positive link between\npsychopathology and creativity, but it suggests that intelligence can mask this\nassociation, via a possible detrimental role on cognition of sub-clinical\nschizophrenia lying on a continuous spectrum going from mental health to\ninsanity. A verbal measure of divergent thinking was found to be highly heritable\n(67%), with no shared environmental contribution. However, lower heritabilities\nwere found for latent personality factors Openness/Novelty Seeking (0-28%) and\nImpulsivity (26%), but higher for\xa0\nSchizophrenia (52.6%) with no significant shared environmental\ncontribution.

[u'Automation of Antimicrobial Activity Screening', ['Samuel P Forry'], u'2016-03-08T18:00:37Z', u'Manual and automated methods were compared for routine screening of compounds for antimicrobial activity. Automation generally accelerated assays and required less user intervention while producing comparable results. Automated protocols were validated for planktonic, biofilm, and agar cultures of the oral microbe Streptococcus mutans that is commonly associated with tooth decay. Toxicity assays for the known antimicrobial compound cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) were validated against planktonic, biofilm forming, and 24 h biofilm culture conditions, and several commonly reported toxicity/antimicrobial activity measures were evaluated: the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50), the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). Using automated methods, three halide salts of cetylpyridinium (CPC, CPB, CPI) were rapidly screened with no detectable effect of the counter ion on antimicrobial activity.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Automation_of_Antimicrobial_Activity_Screening/1453182', [u'Microbiology', u'Biotechnology', u'Toxicology', u'Biological Techniques'], []]
[u'A genome-scale investigation of how sequence-, function-, and tree-based gene properties influence phylogenetic inference', ['Xing-Xing Shen'], u'2016-07-26T14:10:36Z', u'Molecular phylogenetic inference is inherently dependent on choices in both methodology and data. Many insightful studies have shown how choices in methodology, such as the model of sequence evolution or optimality criterion used, can strongly influence inference. In contrast, much less is known about the impact of choices in the properties of the data, typically genes, on phylogenetic inference. We investigated the relationships between 52 gene properties (24 sequence-based, 19 function-based, and 9 tree-based) with each other and with three measures of phylogenetic signal in two assembled data sets of 2,832 yeast and 2,002 mammalian genes. We found that most gene properties, such as evolutionary rate (measured through the percent average of pairwise identity across taxa) and total tree length, were highly correlated with each other. Similarly, several gene properties, such as gene alignment length, GC content, and the proportion of tree distance on internal branches divided by relative composition variability (treeness/RCV), were strongly correlated with phylogenetic signal. Analysis of partial correlations between gene properties and phylogenetic signal in which gene evolutionary rate and alignment length were simultaneously controlled, showed similar patterns of correlations, albeit weaker in strength. Examination of the relative importance of each gene property on phylogenetic signal identified gene alignment length, alongside with number of parsimony-informative sites and variable sites, as the most important predictors. Interestingly, the subsets of gene properties that optimally predicted phylogenetic signal differed considerably across our three phylogenetic measures and two data sets; however, gene alignment length and RCV were consistently included as predictors of all three phylogenetic measures in both yeasts and mammals. These results suggest that a handful of sequence-based gene properties are reliable predictors of phylogenetic signal and could be useful in guiding the choice of phylogenetic markers.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/A_genome-scale_investigation_of_how_sequence-_function-_and_tree-based_gene_properties_influence_phylogenetic_inference/1597710', [u'Evolutionary Biology'], []]
