[u'Three-Dimensional Histology', ['Wutian  Wu'], u'2016-08-12T05:00:07Z', u'The study of neural tissue architecture and\ncellular morphology is important in neuroscientific research. Visualizing and understanding the three-dimensional\n(3D) spatial relationships of cells or molecules has been difficult in\nconventional histology. Serial sections of tissues are often required, which is time- and labour-intensive, leads to physical damage and depletion of tissue samples. The advances in optical microscopy and fluorescent\nprobes have led to the emergence of tissue clearing\nmethods, allowing\nintact, transparent tissues to be optically sectioned, imaged, and\nreconstructed in 3D in\nsilico. Here, we briefly introduce the techniques that facilitate rigorous\n3D histological evaluation of intact transparent tissues and better\nvisualization of neuronal tracts and fibers, which would allow researchers to\ngain extraordinary insights into the processes of neurodegeneration and\nneuroregeneration.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Three-Dimensional_Histology/3573861', [u'Neuroscience'], []]

[u'Demographic Inference Using Skyline Plots on Approximate Bayesian Computation', ['Miguel Navascues', 'Concetta Burgarella'], u'2016-08-11T14:55:53Z', u'Bayesian Skyline Plots (BSPs) are\nrepresentations of the posterior probability density of the effective\npopulation size in function of time; i.e. a graphical representation\nof the fluctuation of the effective population size with time based\non the estimates obtained from Bayesian inference. The interest of\nBSPs is that they allow to infer gradual changes of the effective\npopulation size without an a priori assumption on a mathematical\nfunction determining the shape of the demographic change. For\ninstance, population expanding, instantaneously, exponentially or\nlogistically can be well characterized by a BSP. Currently, the only\nimplementation of this analysis has been done within the MCMC-based\nestimation of likelihood approach and is restricted to\nnon-recombining DNA sequence data. We have explored how to implement\nBSP within the approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) framework, with\npromising preliminary results. An implementation in ABC allows to\nobtain BSP from multilocus data, recombining DNA sequence data but\nalso other molecular markers such as microsatellites, AFLPs or SNPs\n(actually, any type of data that can be simulated).', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Demographic_Inference_Using_Skyline_Plots_on_Approximate_Bayesian_Computation/3571158', [u'Population, Ecological and Evolutionary Genetics', u'Biostatistics'], []]
