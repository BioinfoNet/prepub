Nevertheless, the current knowledge about their biology (e.g. heredity, biogenesis) and function is largely incomplete, and mostly biased toward a few taxonomic groups. Focusing the research on a small and homogeneous subset of organisms entails the risk of losing a big part of the molecular and functional diversity of mitochondria.", u'https://figshare.com/articles/The_Doubly_Uniparental_Inheritance_of_Mitochondria_a_useful_model_for_mitochondrial_biology_and_evolution_/3470264', [u'Evolutionary Biology', u'Invertebrate Biology', u'Zoology'], []]
