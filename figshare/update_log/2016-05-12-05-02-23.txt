Methods:\n RTX was administered to 31 patients with MC (type II in 29 cases and \ntype III in 2) with diffuse membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (16\n cases), peripheral neuropathy (26) and large skin ulcers (7). All but 4\n patients had serum anti-hepatitis C virus antibodies. RTX was \nadministered at a dose of 375 mg/m2, according to a \u20184 + 2' \nprotocol (days 1, 8, 15 and 22 plus 1 dose 1 and 2 months later). No \nother immunosuppressive drugs were added. Response was evaluated over a \nvery long-term follow-up (mean 72.47 months, range 30-148). Results:\n Complete remission of pretreatment active manifestations was observed \nin all cases of purpuric lesions and non-healing vasculitic ulcers, and \nin 80% of the peripheral neuropathies. Cryoglobulinemic nephropathy \nsignificantly improved during follow-up, starting from the 2nd month \nafter RTX (serum creatinine from 2.1 \xb1 1.7 to 1.5 \xb1 1.6 mg/dl, p \u2264 0.05;\n 24-hour proteinuria from 2.3 \xb1 2.1 to 0.9 \xb1 1.9 g/24 h, p \u2264 0.05). \nImprovement of cryoglobulinemic serological hallmarks, such as cryocrit \nand low complement C4, were observed. No clinically relevant side \neffects were recorded. Re-induction with RTX was carried out in 9 \nrelapsed patients after a mean of 31.1 months (12-54), again with \nbeneficial effects. The survival rate was 75% at 6 years and the \nprobability of remaining symptom-free for 10 years without any therapy \nwas of about 60% after a single \u20184 + 2' infusion cycle, while the \nprobability of living symptom-free 5 years after relapsing was 80% if \ngiven the same treatment. Conclusion: In this open, prospective study, RTX appeared to be very effective and safe in the treatment of the most severe cases of MC.", u'https://figshare.com/articles/Supplementary_Material_for_Improved_4_Plus_2_Rituximab_Protocol_for_Severe_Cases_of_Mixed_Cryoglobulinemia_A_6-Year_Observational_Study/3213319', [u'Medicine'], []]
[u'The Effect of the Amount and Timing of Folic Acid Supplementation During the Life Course on the Epigenetic Regulation of Cancer Determining Genes', ['Mark A Burton', 'Karen Lillycrop', 'Leonie Grenfell', 'Graham Burdge'], u'2016-05-11T10:37:17Z', u'Mandatory Folic Acid (FA) fortification of staple foodsin a number of countries and periconceptional supplementation has led to increased levels of FA intake. There is ongoing controversy over the effect of FA supplementation on cancer risk, with high levels of FA (\u2265400ug/day) associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. FA is thought to infer cancer risk through modulation of the epigenome. Here, we investigated whether variations in FA intakeduring adulthood induced persistent changes in theexpression of the tumour suppressor gene Brca1 andthe pluripotency gene Oct-4, which play key roles inDNA repair and cellular differentiation.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/The_Effect_of_the_Amount_and_Timing_of_Folic_Acid_Supplementation_During_the_Life_Course_on_the_Epigenetic_Regulation_of_Cancer_Determining_Genes/1081813', [u'Systems Biology', u'Molecular Biology', u'Cancer', u'Genetics', u'Developmental Biology'], []]

[u'A two-neuron system for adaptive goal-directed decision-making in Lymnaea', ['Michael Crossley', 'Kevin Staras', 'Gyorgy Kemenes'], u'2016-05-11T09:09:03Z', u'During goal-directed decision-making, animals\nmust integrate information from the external environment and their internal\nstate to maximize resource localization while minimizing energy expenditure.\nHow this complex problem is solved by the nervous system, remains poorly\nunderstood. Here, using a combined behavioral and neurophysiological approach,\nwe demonstrate that the mollusk Lymnaea performs a sophisticated form of\ndecision-making during food-searching behavior using a core system comprised of\njust two neuron types. The first, a command-like cell, reports the presence of\nfood and the second, a multifunctional interneuron, encodes motivational state,\nacting as a gain controller for adaptive behavior in the absence of food. Using\nan in vitro analog of the decision-making process, we show that the system\nemploys an energy-management strategy, switching between a low and a high-use mode\ndepending on the outcome of the decision. Our study reveals a parsimonious\nmechanism that drives a complex adaptive decision-making process.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/A_two-neuron_system_for_adaptive_goal-directed_decision-making_in_Lymnaea/3249310', [u'Neuroscience'], []]
