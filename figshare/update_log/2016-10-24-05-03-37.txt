Effect of Campomanesia adamantium peel\nextract on cGMP levels in T84 cells. Cells were pretreated with extract (0.25, 0.5, 1,\n2.5, 5 and 10 mg/mL) or vehicle (DPBS) for 10 min and then treated with 1 \xb5M of\nSTa for 10 min. STa was added in groups of C.\nadamantium (all concentrations), Tadalafil e FPIPP. TAD (tadalafil) and\nFPIPP (antidiarrheal drug) was used as control drugs that increase and decrease\ncGMP levels, respectively. Results are presented as mean + SEM. n=4-6; One-way\nANOVA followed by Tukey\xb4s test; #P <0.05 compared to baseline group; *P\n<0.05 compared to STa group.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Figure1/3731970', [u'Pharmacology'], []]
