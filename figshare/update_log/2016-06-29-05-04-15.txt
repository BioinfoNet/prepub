[u'Lousy lessons learned: Data cloning and parameter estimability', ['Stephanie Peacock'], u'2016-06-29T04:08:25Z', u'The statistical tools available to ecologists are\nbecoming increasingly sophisticated, allowing more complex, mechanistic models\nto be fit to ecological data. Such models have the potential to provide new\ninsights into the processes underlying ecological patterns, but the inferences\nmade are limited by the information in the data. Statistical non-estimability of\nmodel parameters due to insufficient information in the data is a problem\ntoo-often ignored by ecologists employing complex models. Here, we show how a\nnew statistical computing method called data cloning can be used in simulation\nstudies to assess the estimability of model parameters and inform study design\nbefore data are collected. A case study of parasite transmission from farmed to\nwild salmon highlights that assessing the estimability of ecologically relevant\nparameters should be a key step when designing studies in which fitting complex\nmechanistic models is the end goal.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Lousy_lessons_learned_Data_cloning_and_parameter_estimability/3466544', [u'Computational Biology', u'Host-Parasite Interactions', u'Marine Biology'], []]
[u'TreeFam and Ensembl: Phylogenetic resources', ['Mateus Patricio'], u'2016-06-28T19:41:53Z', u'The Ensembl and Ensembl Genomes projects create and distribute genome annotations for a wide range of genomes, including model organisms. The number of publicly available genomes is increasingly rapidly, providing an opportunity for new insights via comparative genomics. TreeFam produces phylogenetic trees and orthology predictions, though previously only for metazoans. Here we describe advances in TreeFam, targeted to achieve scalability to all Ensembl eukaryotes.The key component is a new library of HMM (Hidden Markov Model) profiles (Figure 2) that was created from Panther and TreeFam, with custom profiles to fill gaps in gene coverage. The library represents gene families across all eukaryotes.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/TreeFam_and_Ensembl_Phylogenetic_resources/3466259', [u'Bioinformatics'], []]
[u'Immunochemiluminiscence Assay.jpg', ['Yudong Lu'], u'2016-06-28T06:37:17Z', u'Chemiluminescence (CL) is defined as the emission of electromagnetic radiation caused by a chemical reaction to produce light. Chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) is an assay that combine chemiluminescence technique with immunochemical reactions. Similar with other labeled immunoassays (RIA, FIA, ELISA), CLIA utilize chemical probes which could generate light emission through chemical reaction to label the antibody. In recent years, CLIA has gained increasing attention in different fields, including life science, clinical diagnosis, environmental monitoring, food safety and pharmaceutical analysis because of its high sensitivity, good specificity, wide range of applications, simple equipment and wide linear range.\xa0CLIA have three different label systems according to the difference of physical chemistry mechanism of the light emission', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Immunochemiluminiscence_Assay_jpg/3465221', [u'Biological Techniques', u'Biotechnology', u'Immunology'], []]
[u'Supplementary Material for: Nutritional Status Deteriorates Postoperatively Despite Preoperative Nutritional Support', ['Grass F.', 'Benoit M.', 'Coti Bertrand P.', 'Sola J.', 'Schafer M.', 'Demartines N.', 'Hubner M.'], u'2016-06-28T06:36:29Z', u'Background/Aims:\xa0The aim of the current study was to assess the postoperative evolution of nutritional status and to relate it with postoperative outcomes.Methods:\xa0Demographic, surgical and nutritional parameters were assessed 10 days preoperatively (d-10) and 30 days postoperatively (d30) in 146 patients. Risk factors responsible for perioperative (>5% between d-10 and d30) weight loss were identified. Overall, severe (Clavien 3-5) and infectious complications were compared in patients with and without perioperative weight loss (>5%).\xa0Results:\xa0Nutritional status worsened beyond the postoperative period as reflected by decreasing weight (67 \xb1 13 kg at d-10 vs. 63 \xb1 13 kg at d30, p < 0.001), body mass index (23.4 \xb1 4 vs. 22.2 \xb1 4 kg/m2, p < 0.001) and mid upper-arm muscle circumference (MAMC, 241 \xb1 32 vs. 232 \xb1 30 mm, p < 0.001). Fifty-two patients (46%) lost >5% of their body weight between d-10 and d30. Patients who presented overall (63 vs. 36%, p = 0.004) and major (27 vs. 10%, p = 0.016) postoperative complications were at significantly higher risk to deteriorate postoperative nutritional status. Multivariate analysis identified low preoperative lean body mass (OR 3.2; 95% CI 1.2-8.9, p = 0.023) and low preoperative MAMC (OR 2.5; 95% CI 0.9-6.8, p = 0.066) as independent risk factors for perioperative weight loss.\xa0Conclusions:\xa0These data suggest continuing nutritional follow-up after the index hospitalization.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Supplementary_Material_for_Nutritional_Status_Deteriorates_Postoperatively_Despite_Preoperative_Nutritional_Support/3465218', [u'Medicine'], []]
[u'Antigen and antibody.jpg', ['Yudong Lu'], u'2016-06-28T06:32:38Z', u'Immunoassay is a biochemical method that identifies and quantifies unknown analytes (protein, lipid, nucleic acid etc.) in solution (serum, urine etc.) using antibody-antigen reactions. There are many different formats and variations of an immunoassay, but the key point is still specific antibody-antigen recognition. What is an antigen and an antibody?
