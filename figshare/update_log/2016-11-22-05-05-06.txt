Analyses of the molecular profile of IGCNU and seminoma show similarities to the expression profile of fetal germ cells/gonocytes. In murine PGCs, expression and interaction of Blimp1 and Prmt5 results in arginine 3 dimethylation of histone H2A and H4.

[u'Transcription Factor TFAP2C Regulates Major Programs Required for Murine Fetal Germ Cell Maintenance and Haploinsufficiency Predisposes to Teratomas in Male Mice', ['Marcos Arauzo-Bravo', 'Natalie Hass', 'Sabine Schafer', 'Susanne Weber', 'Astrid Becker', 'Dawid Eckert', 'Andreas Zimmer', 'Daniel Nettersheim', 'Hubert Schorle'], u'2016-11-21T10:27:40Z', u'Maintenance and maturation of primordial germ cells is controlled by complex genetic and epigenetic cascades, and disturbances in this network lead to either infertility or malignant aberration. Transcription factor TFAP2C has been described to be essential for primordial germ cell maintenance and to be upregulated in several human germ cell cancers. Using global gene expression profiling, we identified genes deregulated upon loss of Tfap2c in embryonic stem cells and primordial germ cell-like cells. We show that loss of Tfap2c affects many aspects of the genetic network regulating germ cell biology, such as downregulation of maturation markers and induction of markers indicative for somatic differentiation, cell cycle, epigenetic remodeling and pluripotency. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated binding of TFAP2C to regulatory regions of deregulated genes (Sfrp1, Dmrt1, Nanos3, c-Kit, Cdk6, Cdkn1a, Fgf4, Klf4, Dnmt3b and Dnmt3l) suggesting that these genes are direct transcriptional targets of TFAP2C in primordial germ cells. Since Tfap2c deficient primordial germ cell-like cells display cancer related deregulations in epigenetic remodeling, cell cycle and pluripotency control, the Tfap2c-knockout allele was bred onto 129S2/Sv genetic background. There, mice heterozygous for Tfap2c develop with high incidence germ cell cancer resembling human pediatric germ cell tumors. Precursor lesions can be observed as early as E16.5 in \xa0developing testes displaying persisting expression of pluripotency markers. We further demonstrate that mice with a heterozygous deletion of the TFAP2C target gene Nanos3 are also prone to develop teratomas. These data highlight TFAP2C as a critical and dose-sensitive regulator of germ cell fate.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Transcription_Factor_TFAP2C_Regulates_Major_Programs_Required_for_Murine_Fetal_Germ_Cell_Maintenance_and_Haploinsufficiency_Predisposes_to_Teratomas_in_Male_Mice/4244528', [u'Animal Cell and Molecular Biology', u'Animal Developmental and Reproductive Biology', u'Cancer', u'Cell Biology', u'Developmental Biology', u'Developmental Genetics (incl.

The transcriptional regulator Prdm1 has been identified as a main coordinator of this process, controlling epigenetic modification and gene expression. Here we report on the expression pattern of the transcription factor Tcfap2c, a putative downstream target of Prdm1, during normal mouse embryogenesis and the consequences of its specific loss in primordial germ cells (PGCs) and their derivatives. Tcfap2c is expressed in PGCs from Embryonic Day 7.25 (E 7.25) up to E 12.5, and targeted disruption resulted in sterile animals, both male and female. In the mutant animals, PGCs were specified but were lost around E8.0. PGCs generated in vitro from embryonic stem cells lacking TCFAP2C displayed induction of Prdm1 and Dppa3. Upregulation of Hoxa1, Hoxb1, and T together with lack of expression of germ cell markers such Nanos3, Dazl, and Mutyh suggested that the somatic gene program is induced in TCFAP2C-deficient PGCs. Repression of TCFAP2C in TCam-2, a human PGCresembling seminoma cell line, resulted in specific upregulation of HOXA1, HOXB1, MYOD1, and HAND1, indicative of mesodermal differentiation. Expression of genes indicative of ectodermal, endodermal, or extraembryonic differentiation, as well as the finding of no change to epigenetic modifications, suggested control by other factors. Our results implicate Tcfap2c\xa0as an important effector of Prdm1 activity that is required for PGC maintenance, most likely mediating Prdm1-induced suppression of mesodermal differentiation.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Critical_Function_of_AP-2gamma_TCFAP2C_in_Mouse_Embryonic_Germ_Cell_Maintenance/4244543', [u'Animal Cell and Molecular Biology', u'Animal Developmental and Reproductive Biology', u'Cancer', u'Cell Biology', u'Cell Development, Proliferation and Death', u'Developmental Biology', u'Gene Expression (incl.

This leads to hypercondensation of chromatin and ensures physiological sperm morphology, thereby protecting DNA integrity. In mice and humans, two protamines, protamine-1 (Prm1) and protamine-2 (Prm2) are expressed in a species-specific ratio. In humans, alterations of this PRM1/PRM2 ratio is associated with subfertility. By applying CRISPR/Cas9 mediated gene-editing in oocytes, we established Prm2-deficient mice. Surprisingly, heterozygous males remained fertile with sperm displaying normal head morphology and motility. In Prm2-deficient sperm, however, DNA-hypercondensation and acrosome formation was severely impaired. Further, the sperm displayed severe membrane defects resulting in immotility. Thus, lack of Prm2 leads not only to impaired histone to protamine exchange and disturbed DNA-hypercondensation, but also to severe membrane defects resulting in immotility. Interestingly, previous attempts using a regular gene-targeting approach failed to establish Prm2-deficient mice. This was due to the fact that already chimeric animals generated with Prm2+/\u2212 ES cells were sterile. However, the Prm2-deficient mouse lines established here clearly demonstrate that mice tolerate loss of one Prm2 allele. As such they present an ideal model for further studies on protamine function and chromatin organization in murine sperm.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Re-visting_the_Protamine-2_locus_deletion_but_not_haploinsufficiency_renders_mal_mice_infertile/4244510', [u'Animal Developmental and Reproductive Biology', u'Animal Cell and Molecular Biology', u'Animal Structure and Function', u'Developmental Biology', u'Evolutionary Biology', u'Genetics', u'Genome Structure and Regulation', u'Medicine', u'Molecular Biology', u'Structural Biology'], []]

But such search and analysis of disparate data presupposes a consistent semantic representation of the metadata that annotate the research data. Semantic grouping of data is the cornerstone of efficient searches and meta-analyses. Existing metadata are either granularly defined as tag\u2013value pairs (e.g., sample organism="homo sapiens") or implicitly found in long textual descriptions (e.g., in a study design overview). Current practice is to manually map metadata strings to ontological terms before any data analysis can begin. But manual semantic annotation is time-consuming and requires domain and ontology expertise, and therefore may not scale with metadata growth.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/SAP_a_CEDAR-based_pipeline_for_semantic_annotation_of_biomedical_metadata/4244465', [u'Bioinformatics'], []]

Knowledge about experimental \nmethods can be incorporated as metadata in online data sets and used to \nguide the work of future investigators. The technology being developed \nby the Center for Expanded Data Annotation and Retrieval (CEDAR), which \nis designed to ease the annotation of online data sets, will use such \nrepresentations of experimental methods to improve communication among \nresearchers and to automate experimental workflows that replicate \nprevious investigations. We have identified three distinct levels of \nabstraction used to represent experimental methods: (1) the level of the\n "abstract" (how the method would be presented in a paper\'s abstract), \n(2) the level of the "methods section," and (3) the level of the \n"notebook" (or that of supplementary information). Even at the level of \n"supplementary information," important details needed to carry out the \nexperiment are often left out because they are assumed to be obvious. \nThis problem is only exacerbated at the less-specific levels. With a \nrigorous model of this experiment, all steps, no matter how \n"well-known," will be expressed. Having all details available, if \nneeded, will allow for better understanding of the method and for better\n understanding of the resultant data. Our work will result in the \nidentification of motifs and steps in protocols as they are written at \nall three levels. The representation scientific methods in this manner \nwill provide a detailed, multi-scale model of scientific procedures that\n can stand in for the methods section of a publication when searching \nfor or comparing data sets online.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Augmenting_Metadata_with_Models_of_Experimental_Methods/4244420', [u'Bioinformatics', u'Cheminformatics', u'Bioinformatics Software'], []]
