[u'PowerPoint Slides for: A Double-Blind, Placebo Controlled, Randomized Phase 1 Cross-Over Study with ALLN-177, an Orally Administered Oxalate Degrading Enzyme', ['Langman C.B.', 'Grujic D.', 'Pease R.M.', 'Easter L.', 'Nezzer J.', 'Margolin A.', 'Brettman L.'], u'2016-09-05T13:41:06Z', u'Background: Hyperoxaluria may result from increased endogenous production or overabsorption of dietary oxalate in the gastrointestinal tract leading to nephrolithiasis and, in some, to oxalate nephropathy and chronic kidney disease. ALLN-177 is an oral formulation of a recombinant, oxalate specific, microbial enzyme oxalate decarboxylase intended to treat secondary hyperoxaluria by degrading dietary oxalate in the gastrointestinal tract, thereby reducing its absorption and subsequent excretion in the urine. Methods: This double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized, cross-over, phase 1 study of ALLN-177 evaluated the tolerability of ALLN-177 and its effect on urinary oxalate excretion in 30 healthy volunteers with hyperoxaluria induced by ingestion of a high oxalate, low calcium (HOLC) diet. The primary end point was the difference in the mean 24-hour urinary oxalate excretion during the ALLN-177 treatment period compared with the placebo treatment period. Results: The daily urinary oxalate excretion increased in the study population from 27.2 \xb1 9.5 mg/day during screening to 80.8 \xb1 24.1 mg/day (mean \xb1 SD) on the HOLC diet before introducing ALLN-177 or placebo therapy for 7 days. Compared to placebo, ALLN-177 treatment reduced urinary oxalate by 11.6 \xb1 2.7 mg/day, p = 0.0002 (least squares mean \xb1 SD). Conclusions: In healthy volunteers, with diet-induced hyperoxaluria treatment with ALLN-177, when compared to placebo, significantly reduced urinary oxalate excretion by degrading dietary oxalate in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby reducing its absorption. ALLN-177 may represent a new approach for managing secondary hyperoxaluria and its complications.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/PowerPoint_Slides_for_A_Double-Blind_Placebo_Controlled_Randomized_Phase_1_Cross-Over_Study_with_ALLN-177_an_Orally_Administered_Oxalate_Degrading_Enzyme/3635727', [u'Medicine'], []]
[u'Experiment series in environmental engineering: Experiment 5 (NUS ChBE, AY 2004/2005, Semester 1)', ['Wenfa Ng'], u'2016-09-05T08:41:50Z', u'This\nexperiment is designed to illustrate the major parts of the industrial ion\nexchange service cycle and to introduce the EDTA-Hardness titration method to\ndetermine hardness. The objective of the experiment is to determine the\nexchange capacity of the cationic exchange resin used. The theoretical exchange\ncapacity of the resin is\xa0 74176.08 mg as CaCO3 / l resin\xa0 which concurs with that reported in the\nliterature for polystyrene-divinylbenzene resin. The regeneration efficiency is\ndetermined to be\xa0 53.6%\xa0 which also agrees with that in the\nliterature. In conclusion, the objective of the experiment is successfully\naccomplished.
