[u'Processing of single-photon responses in the mammalian On and Off retinal pathways at the sensitivity limit of vision', ['Daisuke Takeshita', 'Lina Smeds', 'Petri Ala-Laurila'], u'2016-11-15T14:02:40Z', u'Visually guided behaviour at its\nsensitivity limit relies on single-photon responses originating in a small number\nof rod photoreceptors. For decades, researchers have debated the neural mechanisms and noise sources that underlie this striking sensitivity. To address this question, we need to understand\nthe constraints arising from the retinal output signals provided by distinct\nretinal ganglion cell types. It has recently been shown in the primate retina\nthat On and Off parasol ganglion cells, the cell types likely to underlie light\ndetection at the absolute visual threshold, differ fundamentally not only in\nresponse polarity, but also in the way they handle single-photon responses\noriginating in rods. The On pathway provides the brain with a thresholded,\nlow-noise readout, and the Off pathway with a noisy, linear readout. We outline\nthe mechanistic basis of these different coding strategies and analyse their\nimplications for detecting the weakest light signals. We show that\nhigh-fidelity, nonlinear signal processing in the On pathway comes with costs:\nmore single-photon responses are lost and their propagation is delayed compared\nto the Off pathway. On the other hand, the responses of On ganglion cells allow\nbetter intensity discrimination compared to the Off ganglion cell responses\nnear visual threshold.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Data_set/4232717', [u'Neuroscience'], []]
