[u'Herbs, ingredients and targets of SWT and SJZT1.rar', ['zhijun xie', 'Jing Sun', 'Li Zhang', 'Yujun HE', 'Kun Zhang', 'Liping Wu', 'Yongsheng Fan'], u'2016-06-16T02:17:00Z', u'Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is\nincreasingly getting clinical application worldwide. But its theory like\nQI-Blood is still abstract. Actually, Qi deficiency and blood deficiency, which\nwere treated by Si-Jun-Zi-Tang (SJZT) and Si-Wu-Tang (SWT) respectively, have characteristic\nclinical manifestations. Here, we analyzed targets of the ingredients in SJZT\nand SWT to unveil potential biologic mechanisms between Qi deficiency and blood\ndeficiency through biomedical approaches. First, ingredients in SWT and SJZT\nwere retrieved from TCMID database. The genes targeted by these ingredients\nwere chosen from STITCH. After enrichment analysis by Gene Ontology (GO) and DAVID,\nenriched GO terms with p-value less than 0.01 were collected and interpreted\nthrough DAVID and KEGG. Then a visualized network was constructed with ClueGO. Finally,\na total of 243 genes targeted by 195 ingredients of SWT formula and 209 genes\ntargeted by 61 ingredients of SJZT were obtained.

A general time reversible model with gamma distributed rate variation\nand a proportion of invariable sites was used, with parameters estimated from\nthe data during the analysis.\xa0 A\nsite-specific rate model was used, that allowed each codon position to have its\nown rate. Models were run for 1 million MCMC generations, with trees being\nsampled every 1000 generations. The first 25 per cent of the trees were\ndiscarded to ensure that the chains had reached stationarity, and a consensus\ntree was created from the remaining trees.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Phylogenies_of_CCapSV_DImmSV_and_PAegRV/3437723', [u'Evolutionary Biology'], []]
[u'Elemental sulfur-based electrodeposition of indium sulfide films', ['Maqsood ali Mughal'], u'2015-04-27T02:14:02Z', u"We report research on electrodeposition of indium sulfide films, with In2S3 a less hazardous alternative to CdS buffer layers in solar cells. Numerous organic and aqueous/organic electrolytes of InCl3, NaCl, and elemental sulfur were investigated, including several glycols and amides. Temperatures ranged from 80-170\xb0C, and deposition voltages from -0.6 to -1.2 V (Ag/AgCl with organic filling solution). Substrates included indium tin oxide-on-glass, molybdenum, and titanium, with indium or graphite anodes. Rapid stirring was used. Deposition was sluggish in all baths. Uniformity and adherence were only moderate, with irregular coverage and cracking-and-flaking sometimes evident. The best baths were ethylene glycol or 1, 2-propanediol-based, with golden-yellow films, nominally In2S3-xOx, depositing typically heavier around the substrate edges. With low temperatures and/or large currents, brown films more rich in indium sometimes formed. Cyclic voltammetry elucidated onset potentials, secondary reactions, and photoactivity, with the greatest anodic photocurrents arising from In2S3's n-type conductivity occurring with mixed ethylene glycol/propionic acid/water baths. Scanning electron microscope photographs indicated a compact small grain microstructure for yellow films. Energy dispersive X-ray analysis and photoelectron spectroscopy data indicate up to 15% oxygen content.", u'https://figshare.com/articles/Elemental_sulfur_based_electrodeposition_of_indium_sulfide_films/1394708', [u'Solar System, Solar Physics, Planets and Exoplanets', u'Electrochemistry', u'Electroanalytical Chemistry', u'Optical Properties of Materials', u'Physical Chemistry of Materials', u'Synthesis of Materials', u'Energy Generation, Conversion and Storage Engineering', u'Engineering Instrumentation', u'Materials Engineering', u'Metals and Alloy Materials', u'Renewable Power and Energy Systems Engineering (excl.

[u'Statistical Analysis of Electroplated Indium ( III ) Sulfide ( In 2 S 3 ) Films , a Potential Buffer Material for PV ( Heterojunction Solar Cells ) Systems , using Organic Electrolytes', ['Maqsood ali Mughal'], u'2015-04-27T02:03:00Z', u'In2S3 has received attention as an alternative to CdS as the buffer layer in heterojunction solar cells. Although having a bandgap of 2.0 eV relative to 2.5 eV for CdS, the lower toxicity and environmental impact of indium relative to cadmium, and significant photosensitivity, compel ongoing research [1]. Indium sulfide thin films were deposited onto molybdenum-coated glass (SiO2) substrates by electrodeposition from organic baths (ethylene glycol-based) containing indium chloride (InCl3), sodium chloride (NaCl), and sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O 3.5H2O), the latter used as an additional sulfur source along with elemental sulfur (S). The Taguchi method was used to optimize the deposition paramters so as to minimize non-uniformity, cracks, and improper stoichiometry. The measured performance characteristics (molar ratio (In:S) and crack density) for all of the In2S3 films were calculated to analyze the effect of each deposition factor (deposition voltage, deposition temperature, composition of solution, and deposition time) involved in the electrodeposition process by calculating the sensitivity (signal to noise, S/N, ratios).', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Statistical_Analysis_of_Electroplated_Indium_III_Sulfide_In_2_S_3_Films_a_Potential_Buffer_Material_for_PV_Heterojunction_Solar_Cells_Systems_using_Organic_Electrolytes/1394715', [u'Solar System, Solar Physics, Planets and Exoplanets', u'Electrochemistry', u'Optical Properties of Materials', u'Physical Chemistry of Materials', u'Synthesis of Materials', u'Metals and Alloy Materials', u'Materials Engineering', u'Engineering Instrumentation', u'Energy Generation, Conversion and Storage Engineering'], []]
[u'Progress in Indium (III) Sulfide (In2S3) Buffer Layer Deposition Techniques for CIS, CIGS, and CdTe-based Thin Film Solar Cells', ['Maqsood ali Mughal'], u'2015-08-02T03:23:18Z', u'Recent progress with indium (III) sulfide (In2S3)-buffered thin film solar cells (TFSC) was briefly reviewed. In2S3 has emerged as a promising low-hazard buffer (or window) material, and has proven to improve the properties of the solar cells, while reducing toxicity. Various deposition techniques have been employed to synthesize In2S3 films on different types of substrates. Until now, atomic layer deposition (ALD) and ionic layer gas atomic reaction (ILGAR) techniques have been the two most successful, yielding maximum energy conversion efficiencies up to 16.4% and 16.1%, respectively. The impact of varied deposition parameters upon the In2S3 film properties and performance of cadmium (Cd)-free solar cells has been outlined. A comparative/operational analysis (solar cell efficiencies above 9% reported for cell area \u2264 1cm2) of various buffer layers used in two primary types of TFSC technology: chalcopyrite (CIS/CIGS)- and CdTe-based solar cells was also performed to measure the progress of In2S3 compared to its counterparts.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Progress_in_Indium_III_Sulfide_In2S3_Buffer_Layer_Deposition_Techniques_for_CIS_CIGS_and_CdTe_based_Thin_Film_Solar_Cells/1500799', [u'Solar System, Solar Physics, Planets and Exoplanets', u'Chemical Characterisation of Materials', u'Electrochemistry', u'Crystallography', u'Optical Properties of Materials', u'Synthesis of Materials', u'Elemental Semiconductors', u'Energy Generation, Conversion and Storage Engineering', u'Materials Engineering', u'Metals and Alloy Materials'], []]
