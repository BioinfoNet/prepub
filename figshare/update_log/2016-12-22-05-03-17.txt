[u'Fish Nutrient Excretion Rates New York', ['Alexander Alexiades'], u'2016-12-21T18:36:55Z', u'Each year, millions\nof hatchery raised fish are stocked annually into streams and rivers worldwide,\nyet the effects of hatchery raised fish on stream nutrient cycles has seldom\nbeen examined. We quantified the influence of supplemental non-native fish\nstocking, a widespread recreational fishery management practice, on in-stream\nnutrient storage and cycling. We predicted that supplemental, hatchery-raised\nbrown trout (Salmo trutta) stocking\nwould result in increased N and P supply relative to in-stream biotic demand\nfor those nutrients and that stocked fishes would remineralize and store a\nsignificantly greater amount of N and P than the native fish community, due to\nhigher areal biomass. To test these predictions, we measured the biomass,\nnutrient (NH4+-N and soluble reactive phosphorus)\nremineralization rates, and body carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus content of\nthe native fish community and trout stocked into four study streams. We then\nestimated fish growth rates to determine species-specific nutrient\nsequestration rates in body tissues for both stocked and native fish and\nmeasured ammonium and phosphorus uptake rates to determine the relative\ninfluence of net fish nutrient remineralization on stream nutrient cycles. When\nbrown trout were stocked in these systems at density levels that were orders of\nmagnitude higher than ambient native fish density, they provided a sizeable\nsource of NH4+-N that could account for up to 85% of\ndemand for that nutrient. Stocked trout had minimal effects on in-stream\nsoluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) cycles even at high release densities, likely\ndue to low per capita SRP excretion rates. A unique feature of our study was\nthat we evaluated the temporal component of the stocked trout nutrient subsidy\nby estimating the number of fish removed from the system through natural\nmortality and angler harvest which indicated that the stocked trout subsidy\nlasted approximately 6-8 weeks after stocking. By combining population models\nwith areal nutrient excretion rates and estimates of biotic nutrient uptake, we\nshowed that trout stocking provided a strong pulsed nutrient subsidy.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Fish_Nutrient_Excretion_Rates_New_York/4488389', [u'Animal Physiological Ecology'], []]
