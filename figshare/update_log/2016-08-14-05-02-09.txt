In-house\ndeveloped Perl-scripts were used to search and process the data, and to\ntranslate each gene-level mutation into a mutated peptide sequence. The\ncancer mutation database comprises a total of 872,125 peptide entries from 25,642 protein IDs. A description\nline for each entry provides the parent protein ID and name, the cDNA- and\nprotein-level mutation site and type, the originating database, and the cancer tissue type and corresponding hits. The database is FASTA\nformatted to enable data retrieval by commonly used tandem MS search engines.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/XMAn_A_Homo_sapiens_Mutated_Peptide_Database/2825557', [u'Cancer', u'Bioinformatics', u'Systems Biology', u'Medical Biochemistry: Proteins and Peptides (incl.
