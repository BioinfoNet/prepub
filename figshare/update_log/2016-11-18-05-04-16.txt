[u'Data for preprint: Viral coinfection is shaped by bacterial ecology and virus-virus interactions across diverse microbial taxa and environments: Version 2', ['Samuel Diaz-Munoz'], u'2016-11-17T21:59:58Z', u'Infection\nof more than one virus in a host, coinfection, is common across taxa and\nenvironments. Viral coinfection can enable genetic exchange, alter the dynamics\nof infections, and change the course of viral evolution. Yet, the factors influencing\nthe frequency and extent of viral coinfection remain largely unexplored. Here,\nemploying three microbial data sets of virus-host interactions covering\ncross-infectivity, culture coinfection, and single-cell coinfection (total: 6,564\nmicrobial hosts, 13,103 viruses), I found evidence that ecology and virus-virus\ninteractions are recurrent factors shaping coinfection patterns. Host ecology\nwas a consistent and strong predictor of coinfection across all three datasets:\npotential, culture, and single-cell coinfection. Host phylogeny or taxonomy was\na less consistent predictor, being weak or absent in potential and single-cell\ncoinfection models, yet it was the strongest predictor in the culture\ncoinfection model. Virus-virus interactions strongly affected coinfection. In\nthe largest test of superinfection exclusion to date, prophage infection reduced\nculture coinfection by other prophages, with a weaker effect on\nextrachromosomal virus coinfection. At the single-cell level, prophages\neliminated coinfection. Virus-virus interactions also increased culture coinfection with ssDNA-dsDNA coinfections >2x\nmore likely than ssDNA-only coinfections. Bacterial defense limited single-cell\ncoinfection in marine bacteria CRISPR spacers reduced coinfections by ~50%, despite\nthe absence of spacer matches in any active infection. Collectively, these\nresults suggest the environment bacteria inhabit and the interactions among\nsurrounding viruses are two factors consistently shaping viral coinfection\npatterns. These findings highlight the role of virus-virus interactions in\ncoinfection with implications for phage therapy, microbiome dynamics, and viral\ninfection treatments.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Data_for_preprint_Viral_coinfection_is_shaped_by_bacterial_ecology_and_virus_virus_interactions_across_diverse_microbial_taxa_and_environments/2072929', [u'Microbiology', u'Ecology', u'Evolutionary Biology', u'Virology'], []]
