[u'Sexual conflict and the evolution of asexuality at low population densities', ['Nina Gerber'], u'2016-10-06T08:41:51Z', u'Theories for the evolution of sex rarely include facultatively sexual reproduc-\ntion. Sexual harassment by males is an underappreciated factor: it should at\nfirst sight increase the relative advantage of asexual reproduction by increasing\nthe cost of sex. However, if the same females can perform either sexual\nor asexual life cycles, then females trying to reproduce asexually may not\nescape harassment. If resisting male harassment is costly, it might be beneficial\nfor a female to accept a mating and undertake a sexual life cycle rather than\n\u2018insist\u2019 on an asexual one. We investigate the effects of sexual harassment on\nthe maintenance of sex under different population densities. Our model\nshows that resisting matings pays off at low population densities, which\nleads to the complete extinction of males, and thus to the evolution of comple-\ntely asexual populations. Facultative sex persists in a narrow range of slightly\nhigher densities. At high densities, selection favours giving up resisting male\nmating attempts and thus sexual reproduction takes over. These interactions\nbetween the outcomes of sexual conflict and population density suggest an\nexplanation for the rarity of facultative sex and also patterns of geographical\nparthenogenesis, where marginal environments with potentially low densities\nare associated with asexuality.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/dynamics_m/3987513', [u'Evolutionary Biology'], []]
