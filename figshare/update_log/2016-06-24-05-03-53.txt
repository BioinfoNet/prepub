[u'Baseline Analysis of Ground Water Quality Around Open Dumpsites in Lagos, Nigeria: Focus on Polynuclear Aromatic Hydrocarbons', ['Olumayowa Dayo, MPH', 'Barry Ryan, PhD'], u'2016-06-23T21:20:03Z', u'Providing a sustainable means of waste disposal is one of the major problems in Lagos. For many years, the government has practiced improper waste disposal methods to dispose of the waste generated in the city. The objective of this study was to evaluate groundwater contamination around two open dumpsites, focusing on the presence of a known carcinogen, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon. Pollution in the study area was measured by sampling water from boreholes and wells in houses around open dumpsites.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Baseline_Analysis_of_Ground_Water_Quality_Around_Open_Dumpsites_in_Lagos_Nigeria_Focus_on_Polynuclear_Aromatic_Hydrocarbons/3459617', [u'Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety'], []]
