[u'BioNetDB: a storage engine for the integration and analysis of biological networks', ['Daniel Perez-Gil', 'Pedro Furio-Tari', 'Antonio Fabregat Mundo', 'Felipe Javier Chaves-Martinez', 'Pablo Marin-Garcia', 'Ignacio Medina'], u'2015-11-25T15:15:26Z', u'One of the main goals of biomedical research is to understand biological processes as a system to model all the complex interactions between their molecular components. These biological processes such as gene regulation, signal transduction, protein-protein interaction or metabolic pathways are often represented in the form of biological networks. Their modelling, analysis, and visualization are essential for uncovering important properties of the underlying biological system. In addition, biological networks are not isolated, but there are a lot of different and complex interactions between them. Currently, there is not a database to store and explore this complexity, only a graph-based database that embraces relationships as a core aspect of its data model is able to store, process, and query connections efficiently. Therefore, analyzing biological networks with graph concepts provides us the opportunity to model a network of thousands of interacting components and gives us clues about how their organization and connection influences their function and dynamic responses. Here we present BioNetDB, a storage engine to work with biological networks using a NoSQL graph database. BioNetDB integrates relevant biological network information from well-known data sources and provides access to this data through a comprehensive RESTful web services API or using the command line interface.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/BioNetDB_a_storage_engine_for_the_integration_and_analysis_of_biological_networks/1612189', [u'Systems Biology', u'Computational  Biology', u'Bioinformatics', u'Biotechnology'], []]
