Twenty two rice cultivars were tested against five salt levels (0, 4, 8, 12 and, 24 dSm-1). Using shoot, root parameters and its percentage reduction with salt levels and sodium to potassium ratio, grouping of rice cultivars and their significances were tested by using cluster analysis. Four groups were identified as; highly tolerant, tolerant, susceptible and very susceptible. ANOVA and correlation analysis were performed to check the significant differences among cultivars with in clusters and correlation between tested variables, respectively. Values of all tested variables decreased with increasing salt levels in all tested cultivars except for sodium to potassium ratio in shoots. Percentage reduction increased with increasing salt levels for shoot height, shoot dry weight, root length, root dry weight and root surface area and showed significant differences among the cultivars at salt level of 24 dSm-1. Both osmotic andtoxic effect reduced shoot and root growth by inhibiting the water absorption by roots and caused leaf death, respectively.

In Mycorrhizal (M) plants, root colonization rates were significantly lower with the addition of high Cd concentration (600 mg.kg_1). AM inoculation increased shoot and root biomass at 100 mg kg_1 Cd addition but cause a reduction at 300 and 600mg.kg-1. Shoot and root Cd concentrations in mycorrhizal (M) plants were lower at all levels (0, 100, 300 and 600 mg.kg-1) and Cd accumulation and uptake efficiency were lower in M plants. AM inoculation improved shoot and root P nutrition at all Cd levels.

Cd toxicity induced proline accumulation and significant reduction of antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD, POD, CAT, APX) were observed in NM plants however proline contents were lower in M except the higher Cd concentration (600 mg.kg-1).

Unfortunately, about 30% of this product is ruined during the period from picking season to the consumption. High capacity of ethylene production is the main reason for rapid ripening and high level waste of tomato after production. The main purpose behind the present research was to study the impacts of different concentrations of 1-methy cyclopropen on ethylen Production and physicochemical properties of tomato type "Rapsona" picked during the color fracture. For this purpose 4 groups of tomato samples were at 20\xb0C under 0.35, 0.7, 1 and 1.35 \u03bcL/L MCP was dissolved. The fifth group was considered as the control group (without MCP), and then Total soluble solids, acidity, color and ethylene were measured. Experimental design included factorial experiment in a completely randomized design with 3 replications. Results showed that MCP solutions could control the effects of ethylene air around the tomato, sothat the concentration of ethylene accumulated in containers of various treatments was significantly reduced. MCP at concentrations of 0.35, 0.7,1 and 1/35 \u03bcL/L reduced the ethylene for about 28, 80, 200 and 420 percent respectively. Moreover, the ripening time increased and led to the delay in the redness of the fruit, so that the R value for the samples treated by 0.35, 0.7,1 and 1.35 \u03bcL/L MCP increased respectively about 5, 15, 30 and 34%. Use of MCP at concentration 0/7 \u03bcL/L and contact time of 24 hours, leads to 15-18 days delay in the ripening time of tomato. MCP at 1/35 \u03bcL/L delayed the maturity successfully, but due to the lack of color uniformity of the product, was not recommended.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Effects_of_1-methyl_cyclopropene_1_MCP_on_ethylen_production_and_physicochemical_properties_of_tomato_type_Rapsona/1480921', [u'Microbiology', u'Soil Science', u'Education', u'Biological Techniques', u'Botany', u'Agricultural Engineering', u'Zoology', u'Plant Biology', u'Environmental Science', u'Marine Biology', u'Biological Engineering', u'Planetary Geology', u'Immunology', u'Molecular Biology', u'Cell Biology', u'Evolutionary Biology'], []]

At first hydrological and hydraulic approaches in the study stream were investigated. In the next step, physical habitat in macro scale was evaluated. Based on the results in normal conditions 10% of mean annual flow (MAF) according to the Tennant criterion and also 25% of MAF determined in the region of Atlantic in Canada are not suitable for this type of stream. Theoretically, calculation of maximum curvature in wetted perimeter method will produce the best answer for environmental flow assessment considering the physical macro habitat. But scientifically this flow cannot be applicable in these streams. In the range of 80% to 100% of MAF, minimum habitat suitability condition will be created, if the restoration and rehabilitation habitat condition techniques in moderate level are used.

The field study revealed thepresence of inconstant male of O. baccatus in different forms ranging from high fruit-producing to low or nonfruit producing forms with two intermediate forms. The pollen morphology of all the four forms was examined using LM and SEM. This study is the first dealing with pollen grain morphological diversity within different O. baccatus populations, representing model of the inconstant male of a gynodioecious species. Generally, theexamined Ochradenus baccatus pollen grains appeared under SEM as 3-colporate, isopolar, radiallysymmetrical, with reticulate exine sculpturing. This study revealed the presence of a variability in pollen size, shape, aperture and exine sculpturing in different forms.

The eigenvalue and eigenvectors of the plant species and EPA were graphed, and the correlation between the species selection index by sheep and goats and the eigenvalue of the PCA axis for each plant species were calculated. Results indicated that while there was no significant difference between grazing time of sheep and rangeland plant composition, a significant relation was found between grazing time of goat and rangeland plant composition. Hence, it can be concluded that goat is not selective as they grazed plants in proportion to their forage yield and canopy cover in the field. Moreover, there is a significant relationship between the species' selection by sheep and goats and EPA.
