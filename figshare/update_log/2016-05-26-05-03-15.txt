The movie scans bottom to top of the z slice image stack (0 to 2 sec) and\nthen reverses through the image stack superimposing an isosurface 3-D model to\nreveal three cells (colored blue) and nine nanopods, which are indicated by\ncontrasting colors. The model is then rotated to allow visualization of\nnanopods from different angles (11 sec). The movie then shows details of\nnanopods in the following series of steps. 1. Zoom to Nanopod 1 (14 sec).\xa0 2. Slice through the volume revealing\nintercellular connection formed by Nanopod 1 (21 sec). 3. Zoom out and rotate\nto Nanopod 2 (27 sec). 4. Slice through the volume revealing intercellular connection\nformed by Nanopod 2 (31 sec). 5. Move to Nanopod 4 (39 sec). 6. Slice through\nthe volume revealing cellular connection formed by Nanopod 4 (43 sec). 7. Move\nalong the length of Nanopod 4 (48 sec). Slice through the volume revealing\nconnection formed to a second cell by Nanopod 4 (43 sec). 8. Zoom out and\nrotate to Nanopod 5 (59 sec). 9.

[u'SmithRNAs: could mitochondria \u2018bend\u2019 nuclear regulation?', ['Andrea Pozzi', 'Fabrizio Ghiselli', 'Marco Passamonti'], u'2016-05-25T15:43:08Z', u'This poster is part of a broad study on mitochondrial\nbiology, performed through a non-canonical experimental model of mitochondrial\ninheritance, the Doubly Uniparental Inheritance (DUI), in the Manila clam Ruditapes\nphilippinarum. DUI evolved from maternal inheritance of Mitochondria and\nhas been proposed to be a resolved genomic conflict, triggered by\nselfish genes of putative viral origin, invading mtDNAs of some bivalve\nspecies, and switching ancestral hermaphroditism into gonochorism. Accordingly, mitochondria in DUI species were\nsuggested to affect the genetic cascade of germ line determination,\nand RNA interference was a reasonable candidate mechanism for this\nfeature. Actually, in small RNA libraries from enriched mitochondrial fractions\nof clam testes and ovaries, we found several small non coding RNAs (sncRNAs),\nproduced by either F- or M-mtDNAs. We therefore named them: small mitochondrial highly\ntranscribed RNAs (smithRNAs).', u'https://figshare.com/articles/SmithRNAs_could_mitochondria_bend_nuclear_regulation_/3398620', [u'Evolutionary Biology'], []]
