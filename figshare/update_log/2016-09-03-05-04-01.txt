[u'Information, Time and the Human Mind', ['Hartmut Ising'], u'2016-03-30T09:23:51Z', u'Quantum approaches to consciousness seem to explain several but not all\nobservations in the field of mind-brain interaction. Information is introduced\nas a key to a wider world view since we have \u2013 according to\nThomas Nagel \u2013 to transcend the built-in limits of contemporary scientific\northodoxy before we may understand mind. In the macroscopic world\ninformation is limited in contrast to the capability of our mind to work with\nunlimited information in mathematics. The world of mathematical concepts with\nunlimited information is independent of time and space and the mind is an\nintermediary between the macroscopic and the mathematical world. In the\nmacroscopic world time is unidirectional while for the mind as well as in quantum\nphysics time is bidirectional. In a given experimental system a photon carries 1\nbit of information. Using a double slit gedankenexperiment it is shown that the\ntransmission of the information from the photon to the detector takes the time\nspan delta t = \u03bb/c and Planck\u2019s formula\nfor the energy of the photon can be interpreted as Planck\u2019s constant h multiplied by the elementary information flux (1bit) c/\u03bb. The time span was\ndetermined by an observer in the macroscopic world. For the photon, however, time does not flow and space is shrunk to zero. For\nthe discussion of time in quantum physical\nmeasurements these two viewpoints have to be distinguished. We may describe\nthe photon as the elementary information unit in a world independent of time\nand space. The world of the photon is evidence for the existence of the world of\nmathematical concepts which is independent of time and space. When the information is transmitted\nfrom the world of the photon to the world of the detector it is absorbed and the loss of\n1 bit information causes an increase of energy in the system. For complex information\nthe hypothesis of an extended energy conservation law is formulated. An experimental\ntest of the hypothetical equivalence of energy and information flux is necessary\nas a next step on the way which could lead to a better understanding of\nconsciousness as well as to a quantitative theory of information.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Information_Time_and_the_Human_Mind/3123175', [u'Biological Sciences', u'Biophysics', u'Biological Physics', u'Quantum Physics', u'Psychology', u'Philosophy', u'Human Information Behaviour', u'Information Engineering and Theory'], []]
