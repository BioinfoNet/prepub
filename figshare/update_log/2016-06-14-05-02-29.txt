[u'Data for: Soil inoculation steers restoration of terrestrial ecosystems', ['Jasper Wubs'], u'2016-06-13T11:48:44Z', u"Study design In the Reijerscamp Natuurmonumenten established a large \nfield experiment in 2006. There were four experimental areas (Area A-D).\n In each area large top-soil excavations were made down to the minaral \nsoil (top-soil removal (rem) & untreated controls (cont)). In each \nof the excavated areas treatments were performed where 1) sods were \nadded (sod), 2) where mixed soil was spead out (soil), and there was a \ncontrol where nothing further had been done (cont) all additions \nwere collected from well-developped seminatural sites (sods: Doorwerthse\n Heide, Wolfheze, Soil: Dennenkamp, Planken Wambuis) Outside the \nexcavations the soil & control treatments were also performed just \nas inside the top-soil excavations. The sod addition treatment was not \nperformed outside the top soil excavations . Hence in total there were 4\n experimental areas, with 5 treatments each, creating 20 sampling \nlocations. Within each sampling location a transect of 5 plots was laid \nout, with the centre plot in the middle of the sampling location. The \norientation of the transect was decided randomly as far a the size of \nthe treatment in each sampling location permitted (see tab 'transect \norientation' in the primary data files). Each plot was 1x1m and the \nspacing between plot edges was 5 m (hence each transect from the far \nedges of plot 1 & 5 spans 25 m). All data in the primary data files \nwere sampled in this way.", u'https://figshare.com/articles/Data_for_Soil_inoculation_steers_restoration_of_terrestrial_ecosystems/3435404', [u'Community Ecology (excl.

[u'Atypical Salmonella enterica serovars in murine and human infection models: Is it time to reassess our approach to the study of salmonellosis?', ['Daniel Hurley', 'Maria Hoffmann', 'Tim Muruvanda', 'Marc W. Allard', 'Eric W. Brown', 'Marta Martins', 'Seamus Fanning'], u'2016-06-13T08:01:51Z', u'Nontyphoidal Salmonella\nspecies are globally disseminated pathogens and the predominant\ncause of gastroenteritis. The pathogenesis of salmonellosis has been\nextensively studied using in vivo murine models and cell lines typically\nchallenged with Salmonella Typhimurium. Although serovars\nEnteritidis and Typhimurium are responsible for the most of human\ninfections reported to the CDC, several other serovars also contribute to\nclinical cases of salmonellosis. Despite their epidemiological importance,\nlittle is known about their infection phenotypes. Here, we report the virulence\ncharacteristics and genomes of 10 atypical S. enterica serovars linked\nto multistate foodborne outbreaks in the United States. We show that the murine\nRAW 264.7 macrophage model of infection is unsuitable for inferring\nhuman relevant differences in nontyphoidal Salmonella infections whereas\ndifferentiated human THP-1 macrophages allowed these isolates to be further\ncharacterised in a more relevant, human context.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Atypical_Salmonella_enterica_serovars_in_murine_and_human_infection_models_Is_it_time_to_reassess_our_approach_to_the_study_of_salmonellosis_/3364726', [u'Microbiology'], []]
