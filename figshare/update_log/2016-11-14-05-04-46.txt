[u'Mapping the sub-cellular proteome', ['Laurent Gatto'], u'2016-11-13T14:59:20Z', u'In biology, localisation is function. Cells display a complex sub-cellular structure with numerous distinct niches responsible for specific biological processes. Consequently, not only must proteins be present to accomplish their biological functions, but they must be localised at their intended sub-cellular locations. In contrast, mis-localised proteins can have serious advert consequences. In this talk, I will present how contemporary experimental and computational technologies can be used to produce proteome-wide proteins localisation maps.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Mapping_the_sub_cellular_proteome/1572983', [u'Systems Biology', u'Computational  Biology', u'Bioinformatics', u'Computer Software', u'Cell Biology'], []]
