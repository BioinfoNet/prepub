Shift\nwork and in particular night shifts may increase the risk of disease. Further, studies\nsuggest that shift workers have a higher level of sickness absence than day workers.\nHowever, research on the impact of shift work on the risk of sickness absence\nis sparse, and there is a need for high-quality research including detailed and\nprecise information on shift work. The present study protocol describes the\nmethods of two studies with the aims to study: a) if exposure to night shift prospectively\npredicts sickness absence of different durations and b) if working hour\ncharacteristics e.g. time of day and time between shifts predict sickness\nabsence.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/STUDY_PROTOCOL_Examining_the_short_term_risk_of_sickness_absence_following_shift_work_in_a_cohort_study_with_register-based_payroll_data_/3457838', [u'Epidemiology'], []]
