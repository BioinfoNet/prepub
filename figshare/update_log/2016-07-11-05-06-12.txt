[u'Drug Discovery and ADMET process: A Review', ['Preeti Patil'], u'2016-07-10T15:29:04Z', u'Pharmaceutical\ndrug discovery is an expensive and time-consuming process. In order to have one\neffective and safe drug, millions of molecules are screened. A successful IND\napplication requires that the sponsor demonstrate reasonable evidence\nconcerning safety of the candidate molecule.\xa0\nThis evidence is derived from a battery of in vitro assays as well as in\nvivo studies using animals.\xa0 Animal\nstudies often fail to predict clinical results due to inter-species differences\nin enzymes, transporters and biochemical pathways.\xa0 Although many in vitro assays use human\ncells, they lack the interplay of body systems and biochemical pathways.\xa0 Due to these shortcomings, both in vitro and\nin vivo studies often fail to predict clinical outcomes. Nearly 30% of\nmolecules entering clinical trials fail because of insufficient safety. This\ninadequacy opens opportunities for new technologies that can address these\nissues, thereby leading to a more predictive human model. In addition, due to\ntime-consuming and expensive nature of in vivo studies, improved in vitro\nassays that lead to reduction in animal usage present interesting\nopportunities. With these ideas in mind we framed the objective to summarize\nthe in vitro ADME/T tests in order to\nbetter predict human clinical outcomes.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Drug_Discovery_and_ADMET_process_A_Review/3478955', [u'Pharmacology'], []]
[u'Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship Study of MF-63 (Phenanthrene Imidazole Series) Derivatives for mPGES-1 Inhibitory Activity', ['Kulbhushan Sharma'], u'2016-07-10T15:44:37Z', u'Inhibition of COX-2 signaling has been one\nof the strategies to reduce occurrence and aggressiveness of many cancer types.\nDue to several side effects associated with the direct targeting of COX-2,\ninhibition of various other key players in COX-2 signaling like mPGES-1 is\nsuggested. MF-63 is known to inhibit mPGES-1; a crucial component of COX-2\nsignaling. In this study, a quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR)\nwas performed on eighteen bioactive MF-63 (phenanthrene imidazole) derivatives.\nInitially 3224 molecular descriptors were obtained using DRAGON software and\nfinally a model was developed using five of them. For variable selection,\nGenetic Algorithm (GA) method was used. The model was build using Partial Least\nSquare Regression (PLSR). The most significant model generated was having\ncorrelation coefficient (r2) of 0. 9421 cross validated correlation coefficient\n(q2) of 0. 7888, F-test value of 81.33, r2 for external test set (pred_ r2)\n0.6011, coefficient of correlation of predicted data set and (pred_r2se)\n0.9706. Descriptors found suitable to construct the model included radial\ndistribution function (RDF110u), GETAWAY descriptor (R3u), Moran\nAutocorrelation descriptor (MATS5v) and MoRSE descriptors (Mor28v and Mor31p).\nAs these descriptors majorly belong to electronic and structural properties,\nour proposed model indicated that these properties significantly contribute towards\nthe potency of MF-63 derivatives. The current study will aid in the future\ndesigning and development of more potent mPGES-1 inhibitors as anti-cancer\nagents.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Quantitative_Structure_Activity_Relationship_Study_of_MF-63_Phenanthrene_Imidazole_Series_Derivatives_for_mPGES-1_Inhibitory_Activity/3478961', [u'Cancer'], []]
