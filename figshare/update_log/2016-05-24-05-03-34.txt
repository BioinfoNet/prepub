[u'2016_Evolution_poster_Final (3) .pptx', ['Megan Serr'], u'2016-05-23T20:33:53Z', u'House mice are\ninvasive pests on islands, where they pose significant conservation concerns\nfor native species. Genetic engineering may pose an alternative to the\ntraditional method of toxicants as a means of rodent eradication on islands. Ongoing\nresearch efforts are aimed at creating a strain of mice genetically engineered\nto produce offspring sex ratios that are heavily male-biased with the goal of\nsuppressing invasive mouse populations on islands. Successful implementation of\nthis approach depends on engineered hybrid males mating successfully in complex\nenvironments. This project explores the genetic and behavioral differences\nbetween Mus musculus strains in terms\nof mating and fecundity using wild house mice derived from an invasive\npopulation on the Farallon islands (MmF) and two laboratory strains: standard\nC57/Bl6 (B6) and males with the \u2018t allele\u2019 (tw2), a naturally\noccurring meiotic drive system. To begin to assess fertility in hybrid crosses,\nlab B6 males were paired with wild derived females (MmF) and all females gave\nbirth to litters. Males carrying the t allele (tw2) were also paired\nwith wild- derived females from the Farallon islands (MmF). Results of both\nmatings indicate a significant difference in litter size with both hybrid\nlitters having fewer offspring', u'https://figshare.com/articles/2016_Evolution_poster_Final_3_pptx/3395860', [u'Population Ecology'], []]
[u'Microstructure informed tractography: pitfalls and open challenges', ['Alessandro Daducci', 'Alessandro Dal Palu', 'Maxime Descoteaux', 'Jean-Philippe Thiran'], u'2016-05-23T12:02:38Z', u'One of the major limitations of diffusion MRI tractography is that the fiber tracts recovered by existing algorithms are not truly quantitative. Local techniques for estimating more quantitative features of the tissue microstructure exist, but their combination with tractography has always been considered intractable. Recent advances in local and global modeling made it possible to fill this gap and a number of promising techniques for microstructure informed tractography have been suggested, opening new and exciting perspectives for the quantification of brain connectivity. The ease-of-use of the proposed solutions made it very attractive for researchers to include such advanced methods in their analyses; however, this apparent simplicity should not hide some critical open questions raised by the complexity of these very high-dimensional problems, otherwise some fundamental issues may be pushed into the background. The aim of this article is to raise awareness in the diffusion MRI community, notably researchers working on brain connectivity, about some potential pitfalls and modeling choices that make the interpretation of the outcomes from these novel techniques rather cumbersome. Through a series of experiments on synthetic and real data, we illustrate practical situations where erroneous and severely biased conclusions may be drawn about the connectivity if these pitfalls are overlooked, like the presence of partial/missing/duplicate fibers or the critical importance of the diffusion model adopted. Microstructure informed tractography is a young but very promising technology, and by acknowledging its current limitations as done in this paper, we hope our observations will trigger further research in this direction and new ideas for truly quantitative and biologically meaningful analyses of the connectivity.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Microstructure_informed_tractography_pitfalls_and_open_challenges/3394990', [u'Neuroscience', u'Image Processing', u'Neurosciences', u'Applied Mathematics', u'Optimisation'], []]
[u'Critical role of Kupffer cell CD89 expression in experimental IgA nephropathy', ['Lijun Xu'], u'2016-05-23T09:37:23Z', u'In this study,\nwe generated a CD89 transgenic mouse strain using an authentic murine CD14\npromotor with\nCD89 expression on blood and tissue monocytes/macrophages. These animals, however,\nshowed no signs of IgAN but displayed concomitant increased clearance of mouse\nserum IgA.In\nthese experiments Kupffer cells were the predominant cell type in the\ndegradation of experimentally-induced human IgA, especially human IgA1 catabolized\nby these cells. Injecting large quantities of purified IgA from IgAN patients\ninto CD89 Tg mice triggers IgAN, and concomitant dysfunctional endocytosis and\nelimination of patient IgA, resulting in the deposition of CD89-IgA in kidneys\nof Tg mice. Our results indicate that although CD89 plays an important role\nin IgA and IgA-IC clearance, defective endocytosis of underglycosylated IgA is necessary\nfor the\ndevelopment of experimental IgAN.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Critical_role_of_Kupffer_cell_CD89_expression_in_experimental_IgA_nephropathy/3394930', [u'Nephrology and Urology'], []]
