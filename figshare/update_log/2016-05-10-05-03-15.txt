[u'Methodology development for environmental microbiology: Medium formulation and surface charge analysis', ['Wenfa Ng'], u'2016-05-09T16:53:03Z', u'Lack of adequate cell mass\nhampers many fields allied to biotechnology. Besides providing sufficient\nmaterial for ensuring minimum levels of analytical accuracy, high cell mass\nbuttresses against batch-to-batch variation in analysis as well as enabling\nproof-of-concept experiments at larger scales. Conventional methods for\nincreasing cellular material revolves around scaling up fermentation using\nincreasing sizes of bioreactors; however, high cost and complexity of operation\nprecludes the widespread adoption of fermenters in universities laboratories,\nwhere the workhorse for cell production and experimentation is the shake-flask.\nWhile useful and amenable to linear scale-up through parallel cultivation,\nshake-flask\u2019s main bugbear lies in the relatively low cell density achievable\nduring cultivation of various bacteria in commercial growth media. Why? Strong\nindications suggest that reliance on fed-batch culture with provision of\nsupplemental carbon sources reduce motivation for developing growth medium\nsuitable for batch culture. This thesis reports a formulated medium capable of\nproviding 3 times higher optical density for Escherichia coli DH5\u03b1\n(ATCC 53868) compared to LB Lennox medium under aerobic culture at 37 oC\nand 230 rpm. Cell count data via the aerobic spread plate method further reveals\nthat the formulated medium was able to support a larger population of viable\ncells over a longer period of time relative to Tryptic soy broth.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Methodology_development_for_environmental_microbiology_Medium_formulation_and_surface_charge_analysis/3363478', [u'Biological Engineering'], []]
