[u'Is It a Bird? Is it a Plane? - Detection of biological motion by Western scrub-jays', ['Katharina Brecht', 'Ljerka Ostojic', 'Nicola S. Clayton'], u'2016-10-24T11:22:07Z', u'Western\nScrub-jays take into account what others can see and hear when protecting their\nhidden caches from potential pilferers, suggesting that they may have Theory of\nMind-like abilities. In humans, the ability to detect biological motion\nprecedes the development of Theory of Mind and may be an important prerequisite\nfor it. Human infants attend to point-light animation sequences depicting human\nmovement from an early age, preferring it to sequences depicting\nnon-biological, random movement. In this study, we addressed the question of whether\nor not Western scrub-jays would show a similar preference to observe biological\nmotion patterns compared to a random motion pattern. Birds had access to two\npeepholes, allowing them to choose between random motion and three different\ntypes of biological motion patterns: a biological motion of another scrub-jay (Experiment\n1), a familiar biological motion pattern of a cat walking (Experiment 2) and an\nunfamiliar biological motion pattern of a horse (Experiment 3). Across all\nthree experiments, scrub-jays did not reliably prefer to observe biological\nmotion. One interpretation is that a preference for biological motion patterns might\nnot be associated with Theory of Mind-like abilities in scrub-jays.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/BiologicalMotion_DuCog2016/4055163', [u'Animal Behaviour'], []]
[u'Data of Temporal Frequency Discrimination in Amblyopia', ['xubo yang'], u'2016-10-24T10:08:51Z', u'A flickering disk was used for visual stimuli. A two alternative forced choice\n(2AFC) staircase paradigm was used to measure the temporal frequency\ndiscrimination thresholds of amblyopic eyes, fellow eyes and normal eyes under reference temporal frequencies of 5, 10 and 20 Hz.\nThe data of just-noticeable differences and Weber fractions were analyzed\nstatistically. Moreover, the temporal frequency discrimination thresholds (5\nand 10 Hz) of the subjects were measured under the circumstances of more and less\nattention distribution. The changes in temporal frequency\ndiscrimination thresholds were compared between amblyopic and normal eyes\nwhen attention was allocated.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Data_of_Temporal_Frequency_Discrimination_in_Amblyopia/4055073', [u'Ophthalmology'], []]
