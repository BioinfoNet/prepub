[u'Target enrichment of thousands of ultraconserved elements sheds new light on early relationships within New World sparrows (Aves: Passerellidae)', ['Robert Bryson', 'Brant Faircloth', 'Whitney Tsai', 'John McCormack', 'John Klicka'], u'2016-05-31T16:48:44Z', u'Sparrows in the nine-primaried oscine family Passerellidae represent an\nattractive model for studying avian diversification across North and South\nAmerica. However, the lack of phylogenetic resolution at the base of the New\nWorld sparrow tree has hampered the use of the existing sparrow phylogeny to\ntest questions about the evolution of sparrow traits. We generated phylogenomic\ndata from 1,063 ultraconserved elements to estimate phylogenetic relationships\namong the major clades of New World sparrows. Concatenated and species tree\nanalyses of 271,830 base-pairs of sequence data converged on a well-supported phylogeny\nthat differs from previous estimates. The resolved backbone of the sparrow phylogeny\nprovides new insight into the biogeography of this radiation by suggesting both\na tumultuous biogeographic history with many colonizations of South America, as\nwell as several independent ecological transitions to different habitat types.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Target_enrichment_of_thousands_of_ultraconserved_elements_sheds_new_light_on_early_relationships_within_New_World_sparrows_Aves_Passerellidae_/3101359', [u'Evolutionary Biology', u'Phylogeny and Comparative Analysis'], []]
