[u'Climate change has a negative impact on the indo-pacific cleaner wrasse social behavior and abundance', ['zegni triki', 'sharon wismer', 'elena levorato', 'redouan bshary'], u'2016-12-18T13:30:46Z', u'Climate change poses a major\nthreat to coral reef ecosystems worldwide. Here, we present the immediate\nnegative effects of recent cyclones and the 2016 El Ni\xf1o on the abundance of cleaner\nwrasse Labroides dimidiatus (hereafter \u2018cleaner\u2019), a key species for\nfish biodiversity on coral reefs. We report that 80% of cleaner densities was\nlost. Consequently, several repercussions on cleaners social behavior were\nobserved. We outline significant decline in the ability of cleaner to manage\ntheir own reputation and strategically prioritize certain category of client\nreef fish, previously documented as key components of cleaner high cognitive\nperformance in the cleaning mutualism. Thus, contemporary climate change may\ncause diverse and unexpected effects on species abundance and social\ninteractions, possibly due to the loss of more complex cognition.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Climate_change_has_a_negative_impact_on_fish_cognitive_sophistication/4234886', [u'Animal Behaviour', u'Behavioural Ecology', u'Marine Biology', u'Ecological Impacts of Climate Change'], []]
