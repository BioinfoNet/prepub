[u'The ecology and management of urban pondscapes', ['Christopher Hassall', 'Matthew Hill', 'David Gledhill', 'Jeremy Biggs'], u'2016-08-21T22:30:06Z', u'Small water bodies provide valuable \u2018blue space\u2019 in urban environments, creating a network of\nsemi-natural habitat patches for wildlife as well as providing a wide range of\necosystem services.\xa0 However, the diverse\nand interacting anthropogenic stressors imposed by the urban environment pose\nconsiderable challenges for the effective management of these habitats. We outline some of the key factors that appear to\ninfluence urban pond biodiversity: land use with the local (and often\nsmall-scale) catchment, the connectivity of ponds through the landscape, and\nthe nature of emergent and riparian vegetation. We argue that all three factors\ncan be incorporated into a landscape-scale planning framework that can target\nparticular areas for creation and amelioration of pond habitats.\xa0 Such a joined-up approach is currently\nlacking from most urban planning frameworks, but could provide an opportunity\nto maximise services provided by urban wetlands at the landscape scale.\xa0 We emphasise the application of recent\necological advances in our understanding of urban ponds to management\nguidelines, which have largely come in the form of gardening guides. This\nmanagement will be required not only to enhance the biodiversity value of urban\nponds, but also to control the less desirable elements of aquatic biodiversity\nsuch as invasive species and disease vectors that may pose a particular risk in\nurban environments.\xa0 Finally, we note the\nlack of a comprehensive conservation strategy for ponds and highlight key\nlegislation and guidance that can help to fill the gap. The fact that pond\nvalue lies in the aggregation of multiple habitats distributed through the\nlandscape challenges our existing approach to habitat protection.\xa0 However,\ncontemporary approaches to pond creation for mitigation through planning\nprocesses and programmes of pond creation provide an opportunity to implement\ntruly large-scale strategic habitat management. It is imperative that ecologists and conservationists are\ninvolved in the future planning process and its implementation.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/The_ecology_and_management_of_urban_pondscapes/3749235', [u'Community Ecology (excl.

Many studies have focused on the biological response of terrestrial\ntaxa and habitats to urbanization. However, little is known regarding the\nconsequences of urbanization on freshwater habitats, especially small lentic\nsystems. In this study we examined aquatic macroinvertebrate diversity (family\nand species level) and variation in community composition between 240 urban and\n782 non-urban ponds distributed across the UK. Contrary to predictions, urban\nponds supported similar numbers of invertebrate species and families compared\nto non-urban ponds. Similar gamma diversity was found between the two groups at\nboth family and species taxonomic levels. The biological communities of urban\nponds were markedly different to those of non-urban ponds and the variability\nin urban pond community composition was greater than that in non-urban ponds,\ncontrary to previous work showing homogenisation of communities in urban areas.\nPositive spatial autocorrelation was recorded for urban and non-urban ponds at\n0-50 km (distance between pond study sites) and negative spatial\nautocorrelation was observed at 100-150 km, and was stronger in urban ponds in\nboth cases. Ponds do not follow the same ecological patterns as terrestrial and\nlotic habitats (reduced taxonomic richness) in urban environments; in contrast they\nsupport high taxonomic richness and contribute significantly to regional faunal\ndiversity. Individual cities are complex structural mosaics which evolve over long\nperiods of time and are managed in diverse ways, promoting the development of a\nwide-range of environmental conditions and habitat niches in urban ponds which\ncan promote greater heterogeneity between pond communities at larger scales. Ponds\nprovide an opportunity for managers and environmental regulators to conserve\nand enhance freshwater biodiversity in urbanized landscapes whilst also facilitating\nkey ecosystem services including storm water storage and water treatment.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Urban_ponds_as_an_aquatic_biodiversity_resource_in_modified_landscapes/3749232', [u'Freshwater Ecology', u'Population Ecology', u'Biogeography and Phylogeography', u'Landscape Ecology', u'Natural Resource Management', u'Conservation and Biodiversity'], []]
[u'Phenological shifts in hoverflies (Diptera: Syrphidae): linking measurement and mechanism', ['Christopher Hassall', 'Jennifer Owen', 'Francis Gilbert'], u'2016-08-21T22:09:22Z', u'An\nunderstanding of ecological and evolutionary responses to global environmental\nchange requires both a robust measurement of the change that is occurring and a\nmechanistic framework for understanding the drivers of that change. Such a\nrequirement provides a challenge because biological monitoring is often ad hoc,\nand mechanistic experiments are often performed under highly simplified\nconditions. This\nstudy integrates multiple datasets to evaluate our current knowledge of the\nmeasurement and mechanism of phenological shifts in a key pollinator taxon: the\nhoverflies (Diptera: Syrphidae). First, two large, complementary and\nindependent monitoring datasets are used to test for trends in phenology: an ad\nhoc national recording scheme containing >620,000 records, and standardised\nmonitoring with consistent methods over 30 years. Results show that ad hoc and\nstandardised recording data give quantitatively the same value for phenological\nadvance in hoverflies (ca. 12 days\xd7\xb0C-1 on average at the beginning of the flight\nperiod), supporting the value of biological recording for the measurement of\nglobal ecological change. While the end of the flight period appears static in\nad hoc recording, the standardised dataset suggests a similar advance as in the\nbeginning of the flight period. Second, an extensive traits dataset and a novel\ndatabase of laboratory-derived developmental data on Syrphidae (153 published\nstudies) are used to test for mechanistic patterns in phenological shifts. The\nonly species trait that influenced phenology was voltinism, where species with\nmore generations per year exhibit stronger phenological advances. We\ndemonstrate considerable variation in the laboratory-derived sensitivity to\ntemperature but this does not match field-derived measures of phenology. The results\ndemonstrate that, as for many taxa, we have a strong understanding of the\npatterns of global ecological change but that we currently lack a detailed\nmechanistic understanding of those processes despite extensive research into\nthe fundamental biology of some taxonomic groups.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Phenological_shifts_in_hoverflies_Diptera_Syrphidae_linking_measurement_and_mechanism/3749229', [u'Community Ecology (excl.

[u'A bee or not a bee: an experimental test of acoustic mimicry by hoverflies', ['Christopher Hassall'], u'2016-08-21T22:07:20Z', u'The degree of\nsimilarity between Batesian mimics and their models varies widely and occurs\nacross a range of sensory modalities. We use three complementary experimental\nparadigms to investigate acoustic mimicry in hoverflies (Diptera: Syrphidae)\nwhich mimic stinging Hymenoptera.\xa0First, we analyse sounds made by 13 hoverfly\nspecies and 9 Hymenoptera species with and without simulated predation (\u201calarm\u201d\nand \u201cflight\u201d sounds, respectively). We demonstrate that the bumblebees Bombus terrestris, B. hortorum, and B.\nlucorum, and the hoverfly Cheilosia\nillustrata exhibit alarm sounds that are significantly different to their\nrespective flight sounds, and indistinguishable between species. We then\ndemonstrate that the B. terrestris alarm sound reduces predation on\nartificial prey by wild birds, but that the hoverfly mimic alarm sound does not.\nFinally, we trained chicks to avoid distasteful food in the presence of\ndifferent acoustic stimuli. Overall the chicks showed no difference in response\nto bee and hoverfly stimuli, demonstrating no innate aversion to the Bombus alarm sound. We therefore\nconclude that (i) similarity of acoustic signals exists among Hymenoptera and\nhoverflies, (ii) acoustic aposematic signals (but not the almost identical\nmimetic signals) are effective at reducing predation, and (iii) wild birds\nexhibit learned rather than innate aversion to certain acoustic stimuli.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/A_bee_or_not_a_bee_an_experimental_test_of_acoustic_mimicry_by_hoverflies/3749226', [u'Evolutionary Biology', u'Behavioural Ecology'], []]
