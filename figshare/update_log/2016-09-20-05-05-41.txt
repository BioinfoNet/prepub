[u'Woodlot Dataset 4', ['karandeep chahal'], u'2016-09-20T01:32:20Z', u"Using a sample size of 10 adult trees,\ncontinuous data was collected that involved adult white spruce trees and their\ntrunk diameter at breast height, canopy coverage of the sky, the distances that\nthe trees were to their closest sapling white spruce trees and also the diameter\nof the nearest sapling white spruce trees. The research was conducted in a\nwoodlot environment near Hoover house on York University campus at 4:00 pm. The\nresearchers were Karandeep, Didar and Sophia. Firstly, the diameter of an adult\ntree was calculated using a simple measuring tape and holding the tape from one\nside of the trunk to the other. Secondly, the canopy coverage involved making a\nsquare with one's index fingers and thumbs and standing under a white spruce\nadult tree. The square was then pointed upwards, toward the branches, and an\nestimation of sky coverage was recorded. Next, a sapling white spruce tree was\nfound near the adult tree and the distances between the two was calculated using\nthe transect measuring tape - holding the tape from the adult trunk to the\nsapling trunk. Lastly, the sapling tree's diameter was calculated exactly how it\nwas for the adult tree - holding the measuring tape from one side of the trunk\nto the other. It is hypothesized that the greater the dbh of an adult tree\nwould ultimately imply a greater canopy coverage area. This is because the\ngreater dbh already implies that the tree is strong and stirdy and thus would\nhave more branches for a greater coverage of the sky. It is also hypothesized\nthat the smaller the distance an adult tree is from a sapling tree, the smaller\nits canopy coverage would be for the adult tree. This is because a sapling tree\ndid not have enough nutrients to grow into an adult and most likely, if a same\nspecies tree is near it, it too will face the same environment and not grow\nwith a significantly great canopy coverage in relation to adult trees that are\nfarther away from the sapling. \xa0The\ngreatest error when collecting this data would have to include the lack of\nspace for research which ultimately did not give fully accurate\nmeasurements.", u'https://figshare.com/articles/Woodlot_Dataset_4/3840405', [u'Terrestrial Ecology'], []]
[u'Using Demographic Analyses to Evaluate the Impact of Man-made Disasters on Imperiled Species: Piping Plovers and the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill', ['gibsond@vt.edu'], u'2016-09-19T15:14:26Z', u'Even in the presence of environmental safeguards,\ncatastrophic accidents related to anthropogenic activities occur that can result\nin both immediate and chronic impacts on local biota. However, due to the\nunplanned nature of catastrophes, studies aimed to identify the effects of\nthese accidents on an ecosystem and its inhabitants often have imperfect study\ndesigns that are reactive rather than proactive, resulting in methodological\nand analytical challenges. On 20 April 2010, following an explosion on the Deepwater\nHorizon, a well blowout occurred on the seafloor approximately 80 km off the\nLouisiana coast in the Gulf of Mexico. This blowout resulted in the largest\nmarine oil spill in United States history, which impacted critical migratory\nstopover and overwintering habitat for many seabird and shorebird species,\nincluding species of high conservation concern such as the piping plover (Charadrius melodus). Here, we assessed\nthe potential short-term and carry-over demographic impacts of the Deepwater\nHorizon oil spill on piping plovers in a capture-mark-recapture framework. We\nexamined whether a series of demographic processes, including probabilities of\nremaining at a specific wintering site, over-winter and annual apparent\nsurvival, winter stopover duration, and abundance varied among oiled and\nunoiled habitats. We found that the perceived amount of oiling on land, in\nwater, and on individual birds, as well as numerous demographic processes, were\nspatially or temporally variable. However, we found no support that piping\nplover demography was negatively influenced by the magnitude of oil observed at\nan impacted area, or that demographic rates substantially varied between reference\nand oil impacted areas. Nor did we find that piping plovers that were observed\nto be oiled had lower survival probabilities following the DWH oil spill\nrelative to non-oiled individuals from the same winter population. Although we\ndid not find that the Deepwater Horizon oil spill substantially influenced piping\nplovers, our methods provide an analytical framework to more appropriately\naddress both the short or long-term impacts of an anthropogenic disturbance on\na species.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Using_Demographic_Analyses_to_Evaluate_the_Impact_of_Man-made_Disasters_on_Imperiled_Species_Piping_Plovers_and_the_Deepwater_Horizon_Oil_Spill/3799182', [u'Population Ecology'], []]
