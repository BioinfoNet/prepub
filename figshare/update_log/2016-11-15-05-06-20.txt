[u'The hypothesis of connecting two spinal cords as a way of sharing information between two brains and nervous systems', ['Amilcar Silva-dos-Santos'], u'2016-11-15T00:23:38Z', u'Direct communication between different nervous systems\nhas been recently reported through brain to brain interfaces and brainet. Closed loops systems between a brain\nand the spinal cord from the same individual have also been demonstrated. However, the connection between different\nnervous systems through spinal cord has not yet been\nconsidered. This paper raises the hypothesis of connecting two spinal\ncords (spinal cord \u2013 spinal cord connection) as an indirect mean for\ncommunication of two brains and a direct way of communication between two nervous\nsystems. A concept of electrical drug or\nelectrical fingerprint of a chemical drug\nis introduced. The notion of the\nconnection between two parts of the same spinal cord to treat a paraplegic\npatient is also introduced. It is discussed that external\ninformation injected to a\xa0 spinal cord as\nwell as\xa0 spinal cord \u2013 spinal cord connection\ncan become new tools to 1) study the physiology of the nervous system, 2)\nmodeling specific behaviors, 3) study and modeling disease traits 4)\ntreating\xa0 neuropsychiatric disorders and\n5) information sharing between two nervous systems.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/The_hypothesis_of_connecting_two_spinal_cords_as_a_way_of_sharing_information_between_two_brains_and_nervous_systems/4233026', [u'Neuroscience'], []]
[u'A neurophysiological hypothesis of how adverse life events convert into abnormal brain oscillations: focus on unipolar depression and bipolar disorder', ['Amilcar Silva-dos-Santos'], u'2016-11-15T00:04:32Z', u'The\nmechanisms underlying depression (either in\nunipolar depressive disorder or bipolar disorder) are not entirely understood.\nThe decrease in serotonin neurotransmission in one of the primary hypothesis\nregarding the origin of depression and drugs that increase serotonin levels are\nwidely used to treat depression. It is well known that adverse life events can\ntrigger or worsen depression. It has been reported abnormal brain oscillation\nin depression and also hypothesized that at least, in part, this abnormal brain\noscillation might share some features with the neurophysiology of epilepsy.\nHere I propose a hypothesis that links the decreased serotonin levels, adverse\nlife events, and abnormal brain oscillation. This notion may raise the\nawareness about how adverse life events can be converted into abnormal brain\noscillations.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/A_neurophysiological_hypothesis_of_how_adverse_life_events_convert_into_abnormal_brain_oscillations_focus_on_unipolar_depression_and_bipolar_disorder/4233002', [u'Psychiatry (incl.
