[u'BocaRatonPaper.pdf', [' '], u'2016-07-15T11:31:13Z', u'Arthur Clark and Michael Kube\u2013McDowell\n(\u201cThe Triger\u201d, 2000) suggested the sci-fi idea about the direct transformation\nfrom a chemical substance into another by the action of a newly physical,\n\u201cTrigger\u201d field. Karl Brohier, a Nobel Prize winner, who is a dramatic persona\nin the novel, elaborates a new theory, re-reading and re-writing Pauling\u2019s \u201cThe\nNature of the Chemical Bond\u201d; according to Brohier: \u201cInformation organizes and\ndifferentiates energy. It regularizes and stabilizes matter. Information\npropagates through matter-energy and mediates the interactions of\nmatter-energy.\u201d Dr Horton, his collaborator in the novel replies: \u201cIf the\nuniverse consists of energy and information, then the Trigger somehow alters\nthe information envelope of certain substances \u2013\u201c.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/BocaRatonPaper_pdf/3487184', [u'Quantum Chemistry', u'Quantum Information, Computation and Communication', u'Quantum Mechanics', u'Philosophy'], []]
