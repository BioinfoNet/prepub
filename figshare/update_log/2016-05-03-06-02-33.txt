To perform reliable\nhigh-quality data, PCR master mix, and equipment need to be optimal. However,\ngeneral lab optimized protocols are widely used for different gene targets and\nperformed diversely between conditions. Our main objective was to test\nthe robustness of different commercial SYBR green PCR mixes with respect to\nspecificity and sensitivity of the PCR assay. This was tested across various\nPCR machines and amplification protocols for assessment of mRNA transcript\nlevels, DNA copy numbers, and DNA genotypes.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/The_source_of_SYBR_Green_master_mix_determines_outcome_of_nucleic_acid_amplification_reactions/3207802', [u'Biotechnology'], []]
