[u'Mitochondrial selfish elements and the evolution of biological novelties', ['Fabrizio Ghiselli', 'Liliana Milani', 'Marco Passamonti'], u'2016-06-09T16:09:37Z', u'RPHM21 is a\nrecently discovered protein encoded by a male-specific mitochondrial genome,\nand with a putative role in the paternal inheritance of sperm mitochondria in\nthe Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum,\na species characterized by the doubly uniparental inheritance of mitochondria\n(DUI). The available evidence suggests a viral origin of RPHM21 and supports\nits activity during spermatogenesis: RPHM21 is progressively accumulated in\nmitochondria and nuclei of spermatogenic cells, and we hypothesize it can\ninfluence mitochondrial inheritance and sexual differentiation.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Mitochondrial_selfish_elements_and_the_evolution_of_biological_novelties/3426176', [u'Evolutionary Biology'], []]
