[u'PowerPoint Slides for:  Distinct in vitro Complement Activation by Various Intravenous Iron Preparations', ['Hempel J.C.', 'Poppelaars F.', 'Gaya da Costa M.', 'Franssen C.F.M.', 'de Vlaam T.P.G.', 'Daha M.R.', 'Berger S.P.', 'Seelen M.A.J.', 'Gaillard C.A.J.M.'], u'2016-11-30T16:06:10Z', u'Background: Intravenous (IV) iron preparations are widely used in the treatment of anemia in patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD). All IV iron preparations carry a risk of causing hypersensitivity reactions. However, the pathophysiological mechanism is poorly understood. We hypothesize that a relevant number of these reactions are mediated by complement activation, resulting in a pseudo-anaphylactic clinical picture known as complement activation-related pseudo allergy (CARPA). Methods: First, the in-vitro complement-activating capacity was determined for 5 commonly used IV iron preparations using functional complement assays for the 3 pathways. Additionally, the preparations were tested in an ex-vivo model using the whole blood of healthy volunteers and HD patients. Lastly, in-vivo complement activation was tested for one preparation in HD patients. Results: In the in-vitro assays, iron dextran, and ferric carboxymaltose caused complement activation, which was only possible under alternative pathway conditions. Iron sucrose may interact with complement proteins, but did not activate complement in-vitro. In the ex-vivo assay, iron dextran significantly induced complement activation in the blood of healthy volunteers and HD patients. Furthermore, in the ex-vivo assay, ferric carboxymaltose and iron sucrose only caused significant complement activation in the blood of HD patients. No in-vitro or ex-vivo complement activation was found for ferumoxytol and iron isomaltoside. IV iron therapy with ferric carboxymaltose in HD patients did not lead to significant in-vivo complement activation. Conclusion: This study provides evidence that iron dextran and ferric carboxymaltose have complement-activating capacities in-vitro, and hypersensitivity reactions to these drugs could be CARPA-mediated.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/New_draft_item/4270112', [u'Medicine'], []]
[u'PowerPoint Slides for: Trajectories and Predictors of Allograft Dysfunction after Renal Transplantation in Children', ['de Souza V.C.', 'Rabilloud M.', 'Cochat P.', 'Wagner M.B.', 'Garcia C.D.', 'Ranchin B.', 'Iwaz J.', 'Selistre L.', 'Dubourg L.'], u'2016-11-30T15:52:50Z', u"Background: The survival rates of renal transplant children are indeed on the rise, but it is still important to ensure that there is optimal renal function in these children in all their future growing years. The number of functioning nephrons and the graft ability to adapt to an increasing demand during body growth seem to be the most important factors for long-term allograft function. This study examined the long-term change in the glomerular filtration rate in a pediatric kidney transplant cohort and the importance of the recipient and donor ages in predicting transplant outcome. Methods: Data on 67 renal transplant children who underwent 278 inulin-clearance measurements between 2000 and 2010 were examined. A longitudinal latent class model was used to identify renal function trajectories and classify the children. Results: This model identified 3 trajectories of renal allograft function after pediatric kidney transplantation: \u2018low and decreasing', \u2018moderate and stable', and \u2018high and sharply decreasing'. The probability of belonging to the low and decreasing trajectory - that is, the poorer outcome - was lower in recipients of grafts from living versus deceased donor (adjusted OR (aOR) 0.02; p = 0.03). This probability increased with recipient age (aOR 1.20 per year of recipient ageing; p = 0.07) and donor-recipient age-difference (aOR 1.13 per additional year; p = 0.07). Conclusion: This study suggests that donation from living donors and from younger donors are favorable factors for long-term allograft function.", u'https://figshare.com/articles/PowerPoint_Slides_for_Trajectories_and_Predictors_of_Allograft_Dysfunction_after_Renal_Transplantation_in_Children/4270106', [u'Medicine'], []]
