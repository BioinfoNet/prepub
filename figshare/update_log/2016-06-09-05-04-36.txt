[u'The Doubly Uniparental Inheritance (DUI) of mitochondria: a model system for mito-nuclear coevolution', ['Fabrizio Ghiselli', 'Liliana Milani', 'Marco Passamonti'], u'2016-06-08T16:49:47Z', u"Mitochondria are\na fundamental component of eukaryotic life, representing much more than just\n'the power plants of the cell'. Nevertheless, the current knowledge about their\nbiology (e.g. heredity, biogenesis) and function is largely incomplete, and\nmostly biased toward a few taxonomic groups. Focusing the research on a small\nand homogeneous subset of organisms entails the risk of losing a big part of\nthe molecular and functional diversity of mitochondria.", u'https://figshare.com/articles/The_Doubly_Uniparental_Inheritance_DUI_of_mitochondria_a_model_system_for_mito-nuclear_coevolution/3423355', [u'Evolutionary Biology'], []]
[u'OpenZika: An IBM World Community Grid Project to Accelerate Zika Virus Drug Discovery', ['Sean Ekins', 'Alexander Perryman', 'Carolina Horta Andrade'], u'2016-06-08T06:24:40Z', u'A preprint of an article submitted to a journal - The Zika virus outbreak in the\nAmericas has caused global concern, and to help this fight against Zika we\nlaunched the OpenZika project. OpenZika is an IBM World Community Grid Project that uses distributed computing on millions of computers and\nAndroid devices to run docking experiments, in order to dock millions of drug-like\ncompounds against crystal structures and homology models of Zika proteins (and\nother related flavivirus targets). This will enable the identification of new virtual\ncandidates that can then be tested in\nvitro, to advance the discovery and development of new antiviral drugs\nagainst the Zika virus. The docking data will be made openly accessible so that\nall members of the global research community can use it to further advance drug\ndiscovery studies for Zika and other viruses.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/OpenZika_An_IBM_World_Community_Grid_Project_to_Accelerate_Zika_Virus_Drug_Discovery/3422905', [u'Infectious Diseases'], []]
