[u'Global map of Zika Virus', ['Abdallah Samy'], u'2016-08-27T16:10:06Z', u'The Americas are presently experiencing the most serious known \noutbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV). Here, we present a novel set of analyses \nusing environmental characteristics, vector mosquito distributions, and \nsocioeconomic risk fac-tors to develop the first map to detail global \nZIKV transmission risk in multiple dimensions based on ecological niche \nmodels. Our model predictions were tested against independent evaluation\n data sets, and all models had predictive ability significantly better \nthan random expectations. The study addresses urgent knowledge gaps \nregarding (1) the potential geographic scope of the current ZIKV \nepidemic, (2) the global potential for spread of ZIKV, and (3) drivers \nof ZIKV transmission. Our analysis of potential drivers of ZIKV \ndistributions globally identified areas vulnerable in terms of some \ndrivers, but not for others. The results of these analyses can guide \nregional education and preparedness efforts, such that medical personnel\n will be better prepared for diagnosis of potential ZIKV cases as they \nappear.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Global_map_of_Zika_Virus/3756123', [u'Infectious Diseases', u'Diseases'], []]
