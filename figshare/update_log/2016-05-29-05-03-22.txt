[u'Atorvastatin for treating spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage: study protocol for a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial', ['Junhui Chen'], u'2016-05-28T09:29:05Z', u'Background: Animal studies have confirmed\nthat statins have neuroprotective effects during and following a subarachnoid\nhemor\xadrhage; however, the therapeutic effect of statins in humans remains\ncontroversial. The interpretation of data currently available on the clinical\napplication of statins to spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage is limited by the\nsmall sample sizes used in the studies, making it difficult to draw valid\nconclusions regarding the multiple neuroprotective effects of statins. Thus, we\npropose to perform a random\xadized double-blind placebo-controlled parallel-group\nclinical trial to determine the effects of atorvastatin on spontaneous\nsubarachnoid hemorrhage, apoptosis-related factors, and serum inflammatory\nfactors in cerebrospinal fluid and to observe its neuroprotective effect\nmediated by relieving vasospasm.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Atorvastatin_for_treating_spontaneous_subarachnoid_hemorrhage_study_protocol_for_a_randomized_double-blind_placebo-controlled_trial/3406573', [u'Neurosciences'], []]
[u'Role of DLBS1033 in the management of acute ischemic stroke patients: study protocol for a randomized controlled study', ['Maruli  Simangunsong'], u'2016-05-28T09:24:56Z', u'Background: In Indonesia,\nthe incidence of stroke is growing rapidly every year and it becomes a burden\nto the government. Medica\xadtions improving neurological function are required,\nin order to increase patient\u2019s quality of life. There were an enzyme\n(lumbrokinase) secreted from the alimentary tract of earthworm and it has\nanti-thrombotic and thrombolytic effect so that it can be beneficial in the\nmanagement and prevention of stroke. DLBS1033 is a standardized bioactive\nprotein fraction derived from Lumbricus rubellus through a patented\ntechnology of extraction. DLBS1033 has been shown to have antithrombosis and\nthrombolytic activities. The safety profile of DLBS1033 was also demonstrated\nin toxicology studies, animal studies, and in healthy adult subjects. Based on\nits mechanism of action and safety profile, DLBS1033 can be considered\nbeneficial on acute ischemic stroke patients. Through this clinical study, we\nwill evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product in acute ischemic stroke\nmanagement.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Role_of_DLBS1033_in_the_management_of_acute_ischemic_stroke_patients_study_protocol_for_a_randomized_controlled_study/3406567', [u'Neurosciences'], []]
[u'HD6610 granules relieve oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy: study protocol for a multicenter randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial', ['Jiege Huo'], u'2016-05-28T09:06:48Z', u'Background: Oxaliplatin, a\nplatinum-based cytotoxic agent, is a widely used chemotherapeutic agent.\nSmall-sample clinical trials and animal experiments have shown that Jiawei\nHuangqi Guizhi Wuwu Tang (a decoction of five components, including Radix\nAstragali and Ramulus Cinnamomi) effectively reduces peripheral\nneuropathy caused by oxaliplatin, but no confirmation exists from a prospec\xadtive,\nmulticenter, randomized, controlled, blinded clinical trial.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/HD6610_granules_relieve_oxaliplatin-induced_peripheral_neuropathy_study_protocol_for_a_multicenter_randomized_double-blind_placebo-controlled_trial/3406555', [u'Neurology and Neuromuscular Diseases', u'Peripheral Nervous System', u'Pharmaceutical Sciences'], []]
[u'68Ga-BNOTA-PRGD2 PET/CT for evaluation of post-stroke angiogenesis: study protocol for a prospective open-label clinical trial', ['Zhaohui Zhu'], u'2016-05-28T08:54:42Z', u'Background: Arginylglycylaspartic acid\n(RGD) is a tripeptide composed of L-arginine, glycine, and L-aspartic acid that\nshows great affinity for the integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 receptor. A RGD dimer labeled with 68Ga, 68Ga-BNOTA-PRGD2 was designed\nfor positron-emission to\xadmography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging\npost-stroke angiogenesis, which has rarely been used in the clinic. We aimed to\nperform a prospective open-label trial to validate the diagnostic value of 68Ga-BNOTA-PRGD2 PET/CT in\npost-stroke angiogenesis.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/68Ga-BNOTA-PRGD2_PET_CT_for_evaluation_of_post-stroke_angiogenesis_study_protocol_for_a_prospective_open-label_clinical_trial/3406549', [u'Central Nervous System', u'Neurosciences', u'Nuclear Medicine'], []]

Our pre-clinical studies suggest that ozone therapy administered by\nautologous blood transfusion is a convenient and safe treatment for ischemic\nstroke, and is popular with patients, but its therapeutic benefits are not\nclear. We hypothesized that ozone therapy administered by autologous blood\ntransfusion for ischemic stroke is safe and effective, and propose a protocol\nfor a prospective, multi-center, open-label, large-sample, parallel,\nrandomized, non-blinded controlled trial.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Efficacy_and_safety_of_ozone_therapy_administered_by_autologous_blood_transfusion_for_acute_ischemic_stroke_study_protocol_for_a_multi-center_open-label_large-sample_parallel_randomized_controlled_trial/3406543', [u'Neurosciences'], []]
