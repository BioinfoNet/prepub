Recent interest in verifying 1D\u2009numerical schemes has led to the development of alternative experimental setups and the use of three-dimensional\u2009numerical models to acquire data not easily measured in vivo. In most studies to date, only one particular 1D\u2009scheme is tested. In this paper, we present a systematic comparison of six commonly used numerical schemes for 1D\u2009blood flow modelling: discontinuous Galerkin, locally conservative Galerkin, Galerkin least-squares finite element method, finite volume method, finite difference MacCormack method and a simplified trapezium rule method. Comparisons are made in a series of six benchmark test cases with an increasing degree of complexity. The accuracy of the numerical schemes is assessed by comparison with theoretical results, three-dimensional\u2009numerical data in compatible domains with distensible walls or experimental data in a network of silicone tubes. Results show a good agreement among all numerical schemes and their ability to capture the main features of pressure, flow and area waveforms in large arteries. All the information used in this study, including the input data for all benchmark cases, experimental data where available and numerical solutions for each scheme, is made publicly available online, providing a comprehensive reference data set to support the development of 1D\u2009models and numerical schemes.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/A_benchmark_study_of_numerical_schemes_for_one_dimensional_arterial_blood_flow_modelling/1586944', [u'Numerical Analysis', u'Biological Engineering'], []]
[u'Measures of Agreement Between Many Raters for Ordinal Classifications', ['Prof. Kerrie Nelson', 'Prof. Don Edwards'], u'2015-09-03T09:41:15Z', u'Screening and diagnostic procedures often require a physician\u2019s subjective interpretation of a patient\u2019s test result using an ordered categorical scale to define the patient\u2019s disease severity. Due to wide variability observed between physicians\u2019 ratings, many large-scale studies have been conducted to quantify agreement between multiple experts\u2019 ordinal classifications in common diagnostic procedures such as mammography. However, very few statistical approaches are available to assess agreement in these large-scale settings. Existing summary measures of agreement rely on extensions of Cohen\u2019s kappa [1 - 5]. These are prone to prevalence and marginal distribution issues, become increasingly complex for more than three experts or are not easily implemented. Here we propose a model-based approach to assess agreement in large-scale studies based upon a framework of ordinal generalized linear mixed models. A summary measure of agreement is proposed for multiple experts assessing the same sample of patients\u2019 test results according to an ordered categorical scale. This measure avoids some of the key flaws associated with Cohen\u2019s kappa and its extensions. Simulation studies are conducted to demonstrate the validity of the approach with comparison to commonly used agreement measures. The proposed methods are easily implemented using the software package R and are applied to two large-scale cancer agreement studies.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Measures_of_Agreement_Between_Many_Raters_for_Ordinal_Classifications/1514870', [u'Statistics', u'Medicine'], []]
[u'Data From: Multiple imputation for harmonizing longitudinal non-commensurate measures in individual participant data meta-analysis', ['Dr. Juned Siddique', 'Dr. Jerome Reiter', 'Dr. Ahnalee Brincks', 'Dr. Robert D. Gibbons', 'Prof. Catherine M. Crespi', 'Prof. C. Hendricks Brown'], u'2016-07-14T20:54:47Z', u'There are many advantages to individual participant data meta-analysis for combining data from multiple studies. These advantages include greater power to detect effects, increased sample heterogeneity, and the ability to perform more sophisticated analyses than meta-analyses that rely on published results. However, a fundamental challenge is that it is unlikely that variables of interest are measured the same way in all of the studies to be combined. We propose that this situation can be viewed as a missing data problem in which some outcomes are entirely missing within some trials, and use multiple imputation to fill in missing measurements. We apply our method to 5 longitudinal adolescent depression trials where 4 studies used one depression measure and the fifth study used a different depression measure. None of the 5 studies contained both depression measures. We describe a multiple imputation approach for filling in missing depression measures that makes use of external calibration studies in which both depression measures were used. We discuss some practical issues in developing the imputation model including taking into account treatment group and study. We present diagnostics for checking the fit of the imputation model and investigating whether external information is appropriately incorporated into the imputed values.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Multiple_imputation_for_harmonizing_longitudinal_non_commensurate_measures_in_individual_participant_data_meta_analysis/1466878', [u'Statistics', u'Medicine'], []]
[u'Data from: Reconstruction of full high-resolution HSQC using signal split in aliased spectra', ['Dr. Mohammadali Foroozandeh', 'Dr. Damien Jeannerat'], u'2016-07-14T19:16:55Z', u'Resolution enhancement is a long-sought goal in NMR spectroscopy. In conventional multidimensional NMR experiments, such as the 1H-13C HSQC, the resolution in the indirect dimensions is typically 10 to 100 times lower as in 1D spectra because it is limited by the experimental time. Reducing the spectral window can significantly increase the resolution, but at the cost of ambiguities in frequencies as a result of spectral aliasing. Fortunately, this information is not completely lost, and can be retrieved using methods in which chemical shifts are encoded in the aliased spectra and decoded after processing to reconstruct high-resolution 1H-13C HSQC spectrum with full spectral width and a resolution similar to that of 1D spectra. We applied a new reconstruction method called RHUMBA to spectra obtained using the DENA-HSQC and the new AMNA-HSQC experiments. The reconstructed spectra significantly facilitates both manual and automated spectral analysis and structure elucidation based on heteronuclear 2D experiments. The resolution is enhancement by two orders of magnitudes without the usual complications due to spectral aliasing.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Reconstruction_of_full_high_resolution_HSQC_using_signal_split_in_aliased_spectra/1575700', [u'Structural Biology', u'NMR Spectroscopy'], []]

In Trypanosoma brucei, SUMO is essential in procyclic and bloodstream forms. Furthermore, SUMO has been linked to the antigenic variation process, as a highly SUMOylated focus was recently identified within chromatin-associated proteins of the active VSG expression site. We aimed to establish a reliable strategy to identify SUMO conjugates in T. brucei. We expressed various tagged variants of SUMO from the endogenous locus. His-HA-TbSUMO was useful to validate the tag functionality but SUMO conjugates were not enriched enough over contaminants after affinity purification. A Lys-deficient SUMO version, created to reduce contaminants by Lys-C digestion, was able to overcome this issue but did not allow mapping many SUMOylation sites. This cell line was in turn useful to demonstrate that polySUMO chains are not essential for parasite viability. Finally, a His-HA-TbSUMOT106K version allowed the purification of SUMO conjugates and, after digestion with Lys-C, the enrichment for diGly-Lys peptides using specific antibodies. This site specific proteomic strategy led us to identify 45 SUMOylated proteins and 53 acceptor sites unambiguously. SUMOylated proteins belong mainly to nuclear processes such as DNA replication and repair, transcription, rRNA biogenesis, and chromatin remodelling, among others.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Different_proteomic_strategies_to_identify_genuine_SUMO_targets_and_their_modification_sites_in_Trypanosoma_brucei_procyclic_forms/1540859', [u'Cell Biology', u'Microbiology'], []]

Stephen Dumler M.D.'], u'2016-07-14T18:44:11Z', u'Control of host epigenetics is becoming evident as a mechanism by which symbionts and pathogens survive. Anaplasma phagocytophilum, an obligate intracellular bacterium, downregulates multiple host defense genes where histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) binds and histone 3 is deacetylated at their promoters, including the NADPH oxidase component, CYBB. How HDAC1 is targeted to defense gene promoters is unknown. Ankyrin A (AnkA), an A. phagocytophilum T4SS effector, enters the granulocyte nucleus, binds stretches of AT-rich DNA and alters transcription of antimicrobial defense genes, including downregulation of CYBB. Here we found AnkA binds to a predicted matrix attachment region in the proximal CYBB promoter. Using the CYBB promoter as a model of cis-gene silencing, we interrogated the mechanism of AnkA-mediated CYBB repression. The N-terminus of AnkA was critical for nuclear localization, the central ANK repeats and C-terminus were important for DNA binding, and most promoter activity localized to the central ANK repeats. Furthermore, a direct interaction between AnkA and HDAC1 was detected at the CYBB promoter, and was critical for AnkA-mediated CYBB repression. This novel microbial manipulation of host chromatin and gene expression provides important evidence of the direct effects that prokaryotic nuclear effectors can exert over host transcription and function.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Chromatin_bound_bacterial_effector_AnkA_recruits_HDAC1_and_modifies_host_gene_expression/1540853', [u'Cell Biology', u'Microbiology'], []]

We now study membrane acquisition of the NCLDV African swine fever virus (ASFV). By electron tomography (ET) the virion assembles a single bilayer derived open membrane precursors that collect as ribbons in the cytoplasm. Biochemically, lumenal ER proteins are released into the cytosol, arguing that the open intermediates are ruptured ER membranes. ET shows that viral capsid assembles on the convex side of the open viral membrane to shape it into an icosahedron. The viral capsid is composed of tiny spikes with a diameter of ~5nm, connected to the membrane by a 6nm wide structure displaying thin striations, as assessed by several complementary EM imaging methods. Immature particles display an opening that closes after uptake of the viral genome and core proteins, followed by the formation of the mature virion. Together with our previous data this study shows a common principle of NCLDVs to build a single internal envelope from open membrane intermediates. Our data now provide biochemical evidence that these open intermediates result from rupture of a cellular membrane, the ER.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/AFRICAN_SWINE_FEVER_VIRUS_ASSEMBLES_A_SINGLE_MEMBRANE_DERIVED_FROM_RUPTURE_OF_THE_ENDOPLASMIC_RETICULUM/1547921', [u'Cell Biology', u'Microbiology'], []]
