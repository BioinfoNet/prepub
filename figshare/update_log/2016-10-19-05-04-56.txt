[u'Cognitive control of saccadic eye movements in children with developmental coordination disorder', ['CLAUDIA GONZALEZ', 'Burke S', 'Mon-Williams M', 'Burke MR'], u'2016-10-18T19:43:53Z', u'The ability to prepare and execute a movement in response to\nadvance information requires cognitive control of behaviour (e.g., attention\ncontrol and prediction). Our aim was to explore the integrity of forward models\nin eye movement control and examine the ability of children with DCD and\ntypically developing children (TD) (8-12 yrs) to plan and inhibit their\nsaccadic responses (i.e., the inhibition and anticipation mechanisms involved\nin attention control). Eye movements and touch responses were measured (separately\nand concurrently during coordination) in Cued and Non-Cued conditions. Children\nwith DCD showed normal saccadic kinematics, including saccade initiation. Cue\ninformation decreased movement duration in both groups but touch accuracy was\nworse in the DCD group. Children with DCD exhibited increased inhibitory errors\nand inaccurate fixation in the Cued trials. Children with DCD seem proficient\nin executing saccades, but show deficits in more complex processing such as\ninhibition. The lack of inhibitory control had a direct impact on the\nallocation of visual attention and hindered the motor program compared to TD\ncontrols. Saccadic control and attentional deficits (lack of inhibition) may\nexplain why internal models needed for motor programming are compromised. These\nfindings have implications for theories regarding the aetiology of DCD.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Cognitive_control_of_saccadic_eye_movements_during_movement_planning_in_children_with_developmental_coordination_disorder/2069529', [u'Developmental Psychology and Ageing', u'Vision Science'], []]
[u'Advancing Bag-of-Visual-Words Representations for Lesion Classification in Retinal Images', ['Ramon Pires', 'Herbert F. Jelinek', 'Jacques Wainer', 'Eduardo Valle', 'Anderson Rocha'], u'2016-10-18T17:30:45Z', u'Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a complication of diabetes that can lead to blindness if not timely discovered. Automated screening algorithms have the potential to improve identification of patients who need further medical attention. However, the identification of lesions must be accurate to be useful for clinical application. The bag-of-visual-words (BoVW) algorithm employs a maximum-margin classifier in a flexible framework that is able to detect the most common DR-related lesions such as microaneurysms, cotton-wool spots and hard exudates. BoVW was developed to bypass the need for pre- and post-processing of the retinographic images, as well as the need of specific ad hoc techniques for identification of each type of lesion. An extensive evaluation of the BoVW model, using three large retinograph datasets (DR1, DR2 and Messidor) with different resolution and collected by different healthcare personnel, was performed. The results demonstrate that the BoVW classification approach can identify different lesions within an image without having to utilize different algorithms for each lesion reducing processing time and providing a more flexible diagnostic system. Our BoVW scheme is based on sparse low-level feature detection with a Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF) local descriptor, and mid-level features based on semi-soft coding with max pooling. The best BoVW representation for retinal image classification was an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) of 97.8% (exudates) and 93.5% (red lesions), applying a cross-dataset validation protocol. To assess the accuracy for detecting cases that require referral within one year, the sparse extraction technique associated with semi-soft coding and max pooling obtained an AUC of 94.2\xb12.0%, outperforming current methods. These results indicate that, for retinal image classification tasks in clinical practice, BoVW is equal and, in some instances, surpasses results obtained using dense detection (widely believed to be the best choice in many vision problems) for the low-level descriptors.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Advancing_Bag_of_Visual_Words_Representations_for_Lesion_Classification_in_Retinal_Images/953671', [u'Medicine', u'Diseases'], []]
