[u'Size, Composition, and Source Profiles of Inhalable Bioaerosols from Colorado Dairies', ['Jarrad Hampton-Marcell', 'Joshua.Schaeffer@colostate.edu'], u'2016-11-18T16:12:04Z', u'Agricultural particulate\npollution is a global health risk among workers and nearby residents. This\nparticulate matter contains a wide range of chemical and biological constituents\n(bioaerosols) with aerodynamic diameters consistent with the inhalable\nfraction. Due to sampling and analytical limitations, major gaps exist in\nunderstanding the relative contribution of large particles (i.e., 10-100 \xb5m)\nand their physiological relevance in respiratory disease. We evaluated the full\ndistribution of dairy inhalable particulate matter (IPM) using a novel\nhigh-volume cascade impactor that segregated airborne dust into four aerodynamic\nsize fractions: >30, 10-30, 3-10, and <3 \u03bcm.\nWe analyzed these size-fractionated particles using multiple chemical and\nbiological methods, including high-throughput DNA sequencing, to better\nunderstand the heterogeneity of bioaerosols, in particular: (1) bacterial\ncommunities, (2) opportunistic pathogens, and (3) inflammatory potential. Based\non particulate mass, a bimodal size distrubution was observed with one\nmode under 3 \xb5m and a second mode above 30 \xb5m. Correlations between inhalable particulate\nmatter and bacterial chemical markers were statistically signficant indicating\nthat large particles need to be considered during assessements otherwise a\nlarge proportion of exposure (and health outcomes) may go unnoticed. Further, bacteria\nin bioaerosols were derived predominantly from animal sources, but other\nnoteworthy sources included birds, water, soil, and humans. Taxa such as Staphlyococcus, Pseudomonas, and Streptococcus\nwere identified, which have important implications in infectious disease in the\ncontext of the lung and nasal microbiome. This is the first study to\ncharacterize the full size distribution of airborne particles emitted by\nagricultural dairy operations. The size, composition, and\nspeciation of IPM in this study suggest that both small and large particles are\nof concern and more research is needed to better understand health effects in the\nupper respiratory system, including the\nnasopharyngeal region.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Size_Composition_and_Source_Profiles_of_Inhalable_Bioaerosols_from_Colorado_Dairies/4239830', [u'Microbial Ecology'], []]
