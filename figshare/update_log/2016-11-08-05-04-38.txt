Here we present Tadarida, a software toolbox allowing for the detection and labelling\nof recorded sound events, and to build an automatic classifier to sort any new\nacoustic data into known classes. It is made up of three\nmodules handling Detection, Labelling and Classification and running on either Linux or Windows.
