[u'A photographic method for estimating chlorophyll in periphyton on artificial substrata', ['Leonardo Saravia', 'Adonis Giorgi', 'Fernando Momo'], u'2016-10-29T19:07:40Z', u'The collection of time-series of periphyton biomass is a difficult task due to the destructive nature of the standard methods. A non-destructive method based on photography and digitalization, for the estimation of Chla of periphyton colonizing artificial substrata is presented. The standard spectrophotometric method was used to obtain a calibration curve. The relative errors of the proposed method were similar to those of other published methods. The photographic method should be used when a large quantity of samples from the same community is needed and a high precision on the individual measurement is not required.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/A_photographic_method_for_estimating_chlorophyll_in_periphyton_on_artificial_substrata/4128834', [u'Freshwater Ecology'], []]
