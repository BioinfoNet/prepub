[u'Perception of Global Image Contrast is Predicted by Matched Filtering and the Integration and Suppression of Local Contrasts (not RMS contrast)', ['Daniel Baker'], u'2016-05-20T14:51:15Z', u'Raw data from a study by Meese, Baker & Summers entitled: "Perception of Global Image Contrast is Predicted by Matched Filtering and the Integration and Suppression of Local Contrasts (not RMS contrast)". The stimuli were textures comprising small patches of grating of different contrasts, and the task was one of contrast matching.
