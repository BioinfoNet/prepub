[u'ICE Card-support of the emergency services on accident site', ['Goniewicz Mariusz', 'Krzysztof Goniewicz', 'Sak Jarosaw', 'Chemperek Ewa', 'Rafa Patryn'], u'2016-10-15T15:07:27Z', u'Emergency medical services, police, firefighters and all others who provide first aid on-site emergency many times have hardness when they have to inform family or people related with victims. Some years ago italian medical rescuers suggest to mark some number in mobile phone in a special way to make contact with family easier. In the opinions of the Italian rescuers the best way to mark this number is to name it I.C.E. (In Case of Emergency). This kind of mark would make job of medical rescuers easier. More than one number in mobile phone should be called ICE1, ICE2,ICE3, etc. ICE begin in 2005 along the world. Its common in England, Italy, German. In Poland is popular from this year. I.C.E. is promoted by Polish Red Cros', u'https://figshare.com/articles/ICE_Card_support_of_the_emergency_services_on_accident_site/686127', [u'Medicine'], []]
[u'Roads accidents as one of the major threats for the health of the contemporary human', ['Mariusz Goniewicz', 'Krzysztof Goniewicz', 'Katarzyna Zielonka'], u'2016-10-15T15:07:11Z', u'Road accidents are a serious problem of the modern world. They are one of the main causes of injuries and are the third most frequent cause of death. Every year, about one million people, adults and children, die on the roads and several millions get injured. Mortality rate due to injuries from road accidents amounts to 2.2% of all deaths in the world. The research presents epidemiology of road accidents in the period 1990- 2009 with particular emphasis on the key issues of road safety in Poland, related to the dangerous behaviour of road users (disregard toward traffic rules). Between years 1990 and 2009 on Polish roads took place more than a million sixty one thousand accidents with 126 000 fatalities and over 1 336 thousand casualties. Despite the various measures which are taken to improve safety on Polish roads, the number of dead and wounded in the vehicle mishap is still large, and losses borne by society are high. To improve safety on Polish roads, it is necessary to continue multi- action plan to systematically progress in the level of road safety.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Roads_accidents_as_one_of_the_major_threats_for_the_health_of_the_contemporary_human/652967', [u'Medicine'], []]
[u'Health and live risk of children in traffic accidents', ['Mariusz Goniewicz', 'Krzysztof Goniewicz', 'Renata Domza-Drzewicka', 'Rafa Patryn', 'Katarzyna Muzyczka'], u'2016-10-15T15:06:53Z', u'All kinds of injuries resulted by road accidents are the most common cause of death among children, more common than cancer and birth defects. In Poland in the years 1995-2009 happened 113.959 accidents involving children in age of 0-14 years. The 3.791 children died, and 117.730 were injured. Most fatalities were recorded among children between age 7-14 years. The research presents the main problems of road safety and the nature of the causes and consequences of accidents among children in Poland. Children injuries are one of the biggest problems in modern medicine that requires vigorous and preventive actions. Children of all ages should be intensively covered by the educational activities related to road safety. Raise awareness of the risks associated with participation of children in traffic to the parents and carers can greatly reduce the number of accidents.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Health_and_live_risk_of_children_in_traffic_accidents/652968', [u'Medicine'], []]
