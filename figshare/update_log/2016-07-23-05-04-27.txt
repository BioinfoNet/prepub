[u'Exploration is dependent on reproductive state, not social state', ['Hannah A Edwards', 'Hannah L Dugdale', 'David S Richardson', 'Jan Komdeur', 'Terry Burke'], u'2016-07-22T09:18:16Z', u'Personality\nis an intriguing phenomenon in populations because it constrains behavioural\nflexibility. One theory suggests that personality could be generated and\nmaintained if dependent on asset protection. It is predicted that trade\u2013offs\nwith fitness expectations and survival probability encourage consistent\nbehavioural differences among individuals (personality). Although not mutually\nexclusive, the social niche specialisation hypothesis suggests that a group of\nindividuals that repeatedly interact will develop personality to avoid costly\nsocial conflict. The point at which behavioural consistency originates in the\nsocial niche hypothesis is still unclear, with predictions for development\nafter a change in social status. In the facultative\ncooperatively breeding Seychelles warbler (Acrocephalus\nsechellensis), residing on Cousin Island, breeding vacancies are limited and\nthis forces individuals into different social roles. We used this system to\ntest whether reproductive and social state predicted among\u2013individual\ndifferences in exploration. We had two predictions. Firstly, that an individual\u2019s start in life can predict personality,\nwhereby young individuals with a good start to life (associated\nwith early age reproduction and earlier onset survival senescence) are fast\nexplorers, suggesting reproductive state\u2013dependence.\nSecondly, that an individual\u2019s social status can\npredict personality, whereby dominant\nindividuals will be fast explorers suggesting that the behaviour is social\nstate\u2013dependent. Neither of the\nbehaviours were associated with social state and social state did not affect behavioural\nconsistency. However, novel object exploration was associated with a proxy of reproductive\nstate. Our results provide further support for state being a mechanism for\ngenerating individual differences in behaviour.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Exploration_is_dependent_on_reproductive_state_not_social_state/3470747', [u'Behavioural Ecology'], []]
