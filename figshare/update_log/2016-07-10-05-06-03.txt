[u'Cu(II) Reduction without Reductants: Insights from Theory', ['gloria tabacchi', 'Fois Ettore', 'Barreca Davide', 'Gasparotto Alberto', 'Chiara Maccato', 'Roberta Seraglia', 'Eugenio Tondello'], u'2016-07-09T16:58:50Z', u'A topic issue in sustainable technologies is the\nproduction of CuxO (x=1,2) nanomaterials\nwith tailored composition and properties. They can be fabricated through\nbottom-up processes that involve unexpected changes in the metal oxidation\nstate and open intriguing challenges on the copper redox chemistry. How Cu(II)\ncomplexes can lead to Cu(I) species in spite of the absence of any\nexplicit reducing agent is a question only recently answered by investigating\nthe fragmentation of a Cu(II) precursor for Cu oxide nanostructures\nby computer simulations and ESI-MS with multiple collisional experiments\n(ESI/MSn). Here we show that a Cu-promoted CH bond activation leads to reduction of the metal\ncenter and formation of a CuI-C-NCCN six-membered ring. Such 6-ring moiety is the\nstructural motif for a new family of cyclic Cu(I) adducts, characterized\nby a bonding scheme that may shed unprecedented light on high-temperature Cu\nchemistry. In particular, in this contribution we describe how collisions with\nhot atoms may activate Cu(II) species to a configuration prone to\nthe reduction. Besides its relevance for the fabrication of Cu-oxide\nnanostructures, the hydrogen-abstraction/proton-delivery/electron-gain\nmechanism of Cu(II) reduction described herein could be a general\nproperty of copper and might help to understand its redox reactivity.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Cu_II_Reduction_without_Reductants_Insights_from_Theory/3475451', [u'Analytical Chemistry', u'Analytical Spectrometry', u'Catalysis and Mechanisms of Reactions', u'Chemical Characterisation of Materials', u'Chemical Sciences', u'Chemical Thermodynamics and Energetics', u'Computational Chemistry', u'Free Radical Chemistry', u'Inorganic Chemistry', u'Inorganic Chemistry', u'Molecular Physics', u'Nanochemistry and Supramolecular Chemistry', u'Organic Chemistry', u'Organic Chemistry', u'Physical Chemistry', u'Physical Chemistry of Materials', u'Physical Organic Chemistry', u'Quantum Chemistry', u'Reaction Kinetics and Dynamics', u'Theoretical and Computational Chemistry', u'Theory and Design of Materials', u'Transition Metal Chemistry', u'Nanomaterials', u'Nanotechnology', u'Nanofabrication, Growth and Self Assembly'], []]
