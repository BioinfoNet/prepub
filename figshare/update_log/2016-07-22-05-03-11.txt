[u'data.zip', ['Ming Fang'], u'2016-07-22T03:04:43Z', u'The diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella,\xa0is one of the most important\xa0pests of cruciferous\xa0crops. We have earlier shown that N6-(2-hydroxyethyl)-adenosine (HEA) exhibits insecticidal activity against P. xylostella.\xa0In the present study we investigated the possible mechanism of insecticidal action of HEA on P. xylostella. HEA is a derivative of adenosine, therefore, we speculated whether it acts via P. xylostella\xa0adenosine receptor (PxAdoR). We used RNAi approach to silence PxAdoR\xa0gene and used antagonist of denosine receptor (AdoR)\xa0to study the insecticidal effect of HEA. We cloned the\xa0whole sequence of PxAdoR\xa0gene. A BLAST search using NCBI protein database showed a\xa061% identity with the\xa0Drosophila\xa0adenosine receptor (DmAdoR)\xa0and\xa0a 32-35% identity with\xa0human\xa0AdoR.\xa0Though\xa0the amino acids\xa0sequence of PxAdoR was different\xa0compared to\xa0other adenosine receptors,\xa0most of the amino acids that are known to be important for adenosine receptor ligand binding and signaling were present, But only 30% binding sites key residues was similar between PxAdoR and A1R. HEA, at a dose of 1 mg/mL,\xa0was found to be\xa0lethal to the\xa0second-instar larvae\xa0of\xa0P. xylostella,\xa0and\xa0a\xa0significant reduction of mortality and growth inhibition ratio\xa0were obtained\xa0when HEA was administered to the larvae along with\xa0PxAdoR-dsRNA\xa0or antagonist of AdoR (SCH58261) for\xa036,\xa048,\xa0or 60 h. Especially at 48\xa0h, the rate of growth inhibition\xa0of\xa0the\xa0PxAdoR knockdown group was 3.5-fold less\xa0than\xa0that of the HEA group,\xa0and the corrected mortality of SCH58261 group was reduced almost 2-fold compared with the HEA group.\xa0Our findings show that HEA may exert its insecticidal activity against P. xylostella\xa0larvae via acting on PxAdoR.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/data_zip/3494744', [u'Bioinformatics'], []]
