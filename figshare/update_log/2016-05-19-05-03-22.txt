[u'DMSA', ['Amy Winfiled'], u'2016-05-18T07:57:11Z', u'Metal chelation therapy is the most effective ways for the treatment of metal intoxication. Meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) is a derivative of dimercaprol. It is also named Succimer. It contains two sulfhydryl (\u2013SH) groups and has been shown to be the effective chelator of some toxic metals. The major advantages of DMSA include water-solubility, low toxicity, orally-administrable, and no redistribution of the metal from one organ to another.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/DMSA/3384121', [u'Biochemistry', u'Bioinorganic Chemistry', u'Biologically Active Molecules', u'Biomolecular Modelling and Design', u'Immunological and Bioassay Methods', u'Geochemistry', u'Instrumental Methods (excl.
