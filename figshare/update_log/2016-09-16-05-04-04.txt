Students were placed in five groups- two groups of five\nand three groups of four. The lab group I was working with consisted of four\nmembers and each member surveyed one lab group (not including our own) and\nshared data.\xa0 Measurements were\ncategorical because gender and hair colour are measure in categories. Students\nin the lab were surveyed by other students and two questions were ask 1) what\nis your gender; 2) What is your hair colour, students wrote down what answers\nwere given. Students were allotted fifteen minutes to survey and collect data for\nour lab section. This was done as a trial to allow the students to familiarize\nthemselves with Figshare, to better understand the difference between data and\nmeta-data, and to help students improve for future assignments.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Introduction_to_Ecology_A_Study_on_Hair_and_Gender/3833172', [u'Community Ecology (excl.
