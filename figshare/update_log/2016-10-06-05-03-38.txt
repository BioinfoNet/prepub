[u'Predator diversity and bromeliad communities: experimental results', ['Andrew MacDonald', 'Diane Srivastava', 'Gustavo Romero'], u'2016-10-05T13:24:54Z', u'We tested effects of both single and multiple predator species on community responses with a manipulative experiment where identical prey communities were exposed to treatments of either a single predator, or pairs of predators representing increasing phylogenetic diversity. In this experiment we focused on the four most abundant large predators found inthe community: Leptagrion andromache and Leptagrion elongatum (Odonata:Coenagrionidae), a predatory Tabanid fly (Diptera:Tabanidae:Stibasoma sp.) anda predatory leech. We combined these species in eight treatments: predator-freecontrol (no predators), each of the four predator species alone (3a) andpairs of predator species chosen to maximize variation in phylogenetic distance(3b). Specifically, these pairs were: two congeneric damselflies(Leptagrion andromache and Leptagrion elongatum), two insects (L.elongatum and Stibasoma), and two invertebrates (L. elongatumand a predatory leech).  We used five replicate bromeliads for each of these 8treatments (8 treatments, n=5). This experiment, therefore, allows the estimationof the effect of each predator species (single-species treatments), as well as thedetection of non-additive effects in predator combinations.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Predator_diversity_and_bromeliad_communities_experimental_results/3983964', [u'Freshwater Ecology', u'Community Ecology (excl.
