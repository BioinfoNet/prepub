We recorded the occurrence of back and/or flank\ndisplays and time invested in flank display. Due to the uniformly short\nduration of back displays (<3 s), we did not measure duration for this\ntrait.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Male_and_female_courtship_signals_constitute_local_dialects_in_red-eyed_treefrogs/3581481', [u'Animal Behaviour', u'Evolutionary Biology'], []]
