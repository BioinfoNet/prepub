[u'Bacterial 16S sequences from aerosol samples of Zero Carbon Building in Hong Kong', ['Marcus Leung', 'Jimmy C. K. Tong', 'Patrick K. H. Lee'], u'2016-12-27T21:27:20Z', u'Currently, there is no information pertaining to\nthe airborne bacterial communities (microbiota) of green buildings. In this\nstudy, the air bacterial community of a zero-carbon building (ZCB) in Hong Kong\nis characterized by targeting the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. Bacteria associated\nwith the outdoor environment and occupant skin dominate the indoor air\nmicrobiota. Differences in overall community diversity, membership, and\ncomposition associated with short (day-to-day) and long-term temporal\nproperties are detected, which may be driven by specific environmental genera\nand taxa. Furthermore, time-decay relationships in community membership (based\non unweighted UniFrac distances) and composition (based on weighed UniFrac\ndistances) differ depending on the season and sampling location. A Bayesian\nsource-tracking approach further supports the importance of adjacent outdoor air\nmicrobiota in sourcing the ZCB indoor microbiota. Despite the unique building\nattributes, the ZCB microbiota detected and its temporal characteristics are\nnot dissimilar to that of built environments investigated previously. In the\nfuture, controlled experiments and microbiota investigations of other ZCB will\nundoubtedly uncover additional knowledge related to how microbiomes in green\nbuildings are influenced by their distinctive architectural attributes.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Bacterial_16S_sequences_from_aerosol_samples_of_Zero_Carbon_Building_in_Hong_Kong/1433906', [u'Environmental Science', u'Microbiology'], []]
