[u'MicroRNA binding motifs identification methods', ['Wenfa Ng'], u'2015-09-17T05:55:05Z', u'Identification of microRNA (miRNA) target recognition and binding motifs (miRNA response elements, MRE) is a major unsolved problem in non-coding RNA (ncRNA) research, given its myriad and important implications in post-transcriptional gene regulation and, by extension, physiological effects. While evolution is a central theme permeating biology, attempts at identifying a conserved canonical binding sequence between miRNA and mRNA targets reveal that a variety of non-canonical interactions likely dominate those dependent on a defined \u201cseed\u201d sequence in the 5\u2019 end of miRNA. Such non-canonical interactions include bulges, G:U wobbles and even seedless interactions, and could occur in the 5\u2019 untranslated region (UTR), 3\u2019 UTR, promoter and even coding DNA sequence (CDS). Experimental techniques for isolating miRNA-mRNA interactions, and determination of binding sequence, typically involves the formation of the Agonaute protein-dependent RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), followed by crosslinking, antibody-mediated pulldown, RNase and proteinase digestion, and finally, readout by next-generation short-read sequencing. Nevertheless, computational structural and energetics studies are critical for deducing the miRNA binding motif from sequenced reads. The slides presented here summarize several contemporary approaches for characterizing miRNA-target interactions, and elucidating binding motifs from the experimental and computational perspectives. Crosslinking and immunoprecipitation approaches include (High throughput sequencing of isolates from crosslinking and immunoprecipitation, HITS-CLIP), (Crosslinking and immunoprecipitation-sequencing, CLIP-Seq), (Photoactivable ribonucleoside enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation, PAR-CLIP), and (Crosslinking, ligation and sequencing of hybrids, CLASH), while computational algorithms featured are miRanda and TargetScan. Key features of each technique are provided, and the slides should be useful from the educational viewpoint, in introducing students to miRNA-mRNA heteroduplex isolation and binding sequence identification methods in either a molecular biology or life sciences techniques course.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/MicroRNA_binding_motifs_identification_methods/1373962', [u'Molecular Biology', u'Education'], []]

However, the genomic background and the different timing of action (in the presence of either early or late mechanisms of germ line specification) can influence the outcome of the segregation mechanism.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Mitochondrial_membrane_potential_a_trait_involved_in_organelle_inheritance_/3420583', [u'Evolutionary Biology', u'Developmental Biology'], []]
