[u"Women's preferences for penis size: A new research method using selection among 3D models", ['Nicole Prause', 'Jaymie Park', 'Shannon Leung', 'Geoffrey Miller'], u'2017-01-09T21:47:59Z', u'Women\u2019s preferences for penis size may affect men\u2019s comfort with their own bodies and may have implications for sexual health. Studies of women\u2019s penis size preferences typically have relied on their abstract ratings or selecting amongst 2D, flaccid images. This study used haptic stimuli to allow assessment of women\u2019s size recall accuracy for the first time, as well as examine their preferences for erect penis sizes in different relationship contexts. Women (N = 75) selected amongst 33, 3D models. Women recalled model size accurately using this method, although they made more errors with respect to penis length than circumference. Women preferred a penis of slightly larger circumference and length for one-time (length = 6.4 inches/16.3 cm, circumference = 5.0 inches/12.7 cm) versus long-term (length = 6.3 inches/16.0 cm, circumference = 4.8 inches/12.2 cm) sexual partners. These first estimates of erect penis size preferences using 3D models suggest women accurately recall size and prefer penises only slightly larger than average.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Women_s_preferences_for_penis_size_A_new_research_method_using_selection_among_3D_models/1466782', [u'Personality, Social and Criminal Psychology', u'Applied Psychology', u'Gender studies', u'Anatomy'], []]
