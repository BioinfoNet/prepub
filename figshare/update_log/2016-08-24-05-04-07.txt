[u'The EPA Online Prediction Physicochemical Prediction Platform to Support Environmental Scientists', ['Antony Williams'], u'2016-08-23T22:36:12Z', u'As part of our efforts to develop a public platform to\nprovide access to predictive models we have attempted to disentangle the\ninfluence of the quality versus quantity of data available to develop and\nvalidate QSAR models.\xa0 Using a thorough\nmanual review of the data underlying the well-known EPI Suite software, we\ndeveloped automated processes for the validation of the data using a KNIME\nworkflow. This includes: approaches to validate different chemical structure\nrepresentations (e.g. molfile and SMILES), identifiers (chemical names and\nregistry numbers), and methods to standardize the data into QSAR-consumable\nformats for modeling. Our efforts to quantify and segregate data into various\nquality categories has allowed us to thoroughly investigate the resulting\nmodels developed from these data slices, as well as allowing us to examine\nwhether or not efforts into the development of large high-quality datasets has\nthe expected pay-off in terms of prediction performance. Machine-learning\napproaches have been applied to create a series of models that have been used\nto generate predicted physicochemical and environmental parameters for over\n700,000 chemicals. These data are available online via the EPA\u2019s iCSS Chemistry\nDashboard.

[u'Structure Identification Using High Resolution Mass Spectrometry Data and the EPA\u2019s Chemistry Dashboard', ['Antony Williams'], u'2016-08-23T22:23:13Z', u'The iCSS Chemistry Dashboard is a publicly accessible\ndashboard provided by the National Center for Computation Toxicology at the\nUS-EPA. It serves a number of purposes, including providing a chemistry\ndatabase underpinning many of our public-facing projects (e.g. ToxCast and\nExpoCast). The available data and searches provide a valuable path to structure\nidentification using mass spectrometry as the source data. With an underlying\ndatabase of over 720,000 chemicals, the dashboard has already been used to assist\nin identifying chemicals present in house dust. However, it can also be applied\nto many other purposes, e.g., the identification of agrochemicals in waste\nstreams. This presentation will provide a review of the EPA\u2019s platform and\nunderlying algorithms used for the purpose of compound identification using\nhigh-resolution mass spectrometry data. We will also discuss progress towards a\nhigh-throughput non-targeted analysis platform for use by the mass spectrometry\ncommunity.\xa0 This abstract does not\nreflect U.S. EPA policy.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Structure_Identification_Using_High_Resolution_Mass_Spectrometry_Data_and_the_EPA_s_Chemistry_Dashboard/3753327', [u'Environmental Chemistry (incl.
