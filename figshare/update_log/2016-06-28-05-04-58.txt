[u'Large-Scale Approaches in the Quaternary: New Approaches, New Insights', ['John Williams'], u'2016-06-27T23:09:59Z', u'The Quaternary offers multiple advantages for biogeographers\nand global change ecologists interested in understanding the climatic and\nbiotic processes governing species distributions, community assembly, and species\npersistence (or extinction) during periods of large environmental change.\xa0 Climate changes were large, repeated, and\nabrupt, with regional rates of change similar to those projected for the 21st\ncentury.\xa0 Shifts in insolation and\ntemperature seasonality produced climates with no modern analog.\xa0 There is a long tradition of data-model\ncomparisons in paleoclimatology, with paleoclimatic proxies used as benchmarks\nfor earth system models, to put recent climate changes into context, and to\nunderstand the natural and anthropogenic drivers of climate variations.\xa0 A new wave of data-model comparisons has\nemerged over the past decade, primarily focused on testing biogeographic theory\nand assessing and improving the predictive ability of ecological forecasting\nmodels.\xa0 This new wave is driven by three\nmain factors:\xa0 1) The development of\npaleoclimate model simulations and independent paleoclimatic proxies, which\nallows paleoecological data to serve as signals of ecological response rather\nthan as direct paleoclimate proxies, which has traditionally been the case.\xa0 2) The on-going assembly of paleoecological\ndata into well-organized and community-curated data resources such as the\nNeotoma Paleoecology Database (www.neotomadb.org),\nenabling continental-scale multi-proxy syntheses.\xa0 3) The increasing urgency to assess the\nexposure and sensitivity of species to 21st-century climate change\nand develop robust science-based adaptation strategies.\xa0 Examples of continental-scale syntheses of\nfossil pollen data and their application to test key biogeographic hypotheses include\nunderstanding the velocity of species distribution shifts during rapid climate\nchange, the stability of species-climate relationships, and whether we can\nsubstitute space for time when building biodiversity models.\xa0 The development of Bayesian statistical\nmodels that incorporate multiple sources of temporal and proxy uncertainty are\nenabling more comprehensive and more robust inference.\xa0 This in turn is opening the door to new kinds\nof data-model assimilation and collaborations with terrestrial ecosystem\nmodelers, in which paleoecological data can be used to initialize, validate,\nand improve ecosystem models.\xa0\nAdditionally, the growth and growing availability of archaeological\ndatabases offer the opportunity for new integrated assessments of the\ninteractions among climate, terrestrial ecosystems, and human land use and land\ncover change.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Large-Scale_Approaches_in_the_Quaternary_New_Approaches_New_Insights/3175546', [u'Paleontology', u'Paleoclimatology', u'Ecological Impacts of Climate Change', u'Terrestrial Ecology'], []]

This allowed each to cross-validate the other\u2019s work and improve the accuracy and efficiency of data extraction. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion between the pair. A third party reviewer (M.V.) was available for further adjudication, but was not needed. We extracted the following items from the published randomized controlled trials: primary outcome(s), secondary outcome(s), date of subject enrollment, trial registry database and registration number, timing of assessment in primary outcomes (ex.change in weight at 5 months, change in HbA1c at 6 weeks), sample size, any discrepancies between publication and registry disclosed by the author in the publication, and funding source. For the purpose of our study we classified funding source into the following categories: (1) private (ex. Mayo Clinic or philanthropic), (2) public (government or university), (3) industry/corporate (ex. GlaxoSmithKline), (4) University Hospital, (5) mixed funding source, or (6) undisclosed funding source. For RCTs which reported multiple primary and secondary outcomes, we recorded each explicitly stated outcome. If a primary outcome was not explicitly stated as such in the publication, the outcome stated in the sample size estimation was used. If none was explicitly stated in the text or in the sample size calculation, the article was excluded from the study. When sample size was not explicitly stated in the article, we used the \u201cnumber randomized\u201d. If author\u2019s failed to differentiate between primary and secondary outcomes in the publication, these non-delineated outcomes were coded as \u201cunable to assess\u201d and excluded from comparison.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/SRDR_Master_list_published_and_registered_xlsx/3464336', [u'Endocrinology', u'Cardiology (incl.
