Mostly, men between 20 and 40 years of age are affected. In general, patients suffering from GCCs are treated by orchiectomy and radio- or chemotherapy. Due to resistance mechanisms, intolerance to the therapy or denial of chemo- / radiotherapy by the patients, GCCs are still a lethal threat, highlighting the need for alternative treatment strategies.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/A_signaling_cascade_including_ARID1A_GADD45B_and_DUSP1_induces_apoptosis_and_affects_the_cell_cycle_of_germ_cell_cancers_after_romidepsin_treatment/3798471', [u'Cancer Therapy (excl.
