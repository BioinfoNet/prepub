COHMAP was\nrevolutionary with respect to both its scientific discoveries (Milankovitch\ncontrol of subtropical monsoons and high-latitude climate dynamics) and its\nestablishment of large, coordinated teams of scientists, working across many facets\nof the earth system. The many children of COHMAP include the NOAA National\nCenter for Environmental Informatics (Paleoclimatology), BIOME 6000, the\nPaleoclimate Modeling Intercomparison Project, PAGES 2k, the Neotoma\nPaleoecology Database, and the Paleoecological Observatory Network (PalEON).', u'https://figshare.com/articles/GSA2016B_Community-Curated_Data_Resources_and_Large-Scale_Data-Model_Syntheses_The_Children_of_COHMAP/3971511', [u'Palaeoecology', u'Community Ecology (excl.

[u'GSA2016A: Turning back the clock: Reconstructions of historical forest composition, stem density, and biomass using Public Land Survey, fossil pollen data, and STEPPS', ['John Williams', 'Andria Dawson', 'Simon Goring', 'Chris Paciorek', 'Jason McLachlan', 'Steve Jackson'], u'2016-09-29T14:12:44Z', u'North American forests have been\ntransformed by human action, challenging both paleoecologists and global change\necologists who use contemporary ecosystems as a baseline for past or future\ninferences.\xa0 As part of the\nPaleoecological Observatory Network (PalEON) project, we present new gridded\n(8x8km) reconstructions of historic forest composition, stem density, and\nbiomass for 28 tree taxa in northern US forests for the pre-settlement era (ca.\n1700 to 1890 CE), based on Public Land Survey (PLS) data.\xa0 These\nPLS-based reconstructions include multiple corrections for potential surveyor\nbiases, including spatially varying correction factors to accommodate sampling\ndesign, azimuthal censoring, and biases in tree selection.\xa0 We employ these pre-settlement vegetation\nreconstructions, in combination with networks of fossil pollen records drawn\nfrom the Neotoma Paleoecology Database (www.neotomadb.org),\nto calibrate the STEPPS pollen-vegetation model and reconstruct forest\ncomposition in the northern US over the last two millennia.\xa0 STEPPS, as a\nhierarchical Bayesian model, includes estimates of uncertainty in parameter\nestimation and state variable reconstruction.\xa0\nWe apply the pre-settlement datasets to map the distributions of lost forests (pre-settlement forests\nwith no current analog) and novel forests (modern forests with no past\nanalogs). We demonstrate shifts in tree-climate relationships over\nthe last two centuries due to historic land use and climate change.\xa0 \xa0The\nnext stage of work is to use these paleovegetation reconstructions to\ninitialize, validate, and improve the simulations of terrestrial ecosystem\nmodels; this work is underway.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/GSA2016A_Turning_back_the_clock_Reconstructions_of_historical_forest_composition_stem_density_and_biomass_using_Public_Land_Survey_fossil_pollen_data_and_STEPPS/3969360', [u'Palaeoecology'], []]
