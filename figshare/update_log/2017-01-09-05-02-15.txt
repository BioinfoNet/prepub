[u'Slides from DI4R conference: Emerging trends in Meta-Analysis with the increased availability of datasets \u2013 an example from Ecological sciences', ['Antica  Culina'], u'2017-01-08T11:10:11Z', u'Meta-analysis is traditionally conducted using the set\nof published (primary) studies. As such, it suffers from the publication bias\nand relies on the quality of primary studies. Open Science is increasing the\nnumber of datasets available to incorporate into meta-analysis, either to\nverify (or supplement) the results of primary studies, or to use the datasets\nas data-points in the analysis. I discuss the general case of the potential\nbenefits of Open Science to Meta-analysis and the possible formal procedures to\nevaluate these benefits. I then specifically focus on the position of\necological sciences - I describe the current data landscape and highlight the\nmain challenges that researcher face when navigating this landscape. Overcoming\nthese challenges largely depends on the developments of infrastructure for\nstoring, finding, and connecting scientific information, as well as on the\ntransition to FAIR data.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Emerging_trends_in_Meta-Analysis_with_the_increased_availability_of_datasets_an_example_from_Ecological_sciencespen/4529708', [u'Population, Ecological and Evolutionary Genetics'], []]
