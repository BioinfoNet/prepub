[u'Genetic structure of seagrasses from the western Gulf of Mexico', ['Patrick Larkin', 'Tabitha Maloney', 'Sebastian Rubiano-Rincon', 'Michael Barrett'], u'2016-05-25T00:03:02Z', u'Seagrasses serve as important ecosystem\nstructuring agents in coastal regions worldwide. We used a suite of\nmicrosatellite markers to study genetic diversity and structure in the seagrass\nHalodule wrightii L. Ascherson from\nthe western Gulf of Mexico. We examined seagrass beds from 10 sites (N = 464) that spanned H. wrightii\u2019s range on the Texas coast.\nCompared to other seagrass species we found that H. wrightii exhibits lower\nmean clonal diversity (R = 0.26), moderate allelic richness (AR = 4.5), high heterozygosity (He = 0.59), and low inbreeding (FIS = -0.05). Genetic structure along the Texas coast was\nsubtle, and appears to correlate with the limits of tidal movement in the\nLaguna Madre system.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Genetic_structure_of_seagrasses_from_the_western_Gulf_of_Mexico/3398362', [u'Population, Ecological and Evolutionary Genetics'], []]
