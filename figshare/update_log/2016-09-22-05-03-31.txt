[u'Delivering The Benefits of Chemical-Biological Integration in Computational Toxicology at the EPA', ['Antony Williams'], u'2016-09-22T03:18:33Z', u'Researchers at the EPA\u2019s National Center for Computational\nToxicology integrate advances in biology, chemistry, and computer science to\nexamine the toxicity of chemicals and help prioritize chemicals for further\nresearch based on potential human health risks. The intention of this research\nprogram is to quickly evaluate thousands of chemicals for potential risk but\nwith much reduced cost relative to historical approaches. This work involves\ncomputational and data driven approaches including high-throughput screening,\nmodeling, text-mining and the integration of chemistry, exposure and biological\ndata. We have developed a number of databases and applications that are\ndelivering on the vision of developing a deeper understanding of chemicals and\ntheir effects on exposure and biological processes that are supporting a large\ncommunity of scientists in their research efforts. This presentation will\nprovide an overview of our work to bring together diverse large scale data from\nthe chemical and biological domains, our approaches to integrate and\ndisseminate these data, and the delivery of models supporting computational\ntoxicology.

[u"Data of Several Species of Trees Collected in York University's Woodlot", ['Abegail Dela Pena'], u'2016-09-21T23:58:10Z', u'The data obtained was from the woodlots of York University\nin Toronto. It was a forested area on the outskirts of the university and there\nwas a lot of green canopy. There were different species of trees were present\nfor observation and data recording. The data was collected in pairs, one person\nrecording the numbers and measurements, and the other using the tools in order\nto obtain the measurements. The tools used were transect measuring tapes and\nnormal measuring tapes. The data was collected from 10 arbitrary trees from the\nedge to the centre of the woodlot. Walking in a straight line, every tree\nencountered that was twice the data recorder\u2019s height was recorded. The\ndichotomous tree guide was used to compare and match the tree leaves according\nto its species. Data from the species of Sugar Maple, Red Oak, Black Cherry, Bass\nWood, Red Pine and White Spruce were collected. \xa0The following variables recorded were the\nspecies of the tree, the diameter of the trunk, the distance from the previous\ntree and the condition of the tree itself, using numbers 0,1,and 2. Each tree\nwas labelled one to ten in order to chronologically keep track of the data and\nrecordings.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Data_of_Several_Species_of_Trees_Collected_in_York_University_sWoodlot/3846759', [u'Plant Biology', u'Ecological Physiology', u'Botany', u'Ecology'], []]
