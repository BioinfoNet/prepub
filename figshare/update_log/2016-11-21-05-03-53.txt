[u'GRcalculator: an online tool for calculating and mining drug response data', ['Nicholas Clark', 'Marc Hafner', 'Michal Kouril', 'Jeremy Muhlich', 'Mario Niepel', 'Elizabeth Williams', 'Peter Sorger', 'Mario Medvedovic'], u'2016-11-21T04:11:43Z', u'Large-scale dose-response data and genomic datasets can be\ncombined to discover novel drug-response biomarkers. There exist numerous\nonline datasets of drug-response assays, but they are currently poorly\naccessible and their potential as a big data resource is limited due to lack of\naccess and connection. Furthermore, it has recently been found that drug-response\ndata often vary from one study to the next. A major reason for this variance is\nthat traditional metrics of drug sensitivity such as IC50, Emax, and AUC values\nare confounded by the number of cell divisions taking place over the course of\nan assay. To solve this problem, we have developed GRcalculator, a suite of\nonline tools found at www.grcalculator.org.\xa0 The tools use GR metrics (proposed recently\nby Hafner et al. in Nature), a set of alterative drug-response metrics based on\ngrowth rate inhibition that are robust to differences in nominal division rate\nand assay duration.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/GRcalculator_an_online_tool_for_calculating_and_mining_drug_response_data/4244408', [u'Bioinformatics', u'Cancer', u'Pharmacology', u'Cell Development, Proliferation and Death'], []]

For example, LINCS includes large-scale transcriptional profiling of genetic and small molecule perturbations, and various proteomics and imaging datasets. The BD2K LINCS Data Coordination and Integration Center (DCIC) has been developing a collection of tools including data standards specifications, data processing pipelines and infrastructure, a metadata registration system, and a diverse suite of end-user software tools to support and implement an end-to-end solution from submitting LINCS datasets by the Data and Signature Generation Centers (DSGCs) to dataset publication via a Data Portal followed by integrated data analytics enabled by easy to use web-based tools. We will give an overview of LINCS tools with an emphasis on our long-term goal of persistent and FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) LINCS resources by connecting signatures, data processing pipelines, analytes, perturbagens, model systems and related concepts, and analysis software tools via uniquely identifiable digital research objects.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/FAIR_Dataset_Landing_Pages_Digital_Research_Objects_and_Software_Tools_for_LINCS_and_BD2K/4244216', [u'Computational  Biology', u'Cell Biology', u'Cancer', u'Genomics', u'Molecular Biology'], []]
