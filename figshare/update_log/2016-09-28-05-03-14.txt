[u'Multi-Isotopic (\u03b42H, \u03b413C, \u03b415N) Feather Isotopes for Red-winged Blackbirds Associated with Agro-ecosystems', ['Scott J. Werner', 'Keith A. Hobson', 'Steven L Van Wilgenburg', 'Justin W Fischer'], u'2016-09-27T22:02:18Z', u'We analyzed stable-hydrogen (\u03b42H), carbon (\u03b413C) and nitrogen (\u03b4 15N) isotope ratios in feathers to better understand the molt origin and food habits of Red-winged Blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) near sunflower production in the Upper Midwest and rice production in the Mid-South of the United States. Outer primary feathers grown on the breeding grounds were used from 661 after-second-year (ASY) male blackbirds collected in Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota (breeding collection), and Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri and Texas (winter collection).', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Multi-Isotopic_2H_13C_15N_Tracing_of_Molt_Origin_for_Red-winged_Blackbirds_Associated_with_Agro-ecosystems/3860772', [u'Population Ecology'], []]
