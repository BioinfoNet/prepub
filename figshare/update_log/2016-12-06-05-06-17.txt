In this study, we use Uyghurs, an ancient\nadmixed population to query the genetic bases why Europeans and Han Chinese\nlook different. Facial traits were analyzed based on high-dense 3D facial\nimages; numerous biometric spaces were examined for divergent facial features\nbetween European and Han Chinese, ranging from inter-landmark distances to\ndense shape geometrics. Genome-wide association analyses were conducted on a\ndiscovery panel of Uyghurs. Six significant loci were identified four of which,\nrs1868752, rs118078182, rs60159418 at or near UBASH3B, COL23A1, PCDH7 and rs17868256 were replicated in\nindependent cohorts of Uyghurs or Southern Han Chinese. A quantitative model was\ndeveloped to predict 3D faces based on 277 top GWAS SNPs. In hypothetic\nforensic scenarios, this model was found to significantly enhance the verification\nrate in males, suggesting a practical potential of related research.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Detecting_Genome-wide_Variants_of_Eurasian_Facial_Shape_Differentiation_DNA_based_Face_Prediction_Tested_in_Forensic_Scenario/4284770', [u'Genetics', u'Quantitative Genetics (incl.
