[u'Early ovariectomy unmasking the non-somatic origin of murine anti-A reactive IgM', ['Peter Arend'], u'2015-08-20T12:01:43Z', u'The germline encoding of a non-immune IgM molecule in\nmammals was experimentally documented for the first time by specifically timed\novariectomy of C57BL/10 mice. Although ovariectomy and castrations have been de\xadscribed\nto result in uncontrolled and/or enhanced humoral and cellular immunity,\ninvolving increasing weights of spleen and thymus with pronounced B and T cell\nproductions, the development of the mercaptoethanol-sensitive and\ncomplement-binding non-immune anti-A reactivity in murine plasma was not enhanced\nafter ovariectomy performed in C57BL/10 mice before the onset of puberty. In\nfact, this non-immune murine anti-A, which is complementary to trans-species immature,\nsyngeneic ovarian GalNAc-glycan-bearing, hydrophilic glycolipids and distinct\nfrom cross-reactive adaptive anti-A antibody, was strongly retarded or did not\nap\xadpear at all in plasmas of animals ovariectomized at the age of 20 days. Thus,\ncontrary to our previous views, this reactivity is unlikely to originate from a\nsomatic, primary immune or autoimmune response. Moreover, while all murine\ntissues expressed the expected, species-typical Forssman reactivity and further A-like structures were, by innate\nhuman anti-A antibody identified in male and female reproductive organs and\nendodermal tissues, the murine anti-A was exclusively inhibited by syngeneic\novarian glycolipids. Although the developmental\nrelationships involving primordial germ cells (PGCs), embryonic germ cells\n(ESCs) and lymphomyeloid cell lineages are not yet completely understood, the\nexplanation for these findings may reside in the topographically connected\nproduction of the trans-species-functional and germline-specific A-like GalNAc epitope and\nits complementary, ancestral IgM molecule in differentiating mammalian ovarian\ntissue.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Early_ovariectomy_unmasking_the_non_somatic_origin_of_murine_anti_A_reactive_IgM/1279394', [u'Microbiology', u'Hematology', u'Medicine', u'Biochemistry', u'Developmental Biology', u'Zoology', u'Systems Biology', u'Structural Biology', u'Stem Cells', u'Cell Biology', u'Genetics'], []]
