All patients with an AIDS-defining OI were included. In\npatients with more than one OI the first event reported was considered.\nCalendar trends in the proportion of patients in the EH group (before and after\n2009) were estimated by site and for the whole cohort. Factors associated with\nEH were estimated using multivariable logistic regression models.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/HAART_after_OI_report_txt/3365158', [u'Epidemiology'], []]

[u'Using bacteria as \u201cink\u201d for inscribing names on agar: A memento for students', ['Wenfa Ng'], u'2014-02-25T03:50:31Z', u'What are your most vivid memories of university? I think the life-long friendships fostered during undergraduate studies would come to mind for most graduates. Observing my students progressed from being strangers at the start of their final year research projects to friends at the end of the research experience, an idea came to my mind of creating a memento to help them recollect \u2013 in future - this particular moment in their lives, as well as the camaraderie and friendships fostered. Specifically, using a purple pigment secreting bacterium, the initials of the students\u2019 names were inscribed onto agar, whereupon growth of bacteria and secretion of pigment (similar to photo development in traditional film-based photography) made visible the pattern in a process closely resembling writing \u2013 but with bacteria cells serving as \u201cink.\u201d One name on an agar; photographs of individual agar plates and a \u201cfamily photo\u201d comprising all agar plates constituted the memento. The accompanying PDF file contains a more detailed abstract describing the technique, while the original article, \u201cBacterial Calligraphy: A Memento for Undergraduate Research Students,\u201d has been published in the Journal of Microbiology and Biology Education, Vol. 13, No. 2, pp. 172-174, and is available at http://jmbe.asm.org/index.php/jmbe/article/view/414 as an open-access article.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Using_bacteria_as_ink_to_inscribe_names_on_agar_A_memento_for_students/936961', [u'Education', u'Microbiology'], []]

While RNA-Seq fusion workflows exist detecting large structural changes from exome- and WGS data remains challenging. Current DNA-based SV callers predict a large percentage of false positive events, and the resulting event lists are not prioritised for validation. We introduce a workflow for detecting large SVs such as deletions, duplications, inversions, fusions and translocations from DNA re-sequencing techniques, annotating and prioritising for clinically actionable events.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Validated_structural_variant_detection_with_prioritisation_of_known_cancer_related_changes/3364615', [u'Genomics'], []]

Heterogenous tumor materials complicate variant assessment in low frequency subclonal populations, which can play an important role in the development of drug resistance. We demonstrate improvements in the specificity and sensitivity of a variant calling algorithm by optimising linear combinations of widely used filtering criteria such as allelic frequency, depth and p-value distributions.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Optimizing_the_detection_of_subclonal_somatic_variants_with_VarDict/3364609', [u'Genomics'], []]
