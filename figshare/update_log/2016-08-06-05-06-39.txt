[u'Olfaction in chicken: A neglected mode of social communication? Illustration of potential contexts', ['E. Tobias Krause'], u'2016-08-05T12:20:00Z', u'In our\npaper (Krause, Schrader, Caspers, 2016) we hypothesize that the role of social\nolfactory signals is likely to be important in numerous contexts in chicken (Gallus gallus). Potential contexts are\nschematically illustrated in the figure. a) Competition and aggression between\nmales might be mediated or inhibited by odours if body scent allows to assess\nthe competitors condition. b) Chickens are polygynous and the dominant male\nsires most offspring, thus mate quality might also be included in the chemical\nsignaling. a-i) Furthermore, it seems plausible that kin might be recognized on\nthe basis of scent, as known from other bird species. Moreover, also unfamiliar\nkin might also be detected based on the body scent. c) The status about\nrelatedness, actual breeding state, social status, health status between adult\nfemales may be perceived by olfactory cues. d,e,h) The scent of offspring and\nparents might mutually be learned already during incubation and/or after\nhatching and f,g) chicks might distinguish siblings from non-siblings by scent\nor learn their social odour template early in life. i) Group membership or j) the species may be\nrecognized.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Olfaction_in_chicken_A_neglected_mode_of_social_communication_Illustration_of_potential_contexts/3539354', [u'Animal Behaviour'], []]
