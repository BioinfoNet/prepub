[u'Do spatial patterns of temperate trees reflect shade tolerance?', ['Alissa Brown'], u'2016-08-14T13:50:04Z', u'Susceptibility\nof tree seedlings to herbivores and pathogens is a mechanism of the\nJanzen-Connell (J-C) effect, which predicts spatial over-dispersion of\nseedlings around established conspecifics. Counteracting the effects of\npathogens, mutualistic soil fungi are similarly expected to have spatially\nexplicit effects on seedling recruitment. It has been proposed that trees\nexhibit a life-history trade-off such that high growth rate is correlated with\nlow investment in tissue defense against plant enemies, and perhaps lower\nresponsiveness to soil mutualists. Thus, shade intolerant species should be\nmore vulnerable to herbivores and pathogens than shade tolerant species.\nBecause there exists both 1) spatial heterogeneity of plant enemies and\nmutualists and 2) differing tissue defense strategies among tree species, I\nexpect there to be species-specific differences in spatial patterns of tree\nrecruitment.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Do_spatial_patterns_of_temperate_trees_reflect_shade_tolerance_/3580710', [u'Terrestrial Ecology', u'Community Ecology (excl.
