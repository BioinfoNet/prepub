Low overlap between epitope predictions for primary vs. recurrent sample sets using \u201cconfident\u201d variants. Greater concordance between samples from the primary time point compared with later recurrences.Presented at:\xa013th Cancer Immunotherapy (CIMT) annual meeting 2015Authors: Alex Rubinsteyn, John Martignetti , Elena Pereira, Tim O'Donnell , Arun Ahuja , Leo Garnar-Wortzel , Robert Sebra , Peter Dottino , Jeff Hammerbacher , Eric Schadt", u'https://figshare.com/articles/Heterogeneity_of_mutated_tumor_antigens_in_a_single_high_grade_ovarian_serous_carcinoma/2333605', [u'Computational  Biology', u'Genomics', u'Cancer Genetics'], []]
[u'Impact of Location on Animal Abundance and Diversity', ['Arian  Nouraee', 'Setareh Rezvani'], u'2016-09-27T01:27:37Z', u'Method, pan trap data set: This experiment was conducted with\nSetareh Rezvani on a slightly rainy day with a climate of 16\xb0 at the grasslands\nand woodlots area at Saywell Woods at York University on Monday September 25,\n2016 at approximately 3:00 PM. 20 solo bowls were obtained, 10 of which were\nwhite, and the remaining 10 were blue. 5 blue bowls and 5 white bowls were\nplaced in the grassland; the white bowls were placed near areas with many\nflowers whereas the blue bowls were placed in areas with just grass. 5 blue\nbowls and 5 white bowls were placed in the woodlot; the white bowls were placed\nnear the trees whereas the blue bowls were placed away from the trees. All 20\nsolo bowls were filled with soapy water and were left for approximately 2.5\nhours. After 2.5 hours subsided, the number of animals and the number of rtus\n(recognizable taxonomic units) were obtained for each bowl.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Impact_of_Location_on_Animal_Abundance_and_Diversity/3859881', [u'Population Ecology'], []]
