[u'Sequencing a piece of history: complete genome sequence of the original Escherichia coli strain', ['Karl Dunne'], u'2016-11-16T22:47:09Z', u'In 1885 Theodor\nEscherich first described the Bacillus\ncoli commune, which was subsequently renamed Escherichia coli. We report the complete genome sequence of this\noriginal strain. The 5,144,392\nbp circular chromosome encodes genes for 4,805 proteins that include\nantigens, virulence factors, antimicrobial resistance factors and secretion\nsystems of a commensal organism from the pre-antibiotic era. Its phylogenetic\nlocation in the A subgroup, and close to E.\ncoli K-12, is consistent with Escherich\u2019s observations that E. coli NCTC 86 is a non-pathogenic\norganism that was part of the normal microbiota. E. coli strains NCTC 86 and the non-pathogenic K-12, C, B and HS\nstrains share a common back-bone that is largely co-linear. The exception is a\nlarge 2,803,932 bp inversion that spans the replication terminus from gmhB to clpB. Comparison with E. coli\nK-12 MG1655 revealed 41 regions of difference (577,351 bp) distributed across\nthe chromosome. For example and contrary to current dogma, E. coli NCTC 86 includes a 9-gene sil locus that encodes a silver resistance efflux pump acquired\nbefore the current widespread use of silver nanoparticles as an antibacterial agent,\npossibly resulting from the widespread use of silver utensils and currency in\nGermany in the 1800s. In summary, phylogenetic comparisons with other E. coli strains confirmed that the\noriginal strain isolated by Escherich is most closely related to the\nnon-pathogenic commensal strains. It is more distant from the root than the\npathogenic organisms E. coli 042 and\nO157:H7 and therefore it is not an ancestral state for the species.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Sequencing_a_piece_of_history_complete_genome_sequence_of_the_original_Escherichia_coli_strain/4235762', [u'Microbiology'], []]
