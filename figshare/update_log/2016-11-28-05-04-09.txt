These records represent 971 species, introduced to 230 countries and administrative areas across all eight biogeographical realms, spanning the period 6000 BCE \u2013 AD 2014. The data comprises taxonomic (species-level), spatial (geographic location, realm, land type) and temporal (dates of introduction and spread) components, as well as details relating to the introduction event (how and why the species was introduced, whether or not it is established). Each line of data consists of an individual record concerning a specific alien bird species introduced to a specific location. The data derives from both published and unpublished sources, including atlases, country species lists, peer-reviewed articles, websites and via correspondence with in-country experts.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Data_from_The_Global_Avian_Invasions_Atlas_-_A_database_of_alien_bird_distributions_worldwide/4234850', [u'Global Change Biology', u'Vertebrate Biology', u'Ecology', u'Conservation and Biodiversity', u'Invasive Species Ecology'], []]
