[u'Supplementary data associated with this article.rar', ['zhijun xie', 'Yongsheng fan', 'Jing Sun', 'Li Zhang', 'Yujun He', 'Kun Zhang', 'Liping Wu'], u'2016-06-12T00:27:00Z', u'Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is\nincreasingly getting clinical application worldwide. But its theory like\nQI-Blood is still abstract. Actually, Qi deficiency and blood deficiency, which\nwere treated by Si-Jun-Zi-Tang (SJZT) and Si-Wu-Tang (SWT) respectively, have characteristic\nclinical manifestations. Here, we analyzed targets of the ingredients in SJZT\nand SWT to unveil potential biologic mechanisms between Qi deficiency and blood\ndeficiency through biomedical approaches. First, ingredients in SWT and SJZT\nwere retrieved from TCMID database. The genes targeted by these ingredients\nwere chosen from STITCH. After enrichment analysis by Gene Ontology (GO) and DAVID,\nenriched GO terms with p-value less than 0.01 were collected and interpreted\nthrough DAVID and KEGG. Then a visualized network was constructed with ClueGO. Finally,\na total of 243 genes targeted by 195 ingredients of SWT formula and 209 genes\ntargeted by 61 ingredients of SJZT were obtained. Six\xa0metabolism pathways and two environmental information\nprocessing pathways\xa0enriched by targets were correlated with two or more\nherbs in SWT and SJZT formula, respectively. SWT significantly influence\namino acid and carbohydrate metabolism. While SJZT mainly influence the organismal\nsystem function, environmental information processing, metabolism and cellular\nprocesses.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Supplementary_data_associated_with_this_article_rar/3428108', [u'Traditional Chinese Medicine and Treatments'], []]
[u'Functionality of the spotted salamander egg mass polymorphism', ['Matthew Pintar'], u'2016-06-11T17:09:35Z', u'The spotted\nsalamander,\xa0Ambystoma\nmaculatum, exhibits a unique polymorphism in the structure and appearance\nof its egg masses. This polymorphism is genetically determined and is due to\nthe substitution of one protein in the outer jelly layer of egg masses. Based\non the observation that the proportion of white egg masses in ponds across its\nrange correlated with dissolved nutrient levels, we tested whether this\npolymorphism is advantageous to egg masses in ponds with different nutrient\nlevels using two mesocosm experiments and by collecting field data from natural\nponds at the University of Mississippi Field Station (UMFS). Larvae from white\negg masses were larger upon hatching in low nutrient conditions than those from\nclear egg masses, and these differences persisted throughout the larval period.\nHigher proportions of white egg masses were found in ponds with low\nconductivity (an indicator of dissolved nutrient levels) at UMFS. These results\nsupport the idea that polymorphisms can be adaptations to, and are maintained\nby, environmental heterogeneity.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Functionality_of_the_spotted_salamander_egg_mass_polymorphism/3427982', [u'Evolutionary Biology', u'Freshwater Ecology', u'Population Ecology'], []]
