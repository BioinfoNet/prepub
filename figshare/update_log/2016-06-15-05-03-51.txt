[u'The ecological genomics of gypsy moth invasion along a latitudinal gradient', ['Christopher Friedline'], u'2016-06-14T22:05:42Z', u'In this study, we used the North American invasion of the European gypsy moth as a model to examine the genomic architecture of life history traits in populations across the latitudinal extent of the invasive range. Using a GWAS approach to identify loci associated with phenotypic variation, we assessed the differentiation of populations along this extent in terms of biologically consequential traits. GWAS has strong inferential capabilities where we could use associated SNP data to estimate multi-locus parameters of heritability, FST, QST, and linkage disequilibrium.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/The_ecological_genomics_of_gypsy_moth_invasion_along_a_latitudinal_gradient/3437117', [u'Evolutionary Biology'], []]

Evan Johnson', 'Keith A. Crandall'], u'2016-06-14T16:38:50Z', u'Our understanding of the composition, function, and health implications of human microbiota has been advanced by high-throughput sequencing and the development of new genomic analyses. However, tradeoffs among alternative strategies for the acquisition and analysis of sequence data remain understudied. How do sequencing layout, sample complexity, and analysis pipeline affect taxonomic profiles? In order to approach this, we simulated metagenomic datasets reflecting different read lengths (75-1000 bp), sequencing depths (100 k-10 M), and number of species (10-426). Likewise, we simulated different database composition scenarios including presence/absence of dominant microbes in the database. The resulting simulation design yielded ~144 datasets analyzed using six pipelines (MetaPhlan2; metaMix, PathoScope2, Sigma, Kraken, and ConStrains).', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Evaluation_of_Computational_Methods_for_Human_Microbiome_Analysis_Using_Simulated_Data/3436784', [u'Bioinformatics', u'Computational  Biology', u'Microbial Ecology', u'Microbiology'], []]

[u'A minimal DNA 5-methylcytosine signature of oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma links altered methylation with tumor characteristics', ['Binay Panda'], u'2016-06-14T05:29:07Z', u'Oral\ntongue squamous cell carcinomas (OTSCC) are a homogenous group of\naggressive tumors in the head and neck region that spread\nearly to lymph nodes and have a higher incidence of regional failure.\nAdditionally, there is a rising incidence of oral tongue cancer among\nyounger population. Studies on functional DNA methylation changes\nlinked with altered gene expression are important towards\nunderstanding of tumor development and metastasis. Such studies may\nprovide insights into biomarkers linked with viral infection, tumor\nmetastasis and patient survival in OTSCC. We performed genome-wide\nmethylation analysis of tumors (N\n= 52) and correlated altered methylation with differential gene\nexpression. The minimal tumor-specific DNA methylation signature\nidentified genes near 16 different differentially methylated regions\n(DMRs), which were validated using data from the cancer genome atlas\n(TCGA) cohort. In our cohort, hypermethylation of the microRNA\nMiR-10B\nwas significantly associated with the differential expression of its\ntarget genes NR4A3\nand BCL2L11\n(P\n= 0.0125 and P\n= 0.014 respectively), which was inversely correlated with\ndisease-free survival (P\n= 9E-15 and P\n=\n2E-15 respectively) in patients. We found differential methylation in\nFUT3,\nTRIM5,\nTSPAN7,\nMAP3K8,\nRPS6KA2,\nSLC9A9 and\nNPAS3\ngenes to be predictive of certain clinical and epidemiological\nparameters.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/A_minimal_DNA_5-methylcytosine_signature_of_oral_tongue_squamous_cell_carcinoma_links_altered_methylation_with_tumor_characteristics/3382966', [u'Cancer'], []]
