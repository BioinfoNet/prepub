[u'DCE-MRI-Derived Parameters in Evaluating Abraxane-Induced Early Vascular Response and the Effectiveness of Its Synergistic Interaction with Cisplatin', ['Xilin Sun'], u'2016-09-06T20:33:16Z', u'Our previous studies revealed molecular alterations of\ntumor vessels, varying from immature to mature alterations, resulting from\nAbraxane, and demonstrated that the integrin-specific PET tracer 18F-FPPRGD2\ncan be used to noninvasively monitor such changes. However, changes in the tumor\nvasculature at functional levels such as perfusion and permeability are also important\nfor monitoring Abraxane treatment outcomes in patients with cancer. The purpose\nof this study is to further investigate the vascular response during Abraxane\ntherapy and the effectiveness of its synergistic interaction with cisplatin using\nDynamic contrast enhanced-magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). Thirty MDA-MB-435\ntumor mice were randomized into three groups: PBS control (C group), Abraxane\nonly (A group), and sequential treatment with Abraxane followed by cisplatin\n(A-P group). Tumor volume was monitored based on caliper measurements. A DCE-MRI\nprotocol was performed at baseline and day 3. The Ktrans, Kep\nand Ve were calculated and compared with CD31, \u03b1-SMA, and Ki67\nhistology data. Sequential treatment with Abraxane followed by cisplatin produced\na significantly greater inhibition of tumor growth during the three weeks of\nthe observation period. Decreases in Ktrans and Kep for\nthe A and A-P groups were observed on day 3. Immunohistological staining suggested\nvascular remodeling during the Abraxane therapy. The changes in Ktrans\nand Kep values were correlated with alterations in the permeability\nof the tumor vasculature induced by the Abraxane treatment. In conclusion,\nAbraxane-mediated permeability variations in tumor vasculature can be\nquantitatively visualized by DCE-MRI, making this a\nuseful method for studying the effects of early cancer treatment, especially\nthe early vascular response. Vascular remodeling by Abraxane improves\nthe efficiency of cisplatin delivery and thus results in a favorable\ntreatment outcome.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/DCE-MRI-Derived_Parameters_in_Evaluating_Abraxane-Induced_Early_Vascular_Response_and_the_Effectiveness_of_Its_Synergistic_Interaction_with_Cisplatin/3807621', [u'Radiology and Organ Imaging'], []]
