This disease is characterized by very low plasma\nconcentrations of triglycerides and total cholesterol (under 30mg/dl), and\nundetectable levels of LDL and ApoB. Later in life, ABL is associated with\natypical development of retinitis pigmentosa, coagulopathy, column neuropathy\nand myopathy.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Whole-exome_sequencing_as_diagnostic_tool_in_a_quartet_family_with_Abetalipoproteinemia/3382105', [u'Bioinformatics'], []]
