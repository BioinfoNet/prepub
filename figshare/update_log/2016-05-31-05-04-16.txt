[u'Omapatrilat', ['Amy Winfiled'], u'2016-05-30T07:22:23Z', u'Omapatrilat is an antihypertensive drug which acts by inhibiting angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase. ACE a zinc-containing carbopeptidase, catalyzes the conversion of the decapeptide angiotensin I (AI) to the octapeptide angiotensin II (AII). AII is a potent vasoconstrictor which also triggers the release of aldosterone, a sodium-retaining steroid. Thus ACE raises blood pressure by increasing both vascular resistance and \ufb02uid volume. Effective inhibitors of ACE have been used not only in the treatment of hypertension but in the clinical management of congestive heart failure. Neutral endopeptidase (NEP), like ACE, is a zinc metalloprotease and is found in high concentration in the brush border of the renal proximal tubule. NEP is highly ef\ufb01cient in degrading atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), a 28-amino acid peptide secreted by the heart in response to atrial distension.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Omapatrilat/3406741', [u'Biochemistry', u'Bioinorganic Chemistry', u'Biologically Active Molecules', u'Biomolecular Modelling and Design', u'Catalysis and Mechanisms of Reactions', u'Characterisation of Biological Macromolecules', u'Immunological and Bioassay Methods', u'Medicinal and Biomolecular Chemistry', u'Molecular Medicine', u'Organic Chemistry', u'Solution Chemistry'], []]
