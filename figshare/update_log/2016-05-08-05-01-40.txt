[u'Why conservation biology needs mathematics', ['Stephanie Peacock'], u'2016-05-08T01:29:47Z', u'Abstract: The term conservation biology tends to\nconjure up images of field research in remote locations and weathered-looking\nscientists searching for endangered species, but chalkboards, computers, and \u2013\nyes - mathematics are important tools for the modern-day conservation\nbiologist. Ecological data are often noisy and sparse, making it difficult to\ndraw conclusions about the factors driving change in wildlife populations and\nthe environment. Mathematical models can describe the mechanisms that may\nunderlie patterns in ecological data and increase our power to quantitatively\ntest alternative hypotheses, predict future change, and evaluate the potential\noutcomes of different management scenarios. In an age where government and\nindustry demand evidence before action, mathematics may be the key to\nconservation.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Why_conservation_biology_needs_mathematics/3362167', [u'Population Ecology'], []]
