There were no\nsignificant differences on the total\nincrement of weight (p = 0,68). The carcass render was superior\nfor the castrated animals (74,84) with respect to the control (71,47%),\xa0 being a highly significant difference (p = 0,032)\nfor the castrated group. The consumption of concetrated food was greater in the\ncontrol group (2 784g) in front of the castrated\xa0 lot\xa0 (2\n459g) and the nutritional conversion was better in the castrated animals (3,72)\nwith respect to the control group (4,3). The statistical evaluation showed\xa0 significant diferences in the feed conversion\n(p = 0,019) but not in the total consumption of feed (p = 0,290).\nAfter the slaughtered of the guinea pig, we observed that the weight of the\ndigestive system were less in castrated animal, equivalent to 81 % of the\xa0 digestive aparatus of the control\nanimals.\xa0 In order to confirm that the\ncastration technique had had significant effects,\xa0 histopathological \xa0cuts were made to the testicles. In some\ntesticles severe injuries were observed \xa0in germinal epithelium,\xa0 whereas in others the differentiation was\nshown till the stages of spermatocytes II.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/EFECTO_DE_LA_CASTRACI_N_QUIMICA_CON_ALCOHOL_YODADO_SOBRE_EL_CRECIMIENTO_Y_RENDIMIENTO_DE_LA_CANAL_EN_CUYES_Cavia_porcellus_/3467429', [u'Medicine', u'Pharmacology'], []]
