Proteins from Desulfuromondales\nspecies are highlighted with purple font. Proteins from Desulfuromondales\nspecies with long type IVa pili\nhave an additional orange background. Pilin accessory proteins from e-pili\nharboring species that are not in the order Desulfuromondales are\nhighlighted in red. The remaining organisms included in the trees have long typeIVa\npilin proteins. These phylogenetic trees and identity/similarity matrices\noutlined in Supplementary Table SX demonstrate that pilin accessory proteins\nare relatively conserved and that e-pilin harboring species have the same\naccessory proteins as organisms with long type IVa pilins. In most cases (with the\nexception of PilV, PilW, PilX, and\nPilY1), Desulfuromondales\nproteins form a single monophyletic clade, while accessory proteins from non-Desulfuromondales\ne-pilin harboring genera such as Flexistipes,\nHippea,\nDesulfobacterium,\nDeferribacter,\nDesulfobacula,\nThauera, and\nDesulfobotulus fall\nelsewhere in the phylogenetic trees.
