[u'Antibody Hybridization Dataset Using Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) Probes and Epithelial Cells (Buccal and Contact Epidermal)', ['Christopher Ehrhardt'], u'2016-06-26T18:37:01Z', u'Biological samples were collected from volunteers using the following\nprotocol approved by the VCU-IRB (#HM20000454_CR). For contact epithelial samples contributors rubbed a sterile polypropylene conical tube (P/N 229421; Celltreat Scientific) for five minutes using\ntheir entire hand (i.e., palm and fingers). Cells were then collected from the surface with six sterile pre-wetted swabs (P/N 22037924;\nFisher Scientific) followed by two dry swabs. To elute the cells into solution,\nthe swabs were manually stirred then vortexed for 15 seconds in 10 mL of ultrapure\nwater (18.2 M\u2126\u2219cm). Buccal cells were collected by swabbing the inner cheek surface with a cotton-tipped swab. As before, swabs were mixed in 10mL of ultrapure water to create a cell solution used for subsequent hybridization experiments.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/Antibody_Hybridization_Dataset_Using_Human_Leukocyte_Antigen_HLA_Probes_and_Epithelial_Cells_Buccal_and_Contact_Epidermal_/3457265', [u'Cell Biology', u'Immunology'], []]
