[u'The heritability of creative potential', ['Davide Piffer'], u'2016-07-25T16:06:39Z', u'Creativity is a multi-faceted, multi-factorial\nand polygenic trait. In other words, there are many domains of creativity\n(science, arts, mathematics, culinary, etc); many personality and cognitive\nfactors influence creativity (positively or negatively), and its variation\nbetween individuals is due to many genes. The aim of this study is to build a\nmodel of creative potential based on the evidence accumulated in the literature\nand to investigate the genetic and environmental influences on creative\npotential. Results confirm that creative achievement is the result of high\nintelligence, high openness to experience and novelty seeking, and divergent\nthinking. This study also finds support for the positive link between\npsychopathology and creativity, but it suggests that intelligence can mask this\nassociation, via a possible detrimental role on cognition of sub-clinical\nschizophrenia lying on a continuous spectrum going from mental health to\ninsanity. A verbal measure of divergent thinking was found to be highly heritable\n(67%), with no shared environmental contribution. However, lower heritabilities\nwere found for latent personality factors Openness/Novelty Seeking (0-28%) and\nImpulsivity (26%), but higher for\xa0\nSchizophrenia (52.6%) with no significant shared environmental\ncontribution. This study also provides further support for the use of a\nself-report measure of creative achievement.', u'https://figshare.com/articles/The_heritability_of_creative_potential/3498107', [u'Personality, Abilities and Assessment', u'Biological Psychology (Neuropsychology, Psychopharmacology, Physiological Psychology)', u'Genetics', u'Quantitative Genetics (incl.
